 **ARTICLE II ** _ 

SALE AND PURCHASE_

 



 

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale of Acquired Interests_. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, DFI shall sell, transfer, convey,
assign and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire from DFI,
all of DFI's rights, title and interest in and to the Acquired Interests, free
and clear of all Liens, in exchange for the consideration specified in
_Section 2.2_.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the
Acquired Interests shall be $100,000,000 (the "Base Amount"), subject to
adjustment as provided in _Section 2.4_ and in _Section 5.3(d)_ (as adjusted,
the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be payable in the manner
provided in _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Payments to be Effected at Closing_. At Closing, Buyer
shall:

 



 

(a) transfer $8,000,000 of the Purchase Price (the "Escrow Amount") in
cash to the Escrow Agent to be held pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement entered into as of the Closing Date by
and among Buyer, Newpark and the Escrow Agent in a form mutually acceptable to
the Parties (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in
accordance with the terms thereof, the "Escrow Agreement"); and

 



 

(b) pay to the Newpark Entities an amount equal to the Estimated Purchase
Price less the Escrow Amount.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) For the purpose of determining the Estimated Purchase Price, at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Newpark shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Buyer the Estimated Balance Sheet and a statement
(the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth a good faith estimate of the
Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the "Estimated Net Working
Capital") and the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, each as shown on the
Estimated Balance Sheet, and the components and calculation thereof,
determined in accordance with _Section 2.4(f)_. The Estimated Balance Sheet
and the Estimated Closing Statement shall be subject to review by Buyer, and
Newpark and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute
regarding the Estimated Balance Sheet or the Estimated Closing Statement prior
to the Closing; _provided, however_ , that if any item of dispute regarding
the Estimated Balance Sheet or the Estimated Closing Statement and the
calculations set forth therein is not resolved by agreement in writing between
Newpark and Buyer by the second Business Day prior to the Closing Date, then
Newpark's estimate of such disputed item, together with any resolved disputed
items, shall be deemed final solely for purposes of determining the Estimated
Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Indebtedness.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) The Estimated Closing Statement shall be used to determine the
Estimated Purchase Price by adjusting the Base Amount as follows:

 



 

(i) To the extent the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the
Target Net Working Capital Amount (such difference being herein referred to as
the "Estimated Net Working Capital Excess Amount"), the Base Amount shall be
increased by the amount of the Estimated Net Working Capital Excess Amount. To
the extent the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net
Working Capital Amount (such difference being herein referred to as the
"Estimated Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount"), the Base Amount shall be
reduced by the amount of the Estimated Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount.

 



 

(ii) The Base Amount shall be decreased by an amount equal to the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 5.1(f)_ , within ninety (90) calendar days
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Newpark the Final Balance Sheet and a statement (the "Final Closing
Statement") setting forth the actual Net Working Capital as of the Effective
Time (the "Final Net Working Capital") and the Final Closing Indebtedness,
each as shown on the Final Balance Sheet, and the components and calculation
thereof, determined in accordance with _Section 2.4(f)_. The Final Closing
Statement shall be used to determine the Final Purchase Price, by adjusting
the Base Amount (without application of any adjustments to the Base Amount
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ ) as follows:

 



 

(i) To the extent the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Target
Net Working Capital Amount (such difference being herein referred to as the
"Final Net Working Capital Excess Amount"), the Base Amount shall be increased
by the amount of the Final Net Working Capital Excess Amount. To the extent
the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital
Amount (such difference being herein referred to as the "Final Net Working
Capital Deficiency Amount"), the Base Amount shall be reduced by the amount of
the Final Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount.

 



 

(ii) The Base Amount shall be decreased by an amount equal to the Final
Closing Indebtedness.

 



 

(d) If the Final Closing Statement reflects a difference between the
Estimated Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price, Newpark shall have
thirty (30) calendar days following the receipt of the Final Balance Sheet and
the Final Closing Statement to review the components and calculation of the
Final Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Indebtedness. During such
thirty (30) calendar day period, Buyer shall provide Newpark and its legal and
accounting advisors with reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
all financial information used in the preparation of the Final Balance Sheet
and the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Closing
Indebtedness. If Newpark objects to any portion of the Final Balance Sheet or
Final Closing Statement and Buyer's calculation of the amounts set forth
therein, Newpark may send notice to Buyer specifying the reasons for Newpark's
objections (the "Objection Notice") no later than 5:00 p.m., Houston, Texas
time, on the final day of such thirty (30) calendar day period. The failure of
Newpark to send the Objection Notice within such thirty (30) calendar day
period shall be deemed to be an acceptance by Newpark of the Final Balance
Sheet, the Final Closing Statement and the amounts set forth therein. If Buyer
and Newpark agree on all matters in the Final Balance Sheet and the Final
Closing Statement, or if Newpark otherwise fails to timely object to such
matters, then:

 



 



 

 



   



 

(i) if the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase
Price, then such difference shall be paid by Buyer to Newpark (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing
by Newpark) within three (3) Business Days of Newpark's acceptance, or deemed
acceptance, of the Final Closing Statement; and

 



 

(ii) if the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase
Price, then such difference shall be paid by Newpark to Buyer (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing
by Buyer) within three (3) Business Days of Newpark's acceptance, or deemed
acceptance, of the Final Closing Statement. The amount of the difference
between the Final Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price (whether a
positive or negative number) is referred to herein as the "Final Adjustment
Amount".

 



 

(e) In the event Newpark has provided a timely Objection Notice to Buyer,
and Newpark and Buyer are unable to agree on the calculations set forth in the
Final Closing Statement within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt by
Buyer of such Objection Notice, such dispute between Newpark and Buyer with
respect to such calculations and the Final Adjustment Amount shall be resolved
by a recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Newpark and Buyer and
who shall not be Buyer's, Lariat's or Newpark's accounting firm (the
"Accounting Arbitrator"). The Accounting Arbitrator shall be engaged within
fifteen (15) calendar days after the expiration of the fifteen (15) day period
following delivery of the Objection Notice. If either Buyer or Newpark fails
to take action with respect to any matter referred to in the previous
sentences of this _Section 2.4(e)_ , then if Buyer has failed to take action,
Newpark, or if Newpark has failed to take action, Buyer, may engage the
Accounting Arbitrator on behalf of all Parties. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall make such review and examination of the relevant facts and documents as
the Accounting Arbitrator deems appropriate, and an independent determination
of Final Net Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness and the Final
Adjustment Amount, and shall permit Buyer and Newpark to make a written
presentation of their respective determinations of such amounts, _provided,
however_ , that the Accounting Arbitrator shall require all facts, documents
and written presentations from Buyer and Newpark to be completely submitted
within thirty (30) calendar days after the Accounting Arbitrator has been
engaged. Within thirty (30) calendar days after the date required for
submission of such facts, documents and written presentations, and regardless
of whether such submissions shall have been made, the Accounting Arbitrator
shall resolve all disputed items in writing and shall prepare and deliver its
decision, which shall be final and binding upon the Parties without further
recourse or collateral attack and, as to each disputed matter, which shall
accept (i) either Buyer's or Newpark's position on each disputed matter set
forth in the Objection Notice or (ii) the stipulated position of Buyer and
Newpark with respect to any matter which prior to such stipulation was
disputed. Any required payments by Buyer to Newpark, on the one hand, or by
Newpark to Buyer, on the other hand, based on such determination shall be made
within three (3) Business Days of the final resolution of such dispute by the
Parties, or the Accounting Arbitrator, as applicable. All fees and expenses of
the Accounting Arbitrator shall be paid by the Party who is the least
successful in such process, which shall be determined by comparing (A) the
position asserted by each Party on all disputed matters taken together, with
each matter weighted by its financial significance, to (B) the final decision
of the Accounting Arbitrator on all disputed matters taken together. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, the "disputed matters" shall be all
matters raised in the Objection Notice, and the "position asserted" by Buyer
and Newpark shall be determined by reference to their respective written
presentations submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to this _Section
2.4(e)_. The Accounting Arbitrator shall not preside over any hearing of the
Parties nor permit the Parties to make any oral arguments. Buyer and Newpark
shall pay their respective advisor's fees, charges and expenses incurred by
such Person in connection with the dispute.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Net Working Capital" shall (i) be
calculated as of the Effective Time on a combined basis for the Transferred
Entities and (ii) mean the amount equal to the current assets of the
Transferred Entities minus the current liabilities (including accrued property
taxes and, to the extent not payable by Newpark, employee liabilities relating
to periods prior to the Closing) of the Transferred Entities computed in
accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the most recent Annual
Financial Statement, except that (x) current liabilities shall include: (A)
the aggregate amount of all outstanding checks of the Transferred Entities as
of the Effective Time, and (B) an accrual for 2014 employee bonuses in the
aggregate amount of not less than $100,000, and (y) the current assets and the
current liabilities shall not include: (A) intercompany receivables and
payables between or among the Transferred Entities, Newpark Entities and their
respective Affiliates; (B) any bank or other funded Indebtedness of Newpark;
(C) any liability for income or franchise taxes payable by any of the
Transferred Entities that are actually paid or payable, when due, by Newpark
or one of its Affiliates other than the Transferred Entities; (D) cash and
cash equivalents; and (E) accrued compensation or bonuses to employees listed
on _Schedule 3.12(e)(ix)_ that will be payable by Newpark on or after
Closing. _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement sets forth an illustrative calculation
of the Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2013.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 2.4_ shall not be subject to the
provisions of _ARTICLE VIII_ hereof or any limitations of liability set forth
therein.

Section 2.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Newpark and Buyer will
cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree,
within thirty (30) days of the final determination of the Final Adjustment
Amount, upon an allocation of the Purchase Price among the assets of NES, the
Mississippi Real Property Option, and the covenants set forth in _Section 5.7_
, in compliance with the principles of Code Section 1060 and applicable
Treasury Regulations thereunder. If Newpark and Buyer agree to such
allocation, Newpark and Buyer agree to timely and properly prepare, execute
and file with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Code Section 1060 an
IRS Form 8594 or any successor form thereto regarding the allocation of the
Purchase Price in accordance with such agreed allocation; _provided, however_
, that (i) Buyer's cost for the Acquired Interests may differ from the total
amount allocated hereunder to reflect the inclusion in the total cost of items
(for example, capitalized acquisition costs) not included in the amount so
allocated and (ii) the amount realized by the Newpark Entities may differ from
the total amount allocated hereunder to reflect transaction costs that reduce
the amount realized for federal income Tax purposes. Except as required
pursuant to applicable Law, none of the Parties, directly or indirectly,
through a Subsidiary or Affiliate or otherwise, will take a position on any
Tax Return or in any audit or examination by, or any judicial proceeding
before, any Taxing Authority that is in any way inconsistent with such agreed
allocation; _provided, however_ , that none of the Newpark Entities, Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to litigate any
challenge to such allocation of the Purchase Price by any Governmental Entity.
If Newpark and Buyer are unable to agree on an allocation of the Purchase
Price among the assets of NES, the Mississippi Real Property Option, and the
covenants set forth in _Section 5.7_ within thirty (30) days of the final
determination of the Final Adjustment Amount, the Newpark Entities and Buyer
may file their respective Tax Returns allocating the Purchase Price in the
manner each such Party believes appropriate, provided such allocation is in
accordance with applicable Law. The Parties will promptly inform one another
of any challenge by any Taxing Authority to any allocation made pursuant to
this _Section 2.6_ and agree to consult and keep one another reasonably
informed with respect to the status of, and any discussion, proposal or
submission with respect to, such challenge.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 2.7 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer or its designee and the Transferred Entities
shall be entitled to withhold and deduct from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Buyer or its designee or
any Transferred Entity is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , that if withholding could be avoided by the
provision of documentation by a Newpark Entity to Buyer or a Transferred
Entity, then no withholding or deduction shall be made pursuant to this
_Section 2.7_ unless a Newpark Entity has failed to provide such documentation
as reasonably required by Buyer or a Transferred Entity to enable Buyer and
the Transferred Entities to avoid such withholding. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

foreign limited liability company in each jurisdiction where the business it
is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes

expected to result in a material Liability to any Transferred Entity. Correct
and complete copies of the Governing Documents, minute books and record books
of each of the Transferred Entities have been made available to Buyer.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Capitalization of the Transferred Entities_.

require such entity to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the
Transferred Interests or any other ownership interest or security in any of
the Transferred Entities or (ii) any voting trust, voting agreement,

of the Newpark Entities has all necessary corporate or limited liability
company power and authority, and has taken all corporate or limited liability
company action necessary, to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents to which such Newpark Entity is or will be a
party and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

thereof. Each Newpark Entity's execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the execution, delivery and performance of such Transaction
Documents by such Newpark Entity, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly and validly authorized by all
requisite corporate or limited liability company action on the part of each
Newpark Entity. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and

(as applicable), will constitute the valid, legal and binding agreement of
each of the Newpark Entities (as applicable), enforceable against each in
accordance with their terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and except that equitable remedies may be granted only in the

constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a material
default (or give rise to the creation of any Lien or any right of termination,
amendment, modification, cancellation or acceleration) or require the Consent
of or other action by any Person under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract or Order, arbitration award, judgment or decree or
other instrument binding on any of the Newpark Entities or any of the

of any violation or alleged violation of or under, or any investigative or
remediation obligation under, any Environmental Law or Permit by any of the
Transferred Entities.

(a) The Transferred Entities are, and at all times since January 1, 2011
have been, operating in compliance, in all material respects, with all Laws
applicable to any of the Transferred Entities or the Business. Since January

and the conduct of the Business as currently operated, or the ownership,

boats owned, leased, used or operated by any of the Transferred Entities,
except where any failure to hold or be in compliance with any such Permit or
the failure of any such Permit to be in full force and effect would not
reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability to any Transferred
Entity. No Transferred Entity has entered into any written variance agreement
with any Governmental Entity which, either individually or in the aggregate,
materially detracts from the value of the property subject thereto or
materially interferes with the continued use and operation of the property or
asset as presently used or operated. Each Permit (other than Permits held

(c) The Transferred Entities are, and at all times since January 1, 2010

Security Act, and regulations related thereto, the Transferred Entities have
in place written policies and procedures applicable to each barge fleeting
facility, and are in compliance in all material respects with such policies
and procedures, and have made available to Buyer copies of all such policies
and procedures. Each of the Transferred Entities is a "citizen of the United
States" within the meaning of 46 U.S.C. § 50501 eligible to own vessels

by any of the Transferred Entities, as set forth on _Schedule 3.17(d)_ , (i)

conditions thereof, to provide equity financing in the amounts set forth

has been amended or modified, and the respective commitments contained in the
Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.
Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is in full force
and effect as of the date of this Agreement and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties
thereto. The obligations to make the Financing available to Buyer pursuant to

this Agreement, (i) none of the Financing Commitments has been supplemented,

with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Buyer under any term or condition of the Financing

be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it or its Affiliates contained in the Financing Commitments and

other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid by it on or prior
to the date of this Agreement and shall in the future pay any such fees as

set forth herein, including the payment of the Purchase Price and all related
fees and expenses associated with such transactions.

Governmental Entity to the extent, and only to the extent, relating to any
Divestitures, provided that it shall allow Newpark to participate in each and
every communication with Governmental Entities relating to any Divestitures.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) The obligations of Buyer to undertake any Divestiture or other action
pursuant to _Section 5.3(c)_ above shall be subject to the provisions of this
_Section 5.3(d)_. In the event any Governmental Entity shall require a
Divestiture in order to (i) obtain HSR Approval or (ii) avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any permanent or preliminary injunction or other
Order in any suit or proceeding under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law, (collectively, a "Governmental Consent"), the following terms
shall be applicable:

 



 

(i) If the Agreed Value of the Divested Assets is less than $4,000,000 _,_
Buyer shall assume all risks and responsibilities for such Divestiture as
necessary in order to obtain the required Governmental Consent and the
Purchase Price shall not be adjusted because of any required Divestiture.

 



 

(ii) If the Agreed Value of the Divested Assets is equal to or greater
than $4,000,000 and less than $10,000,000 _,_ Buyer shall assume all risks and
responsibilities for such Divestiture as necessary in order to obtain the
required Governmental Consent; provided, however, that the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the amount of the Agreed Value in excess of $4,000,000.

 



 

(iii) If the Agreed Value of the Divested Assets is equal to or greater
than $10,000,000, then Buyer shall have the option to terminate this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by providing Newpark
written notice, within fifteen (15) days of the date upon which the Agreed
Value of the Divested Assets is finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 5.3_ , of Buyer's election to either continue with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to terminate this Agreement. If Buyer fails
to timely provide such notice to Newpark, this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been terminated, without any further action of any Party hereto, pursuant
to _Section 9.1(e)_ below. If Buyer timely notifies Newpark of Buyer's
election to continue with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Buyer shall assume all risks and responsibilities for such Divestiture as
necessary in order to obtain the required Governmental Consent; provided,
however, that the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of $6,000,000.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.3_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event shall Buyer be required to agree to
or effect a Divesture of any of (A) the Big Hill Facilities, (B) the Fannett,
Texas facilities, (C) the Port Fourchon, Louisiana facilities, (D) the Venice,
Louisiana facilities, or (E) the Port Arthur, Texas facilities (each, a "Core
Asset" and, collectively, the "Core Assets") and, in the event that the FTC,
DOJ, any federal or state court of the United States or any other Governmental
Entity propose or instruct Buyer or the Transferred Entities to effect a
Divestiture of any Core Asset, then Buyer shall have the option to terminate
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
providing Newpark written notice, within twenty (20) days of Buyer's receipt
of such proposal or instruction, of Buyer's election to either continue with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to terminate this
Agreement. If Buyer fails to timely provide such notice to Newpark, this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been terminated, without any further action
of any Party hereto, pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ below. If Buyer timely
notifies Newpark of Buyer's election to continue with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall assume all risks and
responsibilities for such Divestiture as necessary in order to obtain the
required Governmental Consent and the Purchase Price shall be reduced, if at
all, in accordance with _Sections 5.3(d)(i)_ through _(iii)_ above.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Agreed Value" of any Divested
Asset shall be the amount equal to: (A) (x) the number obtained by dividing
$100,000,000 by the LTM EBITDA multiplied by (y) the Divested Asset EBITDA
(the "EBITDA Method"), or (B) if the Divested Asset is a property or asset of
the Transferred Entities, Buyer or OCS for which the Parties reasonably
determine that the EBITDA Method will not result in a fair determination of
the Agreed Value, Buyer may calculate the Agreed Value utilizing a discounted
cash flow analysis based upon the present value of the estimated future cash
flows from such Divested Asset over a ten (10) year period beginning January
1, 2014 and ending December 31, 2023, using a discount rate of ten percent
(10%) per annum (the "DCF Method"). If a Divestiture is required to obtain any
necessary Governmental Consent, promptly following the determination that such
Divestiture is required Buyer shall provide written notice to Newpark (a
"Divestiture Notice") which shall identify the proposed Divested Assets and
set forth Buyer's calculation of the Agreed Value relating to such assets.
Newpark shall have ten (10) calendar days following the receipt of such
Divestiture Notice to review the calculation of the Agreed Value. If Newpark
and Buyer are unable to agree on the calculation of such Agreed Value, such
dispute shall be resolved as follows: (i) if the Agreed Value was determined
on the basis of the EBITDA Method, any such dispute shall be submitted to the
Accounting Arbitrator selected in the manner provided in _Section 2.4(e)_ ,
and (ii) if the Agreed Value was determined on the basis of the DCF Method,
any such dispute shall be submitted to a valuation expert mutually acceptable
to Buyer and Newpark who shall determine the Agreed Value in accordance with
the DCF Method. If Buyer and Newpark are unable to mutually agree upon a
valuation expert within twenty (20) calendar days following the receipt of
such Divestiture Notice, Newpark and Buyer shall each select a valuation
expert, and the two valuation experts shall select a third valuation expert
who will determine, on its own, the Agreed Value of such Divested Asset in
accordance with the preceding sentence. Any costs and expenses of an
Accounting Arbitrator or valuation experts shall be shared equally by Newpark
and Buyer.

 



 

(f) For purposes hereof, "Divested Asset EBITDA" shall mean the net income
of the Divested Asset plus interest expense, federal, state and local taxes
based on income, depreciation and amortization of the Divested Asset for the
twelve month period ended December 31, 2013 as reflected in the Annual
Financial Statements and the accounting records used in the preparation of
such financial statements, less the amount of general and administrative
expenses allocable to such Divested Asset in proportion to the relative
revenue contributions of the Divested Asset during such period to the extent
not otherwise taken into account in the determination of the net income of the
Divested Asset.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, "LTM EBITDA" means, subject to the
adjustments below, an amount equal to the combined net income, calculated in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied, plus interest expenses, federal,
state and local taxes based on income, depreciation and amortization of the
Transferred Entities for the twelve (12) calendar month period ending December
31, 2013. In calculating the LTM EBITDA, the Parties agree to the following
adjustments: (A) asset impairments and similar non-cash charges shall be
disregarded; and (B) any extraordinary, non-recurring and unusual gains,
losses, or expenses on sales of assets or businesses shall be disregarded.

 



 

(h) From the date of this Agreement through the date of termination of the
required waiting period under the HSR Act, the Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to not take any action that could reasonably
be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of any HSR Approval.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Further Assurances_. If at any time after the Closing any
further reasonable action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
and intents of this Agreement, each of the Parties will take such further
action (including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents) as any other Party reasonably may request, all at the requesting
Party's expense (unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under _ARTICLE VIII_ ).

 



 

Section 5.5 _Conduct of Business_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or
the termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise specifically required

operation;

(x) except as may be required as a result of a change in Law or in GAAP,

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.5_ to the contrary, Newpark and
its Subsidiaries shall have the right, prior to the Closing, to remove from
any Transferred Entity all cash and cash equivalents (other than restricted

Section 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters; Supplement to Newpark
Disclosure Schedule_. Prior to the Closing, each Party shall give prompt
written notice to the other Parties of (a) any development or event that would
cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ to not be satisfied,
(b) any failure by such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
agreement or condition to the Closing to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement or (c) any development or event that would cause any of
the representations and warranties of such Party set forth in this Agreement
to not be true and correct in all respects at and as of the Closing as though
such representations and warranties had been made at and as of the Closing
(except for representations and warranties that expressly address matters only
as of a particular date or only with respect to a specific period of time). In
the case of any matter disclosed by the Newpark Entities pursuant to clause
(c) of the immediately preceding sentence, (i) if the development or event
(individually or collectively with all other such developments and events)
would not cause the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ to not be
satisfied, then the notice delivered by the Newpark Entities pursuant to this
_Section 5.6_ shall be deemed to have amended the Newpark Disclosure Schedule,
to have qualified the representations and warranties of Newpark contained in
_ARTICLE III_ , and to have cured any breach thereof that otherwise might have
existed under this Agreement by reason of such disclosed development or event,
and (ii) if the development or event (individually or collectively with all
other such developments and events) would cause the condition set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ to not be satisfied, then the notice delivered by the Newpark
Entities pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not be deemed to have amended
the Newpark Disclosure Schedule in any respect, nor to have qualified or
otherwise impacted in any respect the representations and warranties of
Newpark contained in _ARTICLE III_ , nor to have cured or otherwise diminished
any breach thereof that might exist under this Agreement by reason of such
disclosed development or event.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) a Newpark
Change of Control (the "Restricted Period") neither Newpark nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, except as permitted by this _Section 5.7(a)_ , engage in
the business of providing environmental services in the United States
(including the States of Alabama, Mississippi and Texas, and each of the
Louisiana parishes listed on _Schedule 5.7(a)_ ) or the Gulf of Mexico,
including any waste management, collection, receiving, transferring,
processing or disposal services that are, in any material respect, similar to
or competitive with, the Business as being conducted by the Transferred
Entities on the Closing Date (the "Covered Business"). This _Section 5.7(a)_
shall cease to be applicable to any Person at such time as it is no longer an
Affiliate or Subsidiary of Newpark.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_ , nothing in this
Agreement shall preclude, prohibit or restrict Newpark or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries from (i) acquiring, owning or holding up to 5% of
the outstanding securities of any entity whose securities are listed and
traded on a national securities exchange or market or any securities required
to be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or (ii) engaging
in any manner in any business activity that would otherwise violate this
_Section 5.7_ that is acquired from any Person (an "Acquired Business") or is
carried on by any Person that is acquired by or combined with Newpark or a
Subsidiary of Newpark at any time during the Restricted Period (an "Acquired
Company"); provided, that, if the aggregate consolidated revenues of the
Acquired Business or the Acquired Company attributable to the Covered Business
for the fiscal year ending prior to the completion of such purchase or
acquisition is in excess of 5% of the consolidated revenues of Newpark and its
Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending prior to such purchase or acquisition
(the "Divestiture Threshold"), then, as soon as promptly practicable, Newpark
or such Subsidiary shall dispose of all or a portion of the Acquired Business
or the Acquired Company that comprises the Covered Business so that the
aggregate consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ending prior to the
completion of such purchase or acquisition of the remaining portion of the
Acquired Business or the Acquired Company that comprises the Covered Business
shall be less than the Divestiture Threshold.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) During the Restricted Period, neither Newpark nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit for employment or
employ any of the individuals listed on _Schedule 5.7(c)_ or (ii) solicit for
employment or employ any Transferred Employee (other than the individuals
listed on _Schedule 5.7(c)_ ); _provided, however_ , that this clause (ii)
shall not prohibit Newpark or any of its Subsidiaries from making general
solicitations not specifically targeted at any Transferred Employees or from
employing persons (other than the individuals listed on _Schedule 5.7(c)_ )
who respond to such general solicitations, or from employing or hiring any
person (other than the individuals listed on _Schedule 5.7(c)_ ) who initiates
discussions regarding employment without any solicitation by Newpark or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) During the Restricted Period, neither Newpark nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, (i) influence or attempt to
influence any customers, distributors or suppliers of any of the Transferred
Entities to divert their business to any competitor of the Transferred
Entities or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such
customer, distributor or supplier and the Transferred Entities (including any
senior management member of Newpark or any of its Subsidiaries making any
disparaging or negative statements or communications about the Transferred
Entities), or (ii) take any action that is designed or intended to have the
effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, or other business associate of
any of Transferred Entities from maintaining the same business relationships
with the Transferred Entities after the Closing as it maintained with the
Transferred Entities prior to the Closing.

 



 

(e) Each Newpark Entity agrees and acknowledges that: (i) the provisions
of this _Section 5.7_ do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to
protect the goodwill, Confidential Information or other business interests of
the Transferred Entities; (ii) such provisions contain reasonable limitations
as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained; (iii)
the consideration provided under this Agreement, including any amounts or
benefits provided under _ARTICLE II_ , is sufficient to compensate such
Newpark Entity for the restrictions contained in this _Section 5.7_ ; and (iv)
in any Legal Proceeding that may arise out of or relate to the provisions of
this _Section 5.7_ , the Newpark Entities will have the burden of proving that
the non-competition covenants contained herein do not meet the criteria set
forth in Texas Business and Commerce Code § 15.50 _et seq_. Each Newpark
Entity agrees that it will not assert that, and it should not be considered
that, any provision of this _Section 5.7_ is otherwise void, voidable or
unenforceable or should be voided or held unenforceable. It is the intention
of the Parties that, if any court, arbitrator or tribunal construes any
provision or clause of this _Section 5.7_ to be illegal, void or unenforceable
because of the duration of such provision or the area or subject matter
covered thereby, such court, arbitrator or tribunal shall reduce the duration,
area, or subject matter of such provision, and, in its reduced form, such
provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.

 



 

(f) Each Newpark Entity agrees and acknowledges that (i) any breach by it
of any of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.7_ would cause
irreparable damage to Buyer and the Transferred Entities for which monetary
damages and other remedies at law may not be adequate, and (ii) Buyer and the
Transferred Entities will be entitled to seek a restraining order, an
injunction, specific performance, or other form of equitable or extraordinary
relief from any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain any threatened or
further breach of this _Section 5.7_ or to require such Newpark Entity to
perform its obligations under this _Section 5.7_ , which right to equitable or
extraordinary relief will not be exclusive of, but will be in addition to, all
other remedies to which Buyer and the Transferred Entities may be entitled
under this Agreement, at law, or in equity (including, the right to recover
monetary damages). The agreement of each Newpark Entity contained in this
_Section 5.7_ is given as an inducement to, and as part of the consideration
for, Buyer's purchase of the Acquired Interests under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Press Releases and Public Announcement_. Except as required
by a court of competent jurisdiction or applicable Law, including applicable
securities laws, regulations and listing standards of any securities exchange,
none of the Parties nor any of their respective Affiliates shall, without the
prior consent of the other Parties (which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), make any public announcement or press release with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that Buyer and its
Affiliates (i) are permitted to report and disclose the terms and status of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to their current and
prospective investors, members, partners, equityholders and professional
advisors, so long as such Persons are informed by Buyer or its Affiliates of
the confidential nature of such information and are directed to treat such
information confidentially, and (ii) after the Closing, shall be permitted to
disclose the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby on their
websites and otherwise in the ordinary course of their business from and after
the Closing.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.9 _Tax Matters_. 

 



 

(a) _Filing Responsibility_. Newpark shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Transferred Entities
after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period other than
with respect to a Straddle Period. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and
without a change of any election or any accounting method and shall be
submitted by Newpark to Buyer (together with schedules, statements and, to the
extent requested by Buyer, supporting documentation) at least forty (40) days
prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If Buyer
objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it shall, within ten (10) days
after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Newpark in writing that it so
objects, specifying with particularity any such item and stating the specific
factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall
be duly delivered, Buyer and Newpark shall negotiate in good faith and use
their reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and Newpark are
unable to reach such agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by Newpark
of such notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Accounting
Arbitrator and any determination by the Accounting Arbitrator shall be final.
The Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve any disputed items within twenty (20)
days of having the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may
require. If the Accounting Arbitrator is unable to resolve any disputed items
before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as
modified by Buyer and then amended to reflect the Accounting Arbitrator's
resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
borne equally by Buyer and Newpark. The preparation and filing of any Tax
Return of a Transferred Entity for a Straddle Period or a Post-Closing Tax
Period shall be exclusively within the control of Buyer.

 



 

(b) _Cooperation_. Each Party will cooperate fully in all reasonable
respects with respect to Tax matters and provide one another with such
information as is reasonably requested to enable the requesting Party to
complete and file all Tax Returns it may be required to file, or cause to be
filed, with respect to the Transferred Entities, to respond to Tax audits,
inquiries or other Tax proceedings and to otherwise satisfy Tax requirements.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's
request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such audit, inquiry or other proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder and to testify in any such
audit, inquiry or other proceeding. The Party requesting cooperation under
this _Section 5.9(b)_ will pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
other Party. Each Party will cooperate with the other Party in connection with
any Tax Claim, including keeping the other Party informed of the receipt of
notice or status of any such Tax Claim.

 



 

(c) _Straddle Periods_. In the case of any Straddle Period of the
Transferred Entities, the amount of Taxes allocable to Newpark for purposes of
this Agreement will, with respect to ad valorem or similar property taxes, be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and,
with respect to all other Taxes, will be determined by closing the books of
the Transferred Entities as of the taxable year ended on and including the
Closing Date.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Taxes arising from the sale of the
Acquired Interests shall be borne equally by Buyer on the one hand, and the
Newpark Entities on the other.

 



 

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements and all powers of attorney with respect to or involving the
Transferred Entities shall be terminated prior to the date of this Agreement,
and, after the Closing, neither Buyer nor the Transferred Entities will be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

(f) _Tax Indemnification_. Newpark will defend, indemnify and hold Buyer
harmless from and against and be liable for all Damages arising out of or
related to any and all Taxes (i) of the Transferred Entities for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, (ii) of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which any of the Transferred Entities is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local or
foreign law or regulation, (iii) relating to any Deferred Tax Liability, and
(iv) any Person (other than a Transferred Entity) imposed on any of the
Transferred Entities for any period as a transferee or successor with respect
to a transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date, by applicable Law,
Contract or otherwise; _provided, however_ , Newpark's liability for Damages
arising out of or related to Taxes under this _Section 5.9(f)_ shall be
reduced, dollar for dollar, to the extent that any Taxes to which such Damages
relate were included in current liabilities of the Transferred Entities for
purposes of determining the Final Net Working Capital. In the event of any
conflict between the terms of this _Section 5.9(f)_ and the terms of _ARTICLE
VIII_ with respect to any matter described in the immediately preceding
sentence, the terms of this _Section 5.9(f)_ shall control; provided, that any
liability of Newpark for indemnification under this _Section 5.9_ shall be
limited to the Cap of $8,000,000 as provided in _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_.

 



 

(g) _Contests_. Buyer agrees to give written notice to Newpark within
twenty (20) days of the receipt of any written notice by a Transferred Entity,
Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates which involves the assertion of any claim,
or the commencement of any action, in respect of which an indemnity may be
sought by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ (a "Tax Claim"); _provided_ ,
that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect Buyer's right to
indemnification hereunder for such Tax Claim except to the extent (and only to
the extent) Newpark has been actually prejudiced by such failure to comply.
Buyer shall control the contest or resolution of any Tax Claim, _provided,
however_ , that Buyer shall obtain the prior written consent of Newpark (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into
any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim; and, _provided
further_ , that Newpark shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose, the fees and
expenses of which separate counsel shall be borne solely by Newpark. In the
event of any conflict between the terms of this _Section 5.9(g)_ and the terms
of _ARTICLE VIII_ with respect to any matter arising out of or relating to a
Tax Claim (including the defense and settlement thereof), the terms of this
_Section 5.9(g)_ shall control.

 



 

(h) _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification
payment pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 



 

(i) _Survival_. The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive for
the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations plus sixty (60)
days.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.10 _Labor Matters_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing until ninety (90) days thereafter, neither
Buyer, the Transferred Entities nor any Affiliates thereof shall cause any
"employment losses" (as that term is defined in the WARN Act) that would give
rise to any obligations or liabilities of Newpark or its Affiliates under the
WARN Act or any similar state or local Law.

 



 

(b) Newpark and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in connection with any
required notification to, or any required consultation with, the employees,
employee representatives, work councils, unions, labor boards and relevant
Governmental Entities concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.11 _No Shop_. From and after the date hereof until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing Date, Newpark shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including the other Newpark Entities and the
Transferred Entities) and the directors, officers, employees, representatives
and agents of Newpark and its Affiliates not to, do any of the following,
directly or indirectly, with or for the benefit of any third party (other than
Buyer regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement): (i) discuss,
negotiate, authorize, assist, participate in, recommend, propose or enter
into, either as the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired
corporation or other entity, any transaction (or series of transactions)
involving a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, transfer,
sale, conveyance, business combination, purchase or disposition of (A) all or
any portion of the Business or all or any substantial portion of the assets or
properties of the Transferred Entities, or (B) any membership, partnership or
other equity interest in any of the Transferred Entities (any such
transaction, an "Acquisition Transaction"), or (ii) facilitate, engage in,
encourage, solicit or initiate discussions, negotiations or submissions of
proposals or offers from any third party in respect of an Acquisition
Transaction. Should any Newpark Entity or any Transferred Entity or any of
their respective representatives or agents receive any inquiry, proposal or
offer regarding any Acquisition Transaction from and after the date hereof
until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
the Newpark Entities shall, subject to any agreements of confidentiality,
promptly (and in any case within one Business Day) inform Buyer of such
inquiry, proposal or offer, the terms thereof, and the name of the Person
making such inquiry, proposal or offer.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Intercompany Accounts_. At or prior to the Closing, the
Newpark Entities shall cause all intercompany accounts between the Transferred
Entities, on one hand, and Newpark and its other Affiliates, on the other
hand, to be fully settled or otherwise eliminated.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Termination of Intercompany Agreements_. The Newpark
Entities shall cause all Contracts, including all obligations to provide
goods, services or other benefits, between Newpark and/or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than any Transferred Entity), on the one hand, and any of
the Transferred Entities, on the other hand, to be terminated effective as of
or at a time prior to the Closing without any party thereto having any
continuing obligation to the other, except for the Contracts listed in
_Schedule 5.13_.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Use of Names, etc._ Within 60 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause the Transferred Entities to file amendments to their
Governing Documents with the applicable Governmental Entities changing the
names of the Transferred Entities to names that do not include the word
"Newpark" or any name confusingly or misleadingly similar thereto, such
amendments to be effective as soon as practicable following the filing dates
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its Affiliates may use the name
"Newpark," the word "NES" and all other Trademarks owned or licensed by
Newpark or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) and used in
connection with the Business as of the Closing on any materials distributed or
available to customers until the earlier of (i) 180 days (30 days with respect
to the name "Newpark") after the Closing Date or (ii) the exhaustion of
inventory in existence as of the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law, in
each case, in a mutually agreed transitional manner. Thereafter, Buyer shall
not use such Trademarks, other than (i) in a neutral, non-trademark sense to
discuss the history of the Business, or (ii) as required by applicable Law.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.15 _Buyer Financing_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange the
Financing as promptly as practicable, on substantially the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate and finalize definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing substantially on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Buyer in such definitive agreements that
are within the control of Buyer (or any Affiliate of Buyer) and (iii) comply
with its obligations under the Financing Commitments. In the event any portion
of the Financing becomes unavailable from any of the counterparties to the
Financing Commitments on substantially the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Financing Commitments, and such portion is reasonably required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall
promptly notify Newpark and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms
substantially similar to those contained in the Financing Commitments that
will still enable Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
but no later than the Termination Date. Buyer shall deliver to Newpark true
and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide Buyer with any portion of the
Financing. Buyer shall promptly provide Newpark with true, complete and
correct copies of any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification
or waiver of the Financing Commitments or any definitive agreement relating to
the Financing and shall keep Newpark reasonably apprised of material
developments relating to the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer shall give Newpark prompt notice (x) of any material breach
or default under any Financing Commitment or any definitive agreement related
to the Financing by any party thereto of which Buyer becomes aware and (y) of
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication, in each case
from any Financing source with respect to any actual or potential breach,
default, termination or repudiation of any provisions of any Financing
Commitment or any definitive agreement related to the Financing by any party
thereto.

 



 

(b) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, the Newpark Entities shall, and shall
cause the Transferred Entities and their representatives to, provide such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer to assist Buyer and its
Affiliates and representatives in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing, including (i) providing to Buyer from time to time information
regarding the Transferred Entities and their industry reasonably requested by
the Lender and assisting with the identification of any portion of such
information that constitutes material non-public information and, upon the
reasonable request of Buyer, using commercially reasonable efforts to update
any such information, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, offering documents, business projections and
similar marketing documents required in connection with the Financing, (iii)
as promptly as practicable, furnishing Buyer and its Financing sources
information reasonably requested by any of them, (iv) permitting the Lender to
evaluate the Transferred Entities' current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purposes
of establishing collateral arrangements and establishing bank and other
accounts in connection with the foregoing, and (v) as of the Closing Date,
taking all corporate actions reasonable necessary to authorize the
consummation of the Financing; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this _Section 5.15(b)_ , nothing in this _Section
5.15(b)_ shall require any cooperation to the extent that it would (A) require
any Newpark Entity or any Transferred Entity, as applicable, to waive or amend
any terms of this Agreement, agree to pay any commitment, financing or other
fees or reimburse any expenses with respect to the Financing or (B) require
any Transferred Entity to take any action with respect to the Financing that
is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement).
Buyer shall, upon request by Newpark, promptly reimburse Newpark for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorney's fees) incurred by any Newpark Entity or
Transferred Entity in connection with the cooperation contemplated by clause
(ii) of this _Section 5.15(b)_ and shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Newpark Entity, each Transferred Entity and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, Affiliates and representatives from and against
any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in
connection with the arrangement or consummation of the Financing except with
respect to any such Damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such indemnified party.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.16 _Insurance_ _._ Notwithstanding the fact that insurance
coverage for the Transferred Entities and the Business under insurance
policies of Newpark and its Affiliates shall terminate as of the Closing,
following the Closing, the Transferred Entities may bring claims under and
against all such policies that are occurrence-based (rather than claim-based)
policies if the events underlying such claims occurred prior to the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Litigation Support_ _._ After the Closing, in the event
and for so long as either Party actively is contesting or defending against
any Legal Proceeding in connection with any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving any
of the Transferred Entities, the other Party will reasonably cooperate with
the contesting or defending Party and its counsel in the contest, make
available their personnel and provide such testimony and access to their books
and records as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or
defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party
(unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under _ARTICLE VIII_ ).

 



 

Section 5.18 _Confidentiality_. After the Closing, the Newpark Entities
and their Affiliates shall treat and hold as confidential all information
concerning the Business and the Transferred Entities that is not already
generally available to the public ("Confidential Information") and refrain
from using any of the Confidential Information in a manner that would violate
the provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_. In the event that any Newpark Entity or
any of their respective Affiliates is requested or required by oral question
or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process to
disclose any Confidential Information, such Newpark Entity or Affiliates will
notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 5.18_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, such Newpark Entity or Affiliate is legally required to
disclose any Confidential Information, it may disclose the required
Confidential Information to the requesting authority; _provided, however_ ,
that such Newpark Entity or Affiliate shall, at the Buyer's expense, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of Buyer,
an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to
such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Accounts Receivable_. No later than two Business Days prior
to Closing, Newpark shall deliver _Schedule 5.19_, which shall set forth a
complete and correct list of all accounts receivable included in the
calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital (the "Closing Date
Receivables"). The list of the Closing Date Receivables may be revised in
connection with the determination of the Final Net Working Capital. Buyer
shall cause the Transferred Entities to use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect the Closing Date Receivables for a period of not less than one hundred
twenty (120) days after the Closing Date. If collections by the Transferred
Entities with respect to the Closing Date Receivables during the one hundred
twenty (120) day period following the Closing Date are less than the amount of
the Closing Date Receivables (such deficit being referred to as the
"Uncollected Receivables Amount"), the Newpark Entities shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the Uncollected Receivables Amount within ten (10) days of
written demand by Buyer. Buyer's right to recover the Uncollected Receivables
Amount from the Newpark Entities shall not be subject to the provisions of
_ARTICLE VIII_ or the Cap, Basket or any other limitations of liability set
forth therein. Any such payment shall be deemed an adjustment to the Purchase
Price. Subject to the final sentence of this _Section 5.19_ , upon receiving
payment for the Uncollected Receivables Amount, Buyer shall cause the
Transferred Entities to assign such uncollected Closing Date Receivables to
the Newpark Entities. If Buyer or any Transferred Entity thereafter receives
payment on any such uncollected Closing Date Receivables for which Buyer has
previously received payment pursuant to this _Section 5.19_ , Buyer shall
promptly pay to the Newpark Entities the amount received by Buyer or any
Transferred Entity for such uncollected Closing Date Receivable. Upon
assignment of any such uncollected Closing Date Receivables to the Newpark
Entities, the Newpark Entities shall have the right to seek collection of any
such Closing Date Receivables. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 5.19_ , if Buyer does not wish to assign to the Newpark Entities
any (or all) of the uncollected Closing Date Receivables, it may elect to not
do so, in which case the Newpark Entities will not be required to pay Buyer
for such (but only such) uncollected Closing Date Receivables that are not
assigned.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.20 _Financial Assurances_. No later than one (1) Business Day
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense, submit
filings with the appropriate Governmental Entities regarding the substitution
of Financial Assurances obtained by Buyer for all Newpark Financial Assurances
identified on _Schedule 3.5(i)_. Such substitution shall include the
assumption by Buyer or the Transferred Entities of, and the full and complete
release of all Newpark Entities and their Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Entities) under, all Newpark Financial Assurances and any
underlying credit support obligations and shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Newpark Entities. The Newpark Entities shall
cooperate with Buyer in good faith in preparing and making all such filings.

 



 

Section 5.21 _Mississippi Real Property Option_.

 



 

(a) At Closing, Newpark shall grant Buyer the exclusive option to purchase
(the "Mississippi Real Property Option"), on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this _Section 5.21_ , from NES Mississippi (or any
other applicable Affiliate of Newpark), at a price of one dollar ($1.00) (the
"Option Price"), the real property more particularly described on _Schedule
5.21(a)_ (the "Mississippi Real Property"). Newpark shall deliver to Buyer at
Closing a recordable instrument containing the Mississippi Real Property
Option in a form mutually agreed to by Buyer and Newpark, incorporating the
terms and conditions of this _Section 5.21_ and meeting the requirements of
Mississippi law. Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
exercise the Mississippi Real Property Option in its sole discretion by giving
written notice to Newpark (the "Option Notice") at any time during the twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date (the "Option Period").

 



 

(b) Buyer may, in its sole discretion, elect to terminate the Mississippi
Real Property Option by written notice to Newpark any time prior to the
expiration of the Option Period and in such event shall have no obligation or
Liability whatsoever relating to or arising out of the Mississippi Real
Property Option. If Buyer delivers the Option Notice to Newpark, but fails,
for any reason, to consummate the Mississippi Real Property Option on or prior
to the Option Closing Date determined in accordance with _Section 5.21(c)_ ,
then the Mississippi Real Property Option will be deemed to have terminated on
such Option Closing Date.

 



 

(c) The closing of the purchase of the Mississippi Real Property pursuant
to the Mississippi Real Property Option (the "Option Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Newpark on a date mutually agreed to by Buyer and
Newpark, which date (the "Option Closing Date") shall be as promptly as
practicable following delivery of the Option Notice and, unless otherwise
mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Newpark, shall be not later than 90 calendar
days after the date the Option Notice is received by Newpark. At the Option
Closing, (i) NES Mississippi shall (or Newpark shall cause any other
applicable Affiliate of Newpark to) deliver to Buyer (or any other designated
Affiliate of Buyer) a special warranty deed in a form mutually acceptable to
NES Mississippi and Buyer conveying the Mississippi Real Property to Buyer or
its designated Affiliate in exchange for payment of the Option Price. The
Mississippi Real Property shall be conveyed subject to all restrictions,
reservations, encumbrances, easements, rights-of-way, outstanding royalty and
mineral interests, covenants, conditions, physical encroachments or overlaps
and other matters relating to the Mississippi Real Property as reflected in
the Official Public Records of Real Property of Quitman County, Mississippi,
or as would be revealed by a true and correct survey of the Mississippi Real
Property or physical inspection thereof.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) In the event that Buyer elects to exercise the Mississippi Real
Property Option, Newpark, NES Mississippi (or any other Affiliate of Newpark
transferring the Mississippi Real Property) shall as of the Option Closing
Date, on a joint and several basis: (i) represent and warrant to Buyer in a
writing acceptable to Buyer (A) that the transferor has good and marketable
title to the Mississippi Real Property, free and clear of all Liens, other
than Permitted Liens, and such other matters as provided in _Section 5.21(c)_
above, and (B) that such transferor has full power, authority and legal
capacity to transfer the Mississippi Real Property.

 



 

(e) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Option
Closing or the expiration of the Option Period, without the prior written
consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), Newpark shall not cause, authorize or permit NES Mississippi to sell
or transfer the Mississippi Real Property. During the Option Period, Newpark
shall cooperate with Buyer to allow Buyer to update its evaluation of the
Mississippi Real Property, including providing Buyer reasonable access to the
Mississippi Real Property, and provide Buyer copies of any documents or
reports held by Newpark regarding the Mississippi Real Property.

 



 

Section 5.22 _Bayou Choctaw Option_.

 



 

(a) At Closing, Newpark shall grant Buyer the exclusive option to purchase
(the "Bayou Choctaw Option"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this _Section 5.22_ , from Newpark (or any other applicable Affiliate
of Newpark), at a price of one dollar ($1.00) (the "BC Option Price"), all
mineral rights reserved by NES in that certain Cash Sale more particularly
described in item 9.f. of _Schedule 3.9(a)_ (the "BC Mineral Estate"). If
necessary, Newpark shall deliver to Buyer at Closing a recordable instrument
containing the Bayou Choctaw Option in a form mutually agreed to by Buyer and
Newpark, incorporating the terms and conditions of this _Section 5.22_ and
meeting the requirements of Louisiana law. Buyer shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to exercise the Bayou Choctaw Option in its sole discretion by
giving written notice to Newpark (the "BC Option Notice") at any time during
the twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the "BC Option Period").

 



 

(b) Buyer may, in its sole discretion, elect to terminate Bayou Choctaw
Option by written notice to Newpark any time prior to the expiration of the BC
Option Period and in such event shall have no obligation or Liability
whatsoever relating to or arising out of the Bayou Choctaw Option. If Buyer
delivers the BC Option Notice to Newpark, but fails, for any reason, to
consummate the Bayou Choctaw Option on or prior to the BC Option Closing Date
determined in accordance with _Section 5.22(c)_ , then the Bayou Choctaw
Option will be deemed to have terminated on such BC Option Closing Date.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) The closing of the purchase of the BC Mineral Estate pursuant to the
Bayou Choctaw Option (the "BC Option Closing") shall take place at the offices
of Newpark on a date mutually agreed to by Buyer and Newpark, which date (the
"BC Option Closing Date") shall be as promptly as practicable following
delivery of the BC Option Notice and, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by
Buyer and Newpark, shall be not later than 90 calendar days after the date the
BC Option Notice is received by Newpark. At the BC Option Closing, (i) Newpark
shall (or Newpark shall cause any other applicable Affiliate of Newpark to)
deliver to Buyer (or any other designated Affiliate of Buyer) an assignment in
a form mutually acceptable to Newpark and Buyer conveying the BC Mineral
Estate to Buyer or its designated Affiliate in exchange for payment of the BC
Option Price. The BC Mineral Estate shall be conveyed subject to all
restrictions, reservations, encumbrances, easements, rights-of-way,
outstanding royalty and mineral interests, covenants, conditions, physical
encroachments or overlaps and other matters relating to the BC Mineral Estate
as reflected in the Official Public Records of Real Property of West Baton
Rouge Parish, Louisiana.

Newpark, or any other Affiliate of Newpark transferring the BC Mineral Estate
shall as of the BC Option Closing Date, on a joint and several basis: (i)
represent and warrant to Buyer in a writing acceptable to Buyer (A) that the
transferor has good and marketable title to the BC Mineral Estate, free and
clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens, and such other matters as
provided in _Section 5.22(c)_ above, and (B) that such transferor has full
power, authority and legal capacity to transfer the BC Mineral Estate.

 



 

(e) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the BC Option
Closing or the expiration of the BC Option Period, without the prior written
consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), Newpark shall not, except as provided in _Section 7.2(f)_ , cause or
authorize any sale or transfer of the BC Mineral Estate, or any royalty or
other interest related thereto, nor enter into any mineral lease or other
agreement granting rights to the BC Mineral Estate. During the BC Option
Period, Newpark shall cooperate with Buyer to allow Buyer to update its
evaluation of the BC Mineral Estate, including providing Buyer reasonable
access to the BC Mineral Estate, and provide Buyer copies of any documents or

Section 6.1 _Employees and Compensation_.

 



 

(a) Newpark shall update _Schedule 3.11(a)_ as of two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date to reflect the Employees and Transferred Employees
as of the Closing Date. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, copies of
all personnel records maintained by the Newpark Entities and their Affiliates
with respect to Transferred Employees shall be provided to Buyer promptly
after Closing.

 



 

(b) Subject to any Actively at Work requirements under or related to any
Buyer Benefit Plans, from the Closing Date through the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the Transferred Entities
to provide, the Transferred Employees with: (i) base salary or hourly wages
that are substantially similar to the base salary or hourly wages provided by
Newpark and its Affiliates as of the date of this Agreement; (ii) target bonus
opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), if any, that are
substantially similar to the target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-
based compensation) provided by Newpark and its Affiliates as of the date of
this Agreement or, to the extent such bonus opportunities have not been
established for the 2014 calendar year, the target bonus opportunities that
were made available for the 2013 calendar year; and (iii) retirement and
welfare benefits that are substantially similar, as to the nature of the
benefits being provided, to those provided by Newpark and its Affiliates as of
the date of this Agreement. Nothing in the foregoing provision or otherwise
shall in any way alter the "at will" nature of the employment relationship
between any Transferred Employee, on the one hand, and any Transferred Entity,
on the other hand, and the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.1(b)_ will
not apply with respect to immaterial unwritten employee benefit plans or
arrangements nor to any Transferred Employees with respect to any period after
termination of such Transferred Employee's employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 6.2 _Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) As of the Closing Date and to the extent permitted by applicable Law
and under the applicable Benefit Plans (and specifically subject to any
Actively at Work requirements), Buyer shall permit each Transferred Employee
to enroll in the Benefit Plans provided by Buyer or its Affiliates to their
employees on the Closing Date (collectively, the "Buyer Benefit Plans") that
are consistent with the requirements set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_. With
respect to any Buyer Benefit Plan in which any Transferred Employee will
participate effective as of or following the Closing Date, (i) each such
employee's credited service with Newpark and its Affiliates shall be credited
against any waiting period applicable to eligibility for enrollment of new
employees under the Buyer Benefit Plans, but shall not apply in determining
whether such employee has satisfied any Actively at Work requirements; and
(ii) limitations on benefits due to pre-existing conditions shall be waived
(or, if such a waiver is not otherwise required by applicable Laws, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have them waived), to the extent
waived under the corresponding Transferred Entities Benefit Plans for any
Transferred Employee enrolled in any group health plan maintained by Newpark
and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for providing the notices and making
available continuation coverage as required by COBRA for each Transferred
Employee and his or her covered dependents whose qualifying event (as defined

all of the former employees and their respective covered dependents whose
qualifying event (as defined in Code Section 4980B) occurs with respect to a
group health plan of Newpark of its Affiliates.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the
Closing Newpark and its Affiliates shall remain responsible for, and shall
retain all liabilities with respect to, the provision of benefits (including
disability benefits) under the Transferred Entities Benefit Plans, to (and
with respect to) any Employee who, at the time of the Closing, is disabled
(within the meaning of the applicable Transferred Entities Benefit Plan that
provides short or long-term disability benefits) or otherwise on an approved
leave of absence from the Transferred Entities as of the Closing. Such
Employees shall not be deemed to be Transferred Employees; provided, however,
that from and after the Closing Date, any right to return to work for any such
Employees shall be the obligation of Buyer and its Affiliates and not of
Newpark and its Affiliates. A list of such Employees shall be provided to
Buyer as of two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, (i) Buyer shall assume and honor or
shall cause the Transferred Entities to assume and honor, all unpaid vacation
or other paid time off days of the Transferred Employees that accrued or were
granted prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) Buyer shall sponsor a vacation
and paid time off policy that applies to each Transferred Employee and shall
take into account service with Newpark and its Affiliates as provided in
_Section 6.3(a)_. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no
event more than seven days after the Closing Date, Newpark shall provide Buyer
with the number of hours of accrued or granted but unpaid vacation and other
paid time off to which each Transferred Employee is entitled as of the Closing
Date.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall cause the
Transferred Employees to be eligible to participate under one or more flexible
spending account arrangements maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates
that provide such Transferred Employees with dependent care and medical
reimbursement benefits (collectively, the "Buyer Flex Plans"), (ii) Newpark
and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith so that the account balances under the
Transferred Entity Benefit Plans that constitute flexible spending account
arrangements of Newpark and its Affiliates (the "Newpark Flex Plans") of each
such Transferred Employee who has elected to participate therein in the 2014
calendar year shall be transferred, as soon as practicable (but in no event
more than ninety (90) days) after the Closing Date, from the Newpark Flex
Plans to the Buyer Flex Plans, and so that the contribution elections of each
such Transferred Employee as in effect as of the Closing Date remain in effect
under the Buyer Flex Plans immediately after the transfer of such account
balances, and (iii) (A) if the aggregate amount of the transferred account
balances of such Transferred Employees is negative, then Buyer shall pay
Newpark the amount of such aggregate negative balance promptly following such
account balance transfer and (B) if the aggregate amount of the transferred
account balances of such Transferred Employees is positive, then Newpark shall
pay Buyer the amount of such aggregate positive balance promptly following
such account balance transfer.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall, within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, pay to
the Newpark Entities a pro rata amount of any contributions made by the
Newpark Entities to the health savings accounts of any Transferred Employees
during the 2014 calendar year and prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) Newpark shall take or cause to be taken such actions as are necessary
and appropriate to ensure that as of the Closing Date, (i) none of the
Transferred Entities shall be a sponsoring, adopting or participating employer
of any Transferred Entities Benefit Plan identified on _Schedule 3.12(a)_ as a
Newpark Retained Plan, and (ii) one or more Transferred Entities, and no
Newpark Entity, shall be a sponsoring, adopting or participating employer of
each Transferred Entities Benefit Plan identified on _Schedule 3.12(a)_ as a
Transferred Plan.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Miscellaneous Employee Issues_.

 



 

(a) For eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for purposes of
determining whether any Transferred Employee has satisfied any Actively at
Work requirements) under the Buyer Benefit Plans providing benefits to any
Transferred Employee after the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee shall
be credited with all years of service for which such Transferred Employee was
credited before the Effective Time under any similar employee benefit plans,
practices or arrangements of Newpark and its Affiliates, unless providing
credit for such service would result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(b) No provision of this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to any
Benefit Plan nor create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) or any other persons
in respect of continued employment with any of the Newpark Entities, Buyer or
the Transferred Entities or any of their respective Affiliates or otherwise,
and no provision of this Agreement shall create any such rights in any such
persons with respect to any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any Benefit Plan which may be established or maintained by
the Newpark Entities, the Transferred Entities or Buyer.

which event the Newpark Entities shall be required to pay and be liable for
Buyer Damages in excess of the Basket; _provided_ , that the Basket shall not
apply with respect to any breach of any of the Fundamental Representations and
Warranties or the representations and warranties of Newpark set forth in

Buyer Indemnitee (net of reasonable costs and expenses incurred, whether
directly or indirectly, by such Buyer Indemnitee in connection with the
receipt of such amount), and any such amount actually received shall not be
counted toward the Basket.

 



 



 

 



   



 

In addition to the exceptions set forth above, the Basket and Cap shall not

contained in _ARTICLE IV_ of this Agreement or in the Buyer Closing
Certificate as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as if
such representation was made on and as of the Closing Date (except for
representations and warranties that expressly address matters only as of

(iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
materiality qualifications (whether by reference to "material", "all material

Damages caused by, arising out of, resulting from or relating to a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Buyer under this
Agreement, _provided_ , that any such materiality qualifiers shall not be
disregarded for the purpose of determining under this _ARTICLE VIII_ , whether
any such breach has occurred; and

 



 

(iv) the amount of any Newpark Damages shall be reduced by any amount
actually received by a Newpark Indemnitee with respect thereto under any
insurance coverage with respect to, or from any third party alleged to be

realization of such amount. If a Newpark Indemnitee actually receives any

case arising out of or resulting from the assertion of liability or any Legal
Proceeding by third parties who are not Affiliated with a Party to this
Agreement (each, as the case may be, a "Third-Party Claim"), will be subject
to the terms and conditions of the following clauses (a) through (e):

 



 

(a) A party claiming indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified
Party") shall promptly after receiving written notice of any Third-Party
Claim, but in no event later than twenty (20) days thereafter, transmit to the
party or parties from whom indemnification is sought under this Agreement (the
"Indemnifying Party") a written notice of the Third-Party Claim (a "Claim
Notice") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third-Party Claim,
attaching a copy of all papers served to such Indemnified Party with respect
to such Third-Party Claim (if any), setting forth a reasonable estimate of the
amount of Damages attributable to the Third-Party Claim to the extent feasible
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of Damages arising
from or relating to such Third-Party Claim), and describing in reasonable
detail the basis of the Indemnified Party's request for indemnification under
this Agreement. Any failure or delay to provide such Claim Notice within such
specified time period shall not release or relieve the Indemnifying Party from
its liability under this _ARTICLE VIII_ or affect the right of an Indemnified
Party to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the
extent) the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure or
delay.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of any Claim Notice (the
"Election Period"), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party
(i) whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to the
Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE VIII_ with respect to such Third-Party
Claim and (ii) whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost and
expense and in accordance with _Section 8.4(c)_ , to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within such Election Period that the Indemnifying
Party disputes its potential liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim,
any liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim shall be deemed a
disputed liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 8.4(d)_ , if the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend, at its sole cost and expense, such
Third-Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings with counsel of its choosing
(but reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), which proceedings
shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion
or settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this
_Section 8.4_. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense
and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided,
however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party before entering into any compromise or settlement of
such Third-Party Claim or ceasing to defend such Third-Party Claim, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, _provided further,_ that no such
consent shall be required for any such compromise or settlement that: (A) is
exclusively monetary and will be paid in full by the Indemnifying Party
(rather than the Indemnified Party); (B) does not contain an admission of
liability on the part of any Indemnified Party; and (C) unconditionally and
fully releases the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.
If reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third-
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest in good faith
pursuant to this _Section 8.4(c)_ , including by providing the Indemnifying
Party with reasonable access during normal business hours of the Indemnified
Party to books, records and personnel of the Indemnified Party (but only to
the extent relevant to such Third-Party Claim), and in making any related
counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third-Party Claim or any cross-
complaint against any Person. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third-Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Section 8.4(c)_ , and to retain counsel of the Indemnified
Party's own choice in connection with such participation, and the Indemnified
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of the defense of
such Third-Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees, costs and expenses
of separate counsel retained by the Indemnified Party: (i) if the Indemnifying
Party fails to timely assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim pursuant to
_Section 8.4(b)_ ; (ii) if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such
Third-Party Claim but fails to diligently prosecute or defend the Legal
Proceeding related to such Third-Party Claim as herein provided; (iii) if such
Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party; or (iv) if the interests of the Indemnified Party conflict
with those of the Indemnifying Party so that it renders it inappropriate for
the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party. In the event any of the conditions in clauses (i) through (iv) is met,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third-Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings shall be diligently prosecuted by the
Indemnified Party to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
responsible for paying more than one separate firm of attorneys to represent
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof,
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability with respect to
any such settlement (i) without the Indemnifying Party's written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (ii) unless the Indemnifying
Party's liability with respect to such settlement is determined pursuant to a
Final Resolution. If reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party and its counsel
(including by providing the Indemnified Party with reasonable access during
normal business hours of the Indemnifying Party to books, records and
personnel of the Indemnifying Party (but only to the extent relevant to such
Third-Party Claim)) in defending such Third-Party Claim, in contesting any
Third-Party Claim that the Indemnified Party elects to contest in good faith,
and in making any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third-
Party Claim or any cross-complaint against any Person. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if within the Election Period the Indemnifying Party has delivered
a written notice to the Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnifying
Party disputes its potential liability to the Indemnified Party under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ with respect to such Third-Party Claim, or by the Indemnifying
Party's failure to respond, the Indemnifying Party is deemed to dispute its
potential liability, and if such dispute is finally and conclusively resolved
by a court of competent jurisdiction in favor of the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to bear the costs and expenses of the
Indemnified Party's defense of such Third-Party Claim pursuant to this
_Section 8.4(d)_ or of the Indemnifying Party's participation therein at the
Indemnified Party's request, and the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the
Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable attorney's fees and costs
actually paid by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such participation
within thirty (30) days of receiving an invoice and reasonably sufficient
supporting documentation therefor. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third-Party Claim controlled by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Section 8.4(d)_ , and to retain counsel of the Indemnifying
Party's own choice in connection with such participation, and the Indemnifying
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(e) The non-controlling party in the defense of a Third-Party Claim shall
have the right to consult with the party controlling such defense, and the
controlling party shall facilitate such consultation, with respect to the
conduct, status, developments and results of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim and the controlling party's strategy for addressing the matters that are
the basis of such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(f) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim for
indemnification hereunder against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve
a Third-Party Claim (an "Indemnity Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall
promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice of such Indemnity
Claim (an "Indemnity Notice") describing in reasonable detail the nature of
the Indemnity Claim, and setting forth a reasonable estimate of the amount of
Damages attributable to such Indemnity Claim to the extent feasible (which
estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of Damages arising from
or relating to such Indemnity Claim) and the basis of the Indemnified Party's
request for indemnification under this Agreement. Any failure or delay to
provide such Indemnity Notice shall not release or relieve the Indemnifying
Party from its liability under this _ARTICLE VIII_ or affect the right of an
Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent (and only
to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure
or delay.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(g) Within twenty (20) days after receipt of any Indemnity Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying
Party disputes its potential liability to the Indemnified Party under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ with respect to such Indemnity Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
does not notify the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days from its receipt
of the Indemnity Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such Indemnity
Claim, any liability with respect to such Indemnity Claim shall be deemed a
disputed liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Manner and Timing of Payment_. Any indemnification of the
Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ or _Section 5.9_ shall be
paid, no later than ten (10) days following the Final Resolution thereof, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Newpark Entities to an
account or accounts designated by the applicable Buyer Indemnitees in writing.
Any indemnification of the Newpark Indemnitees pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_
or _Section 5.9_ shall be paid, no later than ten (10) days following the
Final Resolution thereof, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from
Buyer to an account or accounts designated by the applicable Newpark
Indemnitees in writing.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Effect of Investigation_. The right to indemnification,
payment of any Damages or other remedy under this Agreement based on a breach
of any of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Any indemnification payment
pursuant to _Section 5.9_ or this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 



 

Section 8.8 _No Duplication_. Any Damages giving rise to liability for
indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery
by reason of the same set of facts giving rise to such Damages constituting a
breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Limitation On Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL,
PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECULATIVE OR INDIRECT
DAMAGES, ANY LOSS OF FUTURE REVENUE, INCOME OR LOST PROFITS, DIMINUTION IN
VALUE, DAMAGE TO REPUTATION OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT,
TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE AND NO "MULTIPLE OF PROFITS" OR "MULTIPLE
OF CASH FLOW" OR SIMILAR METHODOLOGY SHALL BE USED IN CALCULATING THE AMOUNT
OF ANY DAMAGES; _PROVIDED, HOWEVER_ , THAT THIS _Section_ _8.9_ SHALL NOT
LIMIT A PARTY'S RIGHT TO RECOVER ANY SUCH DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH
PARTY IS REQUIRED TO PAY SUCH DAMAGES TO A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A
MATTER FOR WHICH SUCH PARTY IS OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION PURSUANT
TO THIS _ARTICLE VIII_.

PARTY'S RIGHTS UNDER _Section_ _2.4_ OR _Section_ _11.12_ , THE PROVISIONS SET
FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE VIII_ AND _Section 5.9(_ _f)_ AND _Section 5.9(_ _g)_
SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS AND REMEDIES OF THE
PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM FOR, RELATED TO OR ARISING FROM ANY BREACH
OF OR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CLAIM RELATED TO OR ARISING
FROM THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 **ARTICLE IX ** _ 

TERMINATION_

 



 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section
9.1_ , this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Newpark and Buyer;

 



 

(b) by Buyer by written notice to Newpark if:

 



 

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by any
Newpark Entity pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure
of any of the conditions specified in _ARTICLE VII_ and such breach,
inaccuracy or failure cannot be cured by the Newpark Entities by March 31,
2014 (the "Termination Date"); or

 



 

(ii) Newpark shall not have filed with the DOJ and FTC on or before the
date which is seven (7) days following the date of this Agreement, the
notification and report form required to be filed by Newpark for the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the HSR Act.

 



 

(c) by Newpark by written notice to Buyer:

 



 

(i) if none of the Newpark Entities is then in material breach of any
provision of this Agreement and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy
in or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure
of any of the conditions specified in _ARTICLE VII_ and such breach,
inaccuracy or failure cannot be cured by Buyer by the Termination Date;

 



 

(ii) if Buyer shall not have filed with the DOJ and FTC on or before the
date which is seven (7) days following the date of this Agreement, the
notification and report form required to be filed by Buyer for the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the HSR Act; or

 



 

(iii) at any time after the Financing Date, if the conditions to the
Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ are satisfied as of the
Financing Date (other than any condition the failure of which to be satisfied
is primarily attributable to a breach by Buyer of its representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein and other than those
conditions capable of being satisfied only at Closing, each of which is
capable of being satisfied, or waived by Newpark, at the Closing) and Buyer is
unable to satisfy its obligation to effect the Closing at such time as
contemplated in _Section 2.3_ or such later time as agreed to by Newpark,
because Buyer has failed to receive the proceeds from the Financing or any
alternative financing.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) by Buyer or Newpark in the event that:

 



 

(i) a Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action, in each case, restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 9.1(d)(i)_ shall not be available to any Party who did not use
commercially reasonable efforts to lift any such order, decree or ruling or
other action or whose failure to comply with _Section 5.3_ has been the
primary cause of such order, decree, ruling or other action; or

 



 

(ii) the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Termination
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that either Newpark or Buyer may, at its sole
discretion, extend the Termination Date on one or more occasions for an
aggregate period not to exceed forty-five (45) days if all other conditions to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are satisfied
or capable of then being satisfied, and the sole reason that such transactions
have not been consummated by such date is that the condition set forth in
_Section 7.1(a)_ has not been satisfied; _provided, that_ the extension may be
increased to a period not to exceed seventy-five (75) days if a Divestiture is
required and any dispute with respect to the Agreed Value is submitted to an
Accounting Arbitrator or a valuation expert in accordance with _Section
5.3(e)_ , _provided, further,_ that the Termination Date shall not be extended
hereunder for a period in excess of five (5) Business Days following the later
to occur of the date upon which HSR Approval shall have been received, or the
date upon which a determination of the Agreed Value is made. The right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to comply or perform in any material
respect with such Party's representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in
the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on or
before the Termination Date.

 



 

(e) by Buyer pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)(iii)_ or _(iv)_.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Notice of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by Newpark, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, pursuant
to _Section 9.1_ , written notice of such termination shall be given by the
terminating Party to the other Parties to this Agreement on or before the
applicable date set forth in _Section 9.1_ or if no date is set forth, on or
before the Termination Date (as it may be extended).

 



 

Section 9.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by Newpark, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, pursuant
to _Section 9.1_ , this Agreement shall terminate and become void and have no
effect, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be abandoned
without further action by the Parties to this Agreement, except that the
provisions of _Section 5.1(a)_ (as they relate to the Confidentiality
Agreement), _Section 5.1(c)_ , _Section 8.9_ , this _Section 9.3_ , _Section
11.5_ and _Section 11.8_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that such termination shall not relieve any Party to
this Agreement of any liability for breach of this Agreement and the
terminating Party's right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such
termination.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if this
Agreement is validly terminated by Newpark pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(iii)_ ,
then Buyer shall pay to Newpark the sum of $5,000,000 (the "Reverse
Termination Fee"), as liquidated damages, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified in writing by Newpark, such payment to
be made within five Business Days of delivery of notice of such termination.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(iii)_ , Newpark's damages would be difficult or
impossible to quantify with reasonable certainty, and accordingly the payment
of the Reverse Termination Fee provided for in this _Section 9.3(a)_ is a
payment of liquidated damages (and not penalties) which is based upon the
Parties' estimate of the damages Newpark will suffer or incur as a result of
the event giving rise to such payment and the resulting termination of this
Agreement, and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee by Buyer as herein
provided shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Newpark in the event of any
such termination.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) In the event the Reverse Termination Fee is paid to Newpark pursuant
to _Section 9.3(a)_ , __ (i) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates,
representatives or lenders shall have any further liability with respect to
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any written or oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, to Newpark or its stockholders, the other Newpark Entities, the
Transferred Entities, their respective Affiliates or any other Person, (ii) no
Person shall have any rights or claims against Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
representatives or lenders relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and (iii) none of the Newpark Entities, the Transferred Entities or
any other Person acting on behalf thereof, shall seek to recover money damages
(other than the Reverse Termination Fee) or seek any other remedy, including
specific performance, with respect to the failure of the Closing to occur. In
no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated other than by Newpark
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(iii)_ , the Reverse Termination Fee shall not be
payable to Newpark.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X ** _ 

ESCROW_

 



 

Section 10.1 _Escrow Fund_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent in
accordance with _Section 2.3(a)_ , the Escrow Amount (such funds, as held by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, including interest and
income thereon, the "Escrow Fund") and the Escrow Fund shall be held and
distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. In the event that any Buyer Indemnitees shall make a claim for
indemnification against any Newpark Entity pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_ , such
Buyer Indemnitee shall first seek recovery of any Buyer Damages from the
Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, to the extent funds are
available therein. The Escrow Fund shall not represent a cap on, or otherwise
limit the liabilities or obligations of the Newpark Entities with respect to
any Buyer Damages under _ARTICLE VIII_.

 



 

(b) The Escrow Fund shall be maintained in the escrow account established
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund, subject to the provisions
of this _ARTICLE X_ and the Escrow Agreement, shall be maintained in the
escrow account until the Escrow Release Date.

 



 

(c) On the Escrow Interim Release Date, and subject to the terms of this
_ARTICLE X_ and the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Newpark, or its designee, an amount equal to the lesser of:
(i) fifty percent (50%) of the original Escrow Amount, or (ii) the remaining
funds, if any, held in the Escrow Account in excess of fifty percent (50%) of
the original Escrow Amount, unless prior to the Escrow Interim Release Date
Buyer provides to the Escrow Agent and Newpark a Claim Notice or an Indemnity
Notice. Any such notice shall set forth the total estimated amount (if such
estimate is reasonably determinable) of the pending Third-Party Claim(s) and
Indemnity Claims(s). If any such Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice is received
by the Escrow Agent and not resolved prior to the Escrow Interim Release Date,
the Escrow Agent shall release, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, only
that part of the Escrow Amount that is eligible to be released pursuant to the
preceding sentence that exceeds the estimated amount of any unresolved Third-
Party Claim(s) or Indemnity Claim(s), with the remaining funds that would have
been so released to be held in the Escrow Account until such claim(s) are
resolved.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) On the Escrow Final Release Date, subject to the terms of this
_ARTICLE X_ and the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Newpark, or its designee, the balance, if any, of the
Escrow Fund, unless prior to the Escrow Final Release Date Buyer provides the
Escrow Agent and Newpark a Claim Notice or an Indemnity Notice. Any such
notice shall set forth the total estimated amount (if such estimate is
reasonably determinable) of the pending Third-Party Claim(s) and Indemnity
Claim(s). If any such Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice is received by the
Escrow Agent and such claim is pending or not resolved prior to the Escrow
Final Release Date, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the Escrow Account an
amount equal to the estimated amount of the pending and unresolved claim(s),
as set forth in the Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice (the "Retained Escrow
Amount"), and release to Newpark any amount in the Escrow Account in excess of
the Retained Escrow Amount. The Retained Escrow Amount shall be distributed in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this _ARTICLE X_ and the Escrow
Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Release From Escrow_. When either Newpark, on the one hand,
or Buyer, on the other hand, become entitled, under this ARTICLE X and the
Escrow Agreement, to any distribution of all or any portion of the Escrow
Fund, Newpark and Buyer shall promptly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
joint written instructions setting forth the amounts to be paid to such Party
from the Escrow Fund (the "Joint Indemnity Instructions"). In furtherance, and
not in limitation, of the foregoing:

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees to execute and deliver and Newpark agrees to execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent the Joint Indemnity Instructions within two (2)
Business Days of any Final Resolution that any Party is entitled to a
distribution of all or any portion of the Escrow Fund pursuant to _ARTICLE
VIII_ , instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute such portion of the Escrow
Fund in accordance with such Final Resolution; and

 



 

(b) If Buyer shall fail to execute and deliver or if Newpark shall fail to
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent the Joint Indemnity Instructions in
accordance with _Section 10.2(a)_ , either Newpark or Buyer, as applicable,
shall be entitled to receive distributions from the Escrow Fund from the
Escrow Agent promptly upon delivery to the Escrow Agent of a final written
non-appealable instruction, order or judgment (setting forth the amounts to be
paid to such Party) issued or entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI ** _ 

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

 



 

Section 11.1 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time by the Parties to this Agreement only by
an instrument in writing signed by all Parties; _provided_ , that _Section
11.14_ may be amended, modified or supplemented only by an instrument in
writing signed by all Parties and each lender (including the Lender) under the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter (each, a "Lender Party").

 



 

Section 11.2 _Entire Agreement; Assignment; Binding Effect_. This
Agreement, together with the Disclosure Schedules, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Transaction Documents and all Exhibits hereto, (a) constitutes
the entire agreement among the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof
and supersedes other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the Parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and
(b) shall not be assigned, by operation of Law or otherwise, by a Party,
without the prior written consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the
preceding clause (b) to the contrary, Buyer in its sole discretion, and
without the consent of any of the Newpark Entities, may (i) assign in whole or
in part its rights under this Agreement for collateral security purposes to
the Lender or any other lenders providing financing to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, and any such lender may exercise all of the rights and remedies of
Buyer hereunder, (ii) assign in whole or in part Buyer's rights under this
Agreement to any one or more Affiliate of Buyer and (iii) after the Closing,
assign in whole or in part Buyer's rights under this Agreement in connection
with any disposition or transfer of all or any portion of any of the
Transferred Entities or any of their respective assets, liabilities or
businesses in any form of transaction; _provided_ , that any such assignment
shall not relieve Buyer of any liability or obligation under this Agreement.
Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 11.3 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broadly as is
enforceable.

Agreement shall be in writing and may be given by any of the following

Section 11.5 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and any controversy or Legal Proceeding related to or
arising, directly or indirectly, out of, caused by or resulting from this
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed
entirely within that state. All actions and proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in any Texas state or
federal court sitting in Houston, Texas, and the Parties hereby irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or
proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any such action or proceeding. Each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to the service of any and all process in any such
action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process to such Party at
its address specified in _Section 11.4_. The Parties agree that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law. Nothing in this _Section 11.5_ shall affect the
right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Each Party hereby expressly, unconditionally and irrevocably waives to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect to any proceeding directly or indirectly arising out
of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each Party (i) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
other Party would not, in the event of such proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other Parties have been
induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this section.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 11.6 _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings used in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no
way be construed to define, limit, describe, explain, modify, amplify, or add
to the interpretation, construction or meaning of any provision of, or scope
or intent of, this Agreement nor in any way affect this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. An executed counterpart
signature page to this Agreement delivered by facsimile or other means of
electronic transmission shall be deemed to be an original and shall be as
effective for all purposes as delivery of a manually executed counterpart.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, and except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, all costs and expenses (including legal
and financial advisory fees and expenses) incurred in connection with, or in
anticipation of, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses; _provided_ ,
that Newpark shall be responsible for, and shall pay, all Transaction
Expenses.

 



 

Section 11.9 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Subject to _Section 11.14_ ,
this Agreement is (i) solely for the benefit of the Newpark Entities and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and the Newpark Indemnitees, with
respect to the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, and (ii) solely for
the benefit of Buyer and its successors and permitted assigns and the Buyer
Indemnitees, with respect to the obligations of the Newpark Entities under
this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to confer upon or give
to any other third party any remedy, claim of liability or reimbursement,
cause of action or other right.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, no failure to exercise, delay in exercising, or single or partial
exercise of any right, power or remedy by any Party, and no course of dealing
between or among the Parties, shall constitute a waiver of any such right,
power or remedy. No waiver by a Party of any default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement, whether intentional or
not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any such prior or subsequent
occurrence. No waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the Party
against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Incorporation of Exhibits_. The Disclosure Schedules and
all exhibits attached hereto and referred to herein are hereby incorporated
herein and made a part hereof for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.
To the extent there is any inconsistency between such exhibits and this
Agreement, this Agreement shall control.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties to this Agreement agree
that, if at any time following the Closing, any covenants or agreements herein
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would
exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the Parties shall
be entitled to specific performance of such terms of this Agreement and
immediate injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy
of money damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. No party shall be entitled to specific
performance or other equitable relief prior to the Closing, and each Party
agrees that it shall not seek specific performance or any other equitable
relief prior to the Closing in respect of any matter related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including in respect of any Party's
failure to consummate such transactions for any reason whatsoever; _provided_
, that the foregoing shall not limit any Party's ability to seek damages or
other legal (non-equitable) remedies in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement for any breach of this Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 11.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. Anything disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedules with respect to any particular Section of this Agreement
shall be deemed disclosed with respect to another Section of this Agreement
only if it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is
applicable to such other Section. Inclusion of any item in the Disclosure
Schedules (a) does not represent a determination that such item is material
nor shall it be deemed to establish a standard of materiality, (b) does not
represent a determination by Newpark that such item did not arise in the
Ordinary Course of Business, and (c) shall not constitute, or be deemed to be,
an admission concerning such item by the Parties, except in the event that
such disclosure is responsive to an affirmative requirement in this Agreement
to disclose such item (and then only with respect to the Parties).

 



 

Section 11.14 _Certain Matters Relating to the Debt Financing_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of
the Parties: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in any
action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Lender Party, any Affiliate
thereof and their respective affiliates, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives involved
in the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter
(collectively, the "Financing Sources") in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in
any forum other than the federal and Texas state courts located in Houston,
Texas; (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing
Sources in any way relating to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules or
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) the Newpark
Entities, the Transferred Entities and their respective subsidiaries,
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members or stockholders shall not have any rights or claims against any
Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, except for any claim that may be asserted for a breach by any
Financing Source of the Confidentiality Agreement, and (b) no Financing Source
shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any of
the Newpark Entities, the Transferred Entities and their respective
subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any
Party under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, except for any liability arising out of any breach by any Financing
Source of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that after the Closing the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall not apply to the Transferred Entities or
any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders; provided
further, that nothing in this _Section 11.14_ shall abridge any right of Buyer
or Offshore Cleaning Systems, LLC under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to the protections of this _Section 11.14_.
