surrendered (or, if applicable, affidavits submitted) prior to the date that
is one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Effective Time, unclaimed
amounts (including interest thereon) of the Per Share Closing Common Stock
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation and may be commingled with the general
funds of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest.

complied with the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(f)_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as general
creditors thereof for payment for their claims in the form and amounts to

Escrow Amount to a segregated account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") and (ii) the
Indemnity Escrow Amount to a segregated account (the " _Indemnity Escrow
Account_ "), in each case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
be designated and administered by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. All costs, fees, charges and expenses assessed by the Escrow Agent
to maintain the Escrow Account and the Indemnity Escrow Account as required
hereunder, and any and all penalties, obligations and liabilities associated
therewith or arising therefrom (the " _Escrow Fees_ "), shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) Upon the expiration of the date that is fifteen (15) months following the
Closing Date (the " _Indemnity Escrow Release Date_ "), the funds remaining in
the Indemnity Escrow Amount as of such date shall be released to the
Representative for payment to each Stockholder of the Per Share Indemnity
Escrow Release Amount for each share of Common Stock held by such Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, less all applicable deductions and
withholding Taxes, no later than three (3) Business Days following the

_Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_.

 

SECTION 3.5 _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The Per Share

Options), and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further

holders of Options shall cease to have any rights with respect to Options,
except as otherwise expressly provided for herein or by applicable Law. If,

Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding is to be made
of the amounts subject to withholding, and (ii) provide such Person a
reasonable opportunity to deliver such forms, certificates or other evidence
as would eliminate or reduce any such required deduction or withholding. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and timely paid to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. The Company shall provide to Parent a
certification, dated as of the Closing Date and complying with Treasury

ARTICLE IV

 

DETERMINATION OF CLOSING MERGER CONSIDERATION AND POST-

 

CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS

 

SECTION 4.1 _Closing Estimates_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement
(the " _Estimated Statement_ ") reflecting the Companys good faith
calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration. In connection with
determining the Closing Merger Consideration, the Company shall estimate in
good faith the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment (the " _Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment_ "), Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated
Indebtedness_ "), Closing Cash (" _Estimated Cash_ "), and Closing
Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), which shall
be calculated on a basis consistent with this Agreement, including, as
applicable, _Exhibit A_.

 

SECTION 4.2 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to prepare and deliver to the Representative a statement (the "
_Post-Closing Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth the Surviving
Corporations calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration, including the
Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and
Closing Transaction Expenses, which shall be calculated on a basis consistent
with this Agreement, including, as applicable, _Exhibit_ __ _ A_.

 

(b) The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall, upon reasonable prior notice,
(i) permit the Representative and its representatives to have reasonable
access during normal business hours to the books, records and other documents
(including work papers, schedules, financial statements, memoranda, etc.,
subject to execution of customary work paper access letters if requested by
the accountants of the Surviving Corporation or Parent) and shall cooperate
with the Representative in seeking to obtain work papers from the Surviving
Corporation pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of the
Post-Closing Adjustment Statement and provide the Representative with copies
thereof (as reasonably requested by the Representative) and (ii) provide the
Representative and its representatives reasonable access to the employees and
accountants of Parent and its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by the
Representative. If the Representative disagrees with any part of the Surviving

 



18  Corporations calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash or Closing Transaction Expenses as set
forth on the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, the Representative shall,
within forty-five (45) days after the Representatives receipt of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement, notify Parent in writing of such disagreement
(an " _Objection Notice_ "). The Objection Notice shall specify which aspects
of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement are being disputed and describe the
basis for such dispute. If the Representative does not deliver an Objection
Notice within such forty-five (45) day period, then the Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement shall be conclusive, final and binding on all of the
parties (in such instance, a " _Final Statement_ "). If an Objection Notice is
delivered to Parent, then Parent and the Representative shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the computation of
the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and/or Closing Transaction Expenses, and any such resolution shall be
conclusive and binding on all of the parties (in such instance, a " _Final
Statement_ "). In the event that Parent and the Representative are unable to
resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after Parents receipt
of such Objection Notice, Parent or the Representative may submit such
remaining disagreements to a nationally recognized certified public accounting
firm as is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Representative (the "
_Accounting Firm_ "). 

(c) Parent and the Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm to
resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to the computation of the
Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and/or Closing Transaction Expenses identified in the Objection Notice as soon
as practicable, but in any event shall direct the Accounting Firm to render a
determination within thirty (30) days after its retention. The Accounting Firm
shall consider only those items and amounts in the Surviving Corporations and
the Representatives respective calculations of the Closing Net
Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Transaction Expenses that are identified as being items and amounts to which
Parent and the Representative have been unable to agree (it being understood
and agreed that all other items which are not the subject of objections in
the Objection Notice shall be conclusive, final and binding on all of the
parties). In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party. The Accounting Firms determination of the Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction
Expenses, as applicable, shall be based solely on written materials submitted
by Parent and the Representative ( _i.e._ , not on independent review) and on
the definitions set forth in this Agreement. The determination of
the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto
and shall not be subject to appeal or further review (other than with respect
to errors in arithmetic calculations) (in such instance, a " _Final Statement_
"). 

(d) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the
Surviving Corporation in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of
the items that are successfully disputed by the Representative (as finally
determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of the
items submitted to the Accounting Firm and by the Representative (which amount
shall be treated as a Representative Expense and paid from the Escrow Account
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.13_) in the proportion that the aggregate
dollar amount of the disputed items that are unsuccessfully disputed by
the Representative (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to
the aggregate dollar amount of the items submitted to the Accounting Firm.

 



19 (e) The Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses set forth on any Final Statement as
determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ shall be the " _Final
Net Working Capital Adjustment_ ", " _Final Indebtedness_ ", " _Final Closing
Cash_ " and " _Final Transaction Expenses_ ". For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Final Closing Merger Consideration_ " means, without duplication, (i) the
Enterprise Value, _less_  (ii) Final Indebtedness, _plus_ (iii) Final Closing
Cash, _less_ (iv) Final Transaction Expenses, _plus_ (v) the Final Net Working
Capital Adjustment, _less_ (vi) the Escrow Amount, _less_  (vii) the
Indemnity Escrow Amount. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount_ " means (x) the Final Closing Merger Consideration _less_
(y) the Closing Merger Consideration (which may be a positive or negative
number). Within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Merger
Consideration and the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount are finally determined
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.2_:

 

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is zero or a positive amount, (A)
Parent will promptly pay to, or at the direction of, the Representative, for
payment to the Stockholders, such positive amount by wire transfer or delivery
of other immediately available funds and (B) Parent and the Representative
shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release all
amounts remaining in the Escrow Account (less any Representative Expenses
incurred prior thereto) to, or at the direction of, the Representative, for
payment to the Stockholders, in each case, by wire transfer or delivery of
immediately available funds.

(ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, Parent and
the Representative will promptly provide joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to (A) pay to Parent an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the
absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount and (y) the amount in the
Escrow Account (less any Representative Expenses incurred prior thereto), and
(B) release all amounts remaining in the Escrow Account (less any
Representative Expenses incurred prior thereto) to, or at the direction of,
the Representative, for payment to the Stockholders, by wire transfer or
delivery of other immediately available funds. If the Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount is a negative amount and the absolute value of such amount is greater
than the amount in the Escrow Account (less any Representative Expenses
incurred prior thereto), Parent shall only be entitled to the amount in the
Escrow Account (less any Representative Expenses incurred prior thereto).

 

(iii) If the Stockholders are entitled to receive any payments under this
_Section_ __ _ 4.2_, the Representative shall distribute or direct to each
Stockholder the Per Share Escrow Release Amount and the Per Share Positive
Adjustment Amount for each share of Common Stock held by such Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case, less all applicable
deductions and withholding Taxes.

(iv) Any payment to be made to the Stockholders pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 4.2(e)_ shall be treated by all parties for tax purposes as additional
consideration, unless otherwise required under applicable Law.

copies of, as applicable (i) the plan document and all amendments thereto,
(ii) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 required to be filed with the
IRS (if any), (iii) the most recent summary plan description (if any), (iv)
the most recent IRS determination letter, and (v) each trust agreement and

to result in material Liability to the Company, the Company Benefit Plans are
all in compliance with their terms and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code and all other applicable Laws.

 

(b) To the Knowledge of the Company, (i) each Company Benefit Plan that is
intended to be tax qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code that is
sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is the
subject of a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to its
qualified status, and (ii) no event has occurred since the date of the
most recent determination letter or application therefor relating to any such
Company Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualification of such Company Benefit Plan, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

(c) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.13(c)_ , none of the Company Benefit
Plans provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any
Person, other than health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B
of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA.

 

(d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) all contributions, premiums
and benefit payments under or in connection with the Company Benefit Plans
that are required to have been made as of the date hereof in accordance with
the terms of the Company Benefit Plans have been timely made, and (ii) there
are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims (other
than routine claims for benefits) or Proceedings by a Governmental Body by, on
behalf of or against any Company Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto. 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is (i) an employee benefit plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii) a "multiemployer plan" (within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or (iii) a "multiple employer
welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA).

 

(f) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has (i) incurred or is
reasonably likely to incur any material liability under Title IV of ERISA
that has not been satisfied in full; or (ii) sponsored or contributed, (or had
any obligation to contribute) in the last six (6) years, to any plan that is
subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or any
"multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) in
the last six (6) years.

(g) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.13(g)_ , no Company Benefit Plan
exists that, as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, either alone or in combination with another event, would
(i) increase, or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any
forfeiture, payment or funding, of compensation or benefits under, or entitle
payment under or increase the amount payable pursuant to, any Company Benefit
Plan with respect to any current or former employee, director, officer or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii)
limit or restrict the right to merge, materially amend, terminate or transfer
the assets of any Company Benefit Plan on or following the Effective Time.

 



30 (h) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, as of the Closing, constitute an event under
any Company Benefit Plan resulting in the payment of any amount that may
reasonably be expected to constitute an "excess parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Code;  _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(h)_ if any amount (whether under any
Company Benefit Plan or otherwise) is deemed to constitute an "excess
parachute payment" as a result of any arrangement entered into with Parent.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to provide, and no
Company Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any individual with the right
to, a gross up for any excise or additional taxes, interest or penalties
incurred pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

(i) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, all Non-U.S. Company
Benefit Plans (i) are in compliance with their terms, applicable local Law,
taxation and funding requirements and (ii) to the extent intended to be
funded and/or book reserved, are funded and/or book reserved, as appropriated,
based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions. As of the date hereof, there is

the aggregate, reasonably be excepted to have a Material Adverse Effect.

subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated

SECTION 7.7 _Indemnification, Exculpation, Insurance and Release_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who
at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director, officer or manager of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each,
an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to
all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Proceeding
(whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted,
based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an
Indemnitee was a director, officer or manager of the Company or such
Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees
capacity as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of the Company or
such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, manager, employee, agent,
trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)),
in each case under clauses (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time as provided in (x) the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-
laws and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as currently in
effect and (y) the indemnification agreements listed on  _Schedule_ __ _
7.7_, which agreements shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation and the organizational
documents of its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors, officers
and managers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws and its
Subsidiaries organizational documents, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would in any material aspect
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) of any Indemnitee under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking in customary form to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Surviving Corporation under applicable Law.

 



43 (b) An Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and
control the defense of any Proceeding relating to any acts or omissions
covered under this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") with counsel
selected by the Indemnitee, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be permitted to
participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense. Each of Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in
the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and
individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

(c) For the six (6)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect the Companys and its Subsidiaries current directors and
officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and
any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
Companys and its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance
policy on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount,
not less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof (or Parent may substitute therefore policies, issued by
reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time). In no event will Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for each covered year an amount in
excess of 200% of the current annual premium for such insurance (the "
_Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage is terminated, cancelled,
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in
excess of the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will maintain such
insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of the six (6)-year period for
a premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium.

(d) Effective upon the Closing, the Company, for itself and on behalf of each
of its former, present and future Subsidiaries (each of the foregoing, a "
_Releasing Party_ "), hereby releases and forever discharges each Stockholder
and each other Person who is now, or who will have been at any time prior to
the Closing, an officer, director, stockholder, member or manager of the
Company or of any of its present or former Subsidiaries (or a fiduciary of any
employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its present or former
Subsidiaries), and each Person controlling any of the foregoing Persons (each
of the foregoing, a " _Released Party_ "), from any and all claims, rights,
obligations, debts, liabilities, actions or causes of action of every kind and
nature, whether foreseen or unforeseen, contingent or actual, and whether now
known or hereafter discovered, which any of the Releasing Parties had, now has
or may in the future have, at law or in equity, against any Released Party in
any way arising out of, in connection with, pertaining to or by reason of (i)
their respective status as such or (ii) any acts or omissions, or alleged acts
or omissions, by any of them in their respective capacities as such, which
acts or omissions existed or occurred at or prior to the Closing (each, a "
_Released Claim_ "), except for (A) claims involving criminal conduct, willful
misconduct or fraud or (B) claims under existing Contracts or commercial
relationships or arrangements, or this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Releasing Parties
hereby waive, and unconditionally release the Released Parties from, any
rights and remedies that the Releasing Parties may otherwise have against the
Released Parties under any Environmental Law, including, without limitation,
any claims for contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act or common law. Each of Parent and

 



44  Merger Sub hereby acknowledges the release by the Company and its
Subsidiaries set forth in the preceding sentences and covenants and agrees
that it will honor such release and will not, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries not to, take any action inconsistent
therewith (including commencing any Proceeding with respect to, or directly or
indirectly transferring to another Person, any Released Claim).

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnitee, each Released Party
and their respective heirs and representatives and (ii) in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Indemnitee or Released Party to whom this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ applies
unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(y) the affected Indemnitee or Released Party, as applicable, shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees and Released Parties to whom this _Section_ __ _
7.7_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_).

 

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation or the transferee of such properties and
assets shall expressly assume and be responsible for all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_.

SECTION 7.8 _Publicity_. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall issue any press release or public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
obtaining the prior written approval of the Representative (in the case of
Parent) or Parent (in the case of the Company), which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, unless, in the judgment of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, public disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by
the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Parent lists securities
(if any), provided that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the party
intending to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect
to the text thereof, it being understood and agreed that each party shall
promptly provide the other parties hereto with copies of any such release. The
Company and Parent agree that the initial press release to be issued in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in a form
mutually agreed.

SECTION 7.9 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent or one of its Affiliates shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed immediately prior to the
Closing Date and continue employment thereafter (the " _Company Employees_ ")
for the period of twelve (12) months immediately following the Closing
Date, (i) base salary or hourly wages that are no less favorable than those

 



45  in effect for each such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) entitlements under employee benefits and opportunities under
incentive plans, programs, contracts and arrangements that are no less
favorable than the employee benefit and incentive plans, programs, contracts
and arrangements (excluding stock-based compensation) provided by Parent or
one of its Affiliates, as applicable, to similarly situated employees of
Parent or one of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _that_ , to the extent any Company Employee is provided with
incentive opportunities and entitlements under employee benefits plans,
programs, contracts and arrangements that are substantially the same as those
provided to such Company Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing Date, such incentive opportunities and
entitlements will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this _clause (ii)_
, and (iii) severance benefits and entitlements no less favorable than those
for which similarly situated employees of Parent or one of its Affiliates, as
applicable, were eligible immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries to, recognize the service of the Company Employees with the

days as set forth in the Third Person Claim Notice as may be required by
court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the
Third Person Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified
Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third
Person Claim.

(b) In the event that the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third
Person Claim, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and absolute right after the
receipt of notice, at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by
counsel of its choice and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Third Person Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its
choice and at its expense; _provided_ _further_ ,  _however_ , that the
Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume or continue control of the defense
of any Third Person Claim if (i) the Third Person Claim relates to or arises
in connection with any criminal or regulatory proceeding, (ii) based on the
advice of outside legal counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict
(including the availability of different or additional defenses) exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor in connection with such Third
Person Claim or conduct of claim by the Indemnitor would compromise any legal
privilege or similar doctrine with respect to the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates or (iii) the Third Person Claim primarily seeks (x) an
injunction against the Indemnified Party or (y) where the Indemnified Party
is a Parent Indemnified Party, equitable relief requiring the taking of action
or the refraining from taking actions by Parent. The Indemnified Party agrees
to cooperate fully and in good faith with the Indemnitor in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third Person Claim. To the
extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such Third Person Claim by written
notice to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel at
the expense of the Indemnitor, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such proceeding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnitor shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 9.5_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in
addition to any local counsel who may need to be retained. The Indemnitor
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third Person Claim on
a basis that would not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party and would (i) exceed the balance of the Indemnitors indemnity
obligations hereunder if the Indemnified Party is a Stockholder, or exceed the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified
Party, (ii) result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or
decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) result in a finding or admission of a
violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) impose ongoing obligations on the
Indemnified Party following the date of such settlement or compromise.

 



56 (c) If the Indemnitor (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a
Third Person Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice
of its desire to so defend or otherwise or (ii) after assuming the defense of
a Third Person Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend
diligently such Third Person Claim within ten (10) days after receiving
written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnitor
has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the
obligation to assume its own defense; _it_   _being_ _understood_ that the
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a Third Person Claim shall
not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Person Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Person Claim seeking money
damages without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(d) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(e)_, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor shall reasonably cooperate in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense of a Third Person Claim, including by providing access to
each others relevant business records and other documents and employees;
_it_ _being_ _understood_ that the reasonable costs and expenses of the
Indemnified Party relating thereto shall constitute Losses.

 

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall use reasonable best efforts
to avoid production or other disclosure of confidential information
(consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among
employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third Person Claim
to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product
privileges. 

SECTION 9.6 _Determination of Indemnification Amounts_.

 

(a) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_Article_ __ _ IX_, Losses recoverable under this  _Article_ __ _ IX_ shall
be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds (other
than proceeds received pursuant to the RWI Policy), indemnification payments,
contribution payments or reimbursements actually received (net of costs of
enforcement, deductibles and retro-premium adjustments) by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Losses or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto. In any case where an Indemnified Party
recovers from third Persons any amount in respect of a matter with respect to
which an Indemnitor has indemnified it pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ IX_,
such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount
so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the reasonable
expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the
sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of
the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended
by the Indemnitor in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such
matter; _provided_ that no Indemnified Party shall be required to seek or
collect such recoveries prior to being entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(b) The Parties agree that any payments made pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _
IX_ shall constitute an adjustment to the Closing Merger Consideration for Tax
purposes and shall be treated as such by the Parties hereto for Tax purposes
to the greatest extent permitted by Law.

 



57 (c) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder
for any Losses arising from a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth herein (and the amount of any Losses incurred
in respect of such breach shall not be included in the calculation of any
limitations on indemnification set forth herein) to the extent such Losses
are included in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment,
Closing Indebtedness or Closing Transaction Expenses.

 

(d) In connection with the matters covered by this _Article_ __ _ IX_, no
Stockholder shall have (i) any right to indemnity or contribution from the
Company or (ii) any right of subrogation against the Company with respect to
any indemnification of the Parent Indemnified Parties by reason of any
indemnification provided in  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, it being agreed and
acknowledged that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
the Company herein are solely for the benefit of Parent and the Parent
Indemnified Parties.

 

SECTION 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything else contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, and except for Fraud claims, if the Closing
shall occur, the indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_, as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
(other than for specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.12_) for the parties hereto for breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision contained
in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument or document
delivered pursuant hereto or for any matter arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 9.8 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder
shall take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after
becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection
herewith.

SECTION 11.4 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or changed unless by written instrument signed on behalf of the

any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such

other right, power or remedy. All rights, powers and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights, powers or
remedies otherwise available.

SECTION 11.5 _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the
interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement,
including all claims (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon,

performance of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any claim or cause or action based upon, arising out of, or related

or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

SECTION 11.6 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Any litigation against any party to
this Agreement arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement shall
be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware

federal court within the State of Delaware) (together with the appellate

irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for
the purpose of any such litigation. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees not to assert (a) any objection which it may ever have to the laying of

litigation brought in any Chosen Court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party and (c) any claim that any
Chosen Court does not have jurisdiction with respect to such litigation. To
the extent that service of process by mail is permitted by applicable Law,

litigation in such courts by the mailing of such process by registered or

SECTION 11.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible, so far as
may be valid and enforceable, in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 

SECTION 11.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ (with respect to the Stockholders right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration) and  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ (each of which
provisions is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons referred to
therein and may be enforced by any such Person), nothing in this Agreement
shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Person not a party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall have the right to enforce the rights of the
Stockholders to pursue damages in the event of Parents or Merger Subs
willful and material breach of this Agreement or fraud. In addition, the
Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation to enforce any
rights of the Stockholders under this Agreement. No assignment of this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any party,
directly or indirectly (by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment
without the required consents shall be null and void.

SECTION 11.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

 



63 SECTION 11.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement, any Company Documents, the Parent
Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party
hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement, the Company Documents and the Parent Documents, as
applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_.

SECTION 11.12 _Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages or
legal remedies, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies
in equity or at law, each party shall be entitled to equitable relief,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain any breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement by any other party and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement without proof of
damages or otherwise to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other party, in
the Chosen Courts, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and
granted in connection therewith. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives: (i)
any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense
that a remedy at law would be adequate; and (ii) any requirement to post a
bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

(b) Each party hereto further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, a party hereto shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to such party under this Agreement in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __
_ 11.12_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ shall require any party hereto to
institute any Proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any
Proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ prior
or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article_ __ _
X_. To the extent any party hereto brings an action to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an
action to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such party hereto
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the End Date shall automatically be
extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of
such action, or (ii) such other time period established by the arbiter (or
court) presiding over such action.

 

SECTION 11.13 _Representative_.

 

(a) The Person designated by the Stockholders to act as Representative shall
be the agent and attorney-in-fact for each of the Stockholders to act as the
Representative under this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated
hereby in accordance with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.13_. In the
event of the resignation, death or incapacity of the Representative, a
successor Representative reasonably satisfactory to Parent shall thereafter be
appointed by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and such successor
Representative.

 



64 (b) The Representative is hereby authorized and empowered to act for, and on
behalf of, any or all of the Stockholders (with full power of substitution in
the premises) in connection with such matters as are reasonably necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other agreements contemplated hereby including: (i) to receive all payments
owing to the Stockholders under this Agreement, (ii) to terminate, amend,
waive any provision of, or abandon, this Agreement or the other agreements
contemplated hereby, (iii) to act as the representative of the Stockholders
to review and authorize all claims and disputes or question the accuracy
thereof, (iv) to negotiate and compromise on their behalf with Parent any
claims asserted hereunder and to authorize payments to be made with respect
thereto, (v) to take such further actions as are authorized in this Agreement
and the other agreements contemplated hereby, and (vi) in general, do all
things and perform all acts, including executing and delivering
all agreements (including the Escrow Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated in this Agreement), certificates, receipts, consents, elections,
instructions and other documents contemplated by, or deemed by the
Representative to be necessary or desirable in connection with, this
Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereby and the transactions
contemplated herein or therein. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to (x)
rely on such appointment and to treat the Representative as the duly
appointed attorney-in-fact of each Stockholder and (y) assume that all
actions, decisions and determinations of the Representative are fully
authorized. Notices given to the Representative in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement shall constitute notice to the Stockholders for
all purposes under this Agreement.

 

(c) The appointment of the Representative is an agency coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable and any action taken by the
Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this _Section_ __ _
11.13_ shall be effective and absolutely binding on each Stockholder
notwithstanding any contrary action of or direction from such Stockholder. The
death or incapacity, or dissolution or other termination of existence, of any
Stockholder shall not terminate the authority and agency of the
Representative. Parent, Merger Sub and any other party to any document
contemplated by this Agreement in dealing with the Representative may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any act of the
Representative as the act of the Stockholder.

 

(d) The Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder or to any other
Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub), with respect to any action taken or
omitted to be taken by the Representative in its role as Representative under
or in connection with this Agreement, unless such action or omission results
from or arises out of willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part
of the Representative, and the Representative shall not be liable to any
Stockholder in the event that, in the exercise of his, her or its reasonable
judgment, the Representative believes there will not be adequate resources
available to cover potential costs and expenses to contest a claim made by
Parent or Merger Sub.

 



65 (e) The Representative shall receive reimbursement from, and be indemnified
from, the Escrow Account and the Indemnity Escrow Account (to the extent any
funds are released therefrom pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_ for payment
of the Per Share Indemnity Escrow Release Amount to the Stockholders), for any
and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, charges and
liabilities, including attorneys fees, incurred by the Representative in the
performance or discharge of its duties pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.13_, except for any liability imposed by Law for gross negligence or
willful misconduct (the " _Representative Expenses_ ").

 

SECTION 11.14 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) In any dispute or Proceeding arising after the Effective Time under or in
connection with this Agreement or any the other agreement contemplated
hereby, the parties agree that any of the Stockholders shall have the right,
at their election to retain the firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and
Jacobson LLP (" _Fried Frank_ ") to represent such Stockholder in such
matter, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of themselves,
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and
representatives and their respective successors and assigns) hereby
irrevocably waive and consent to any such representation in any such matter.

(b) Each of the parties further agrees that, as to all communications among
Fried Frank, on the one hand, and any Stockholder, on the other hand, the
attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other
rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to such Stockholder, and shall not
