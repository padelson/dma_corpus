Stockholders (the " _Company Stockholder Representative_ ").

The respective Boards of Directors of the Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company

\- 3 -  (ii) each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to

such conversion, all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation shall be owned by the Buyer.

1.6 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the amounts payable in respect of such Company Shares pursuant to
_Article I_ unless the Company Stockholder holding such Dissenting Shares
shall have forfeited his, her or its right to appraisal under Section 262 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law or properly withdrawn his, her or its
demand for appraisal. If such Company Stockholder has so forfeited or
withdrawn his, her or its right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then, (i)
as of the occurrence of such event, such holders Dissenting Shares
shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent
the right to receive the amounts payable in respect of such Company Shares
pursuant to _Article I_ , and (ii) promptly following the occurrence of such
event, the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to such Company
Stockholder a payment representing the amount that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Article I_ of this Agreement.

 



\- 4 -  (b) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments that relate to such demands received by the Company and (ii)
the right, at its expense, to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the Delaware General Corporation
Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Buyer, make voluntarily any payment with respect to or offer to settle any
demands for appraisal of Company Shares for an amount that exceeds the
amounts that would have been otherwise payable for such Company Shares under
this Agreement.

1.7 _Options_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Company
Option that a holder has elected to receive a cash payment under Section 13(b)
of the Company Stock Plan and each Company Option that is otherwise
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of
Common Shares vested (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or any
acceleration of vesting provided for in employment agreements which may be
triggered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
under and issuable upon exercise of such Company Option as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the amount by which the Common
Cash Amount exceeds the per share exercise price of such Company Option (with
respect to each Company Option, the " _Option Payment_ "). Each Company
Option that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or any acceleration of
vesting provided for in employment agreements which may be triggered in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) shall be
cancelled. The Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
pay to each holder of a Company Option in cash promptly following the Closing
Date, in accordance with its standard payroll procedures, such holders
aggregate Option Payment (as so reduced by the terms and conditions of this
_Article I_ ) (and the Buyer shall make such payments, or cause such payments
to be made, to such holders in connection with the first payroll payment after
the receipt of such amount).

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
(i) with respect to a holder of a Company Option that is, pursuant to
_Section 1.7(a)_, cancelled and converted into a right to receive payments
under _Section 1.7(a)_, (1) such holders Pro Rata Portion of each of the
Escrow Amount, the Working Capital Escrow Amount and the Company Stockholder
Representative Amount has been funded, and such holder shall have a right to
receive such holders Pro Rata Portion of such amounts subject to and in
accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement; and (2) such holder has a right to receive such holders Pro
Rata Portion of each of the Initial Net Working Capital Adjustment (if any),
the Revised Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment (if any) and the Net Earn-
Out Amount (if any), in each case, subject to and in accordance with the
applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (ii) with respect to
any cash amounts that are withheld by, or remitted to, the Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation, in each case, which are payable to the holders of
Company Options that are cancelled and converted into a right to receive
payments under _Section 1.7(a)_, the Buyer shall, and, if applicable, shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, (1) hold all such amounts for the benefit
of such holders of Company Options and (2) pay to each such holder in cash, in
accordance with its standard payroll procedures (and shall make such payments
to such holders in connection with the first payroll payment after the
receipt of such amount), such holders Pro Rata Portion of such amount.

 



\- 5 -  (c) The Company shall not terminate any Company Stock Plans in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Buyer
shall assume the Company Stock Plans (but not any Company Options) effective
as of the Effective Time.

 

(d) The Buyer covenants and agrees that for any payments to holders of Company
Options for which an amount is subject to Tax in Canada, it will (i) elect in
prescribed form in accordance with subsection 110(1.1) of the _Income Tax Act_
(Canada) and (ii) not, and after the Closing will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries not to, take or claim any deduction in
computing its income under the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Option Payment and any payment on account of the
Initial Net Working Capital Adjustment (if any), the Revised Closing
Net Working Capital Adjustment (if any) and the Net Earn-Out Amount (if any).

1.8 _Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, the Buyer or Merger Sub shall deposit the Escrow
Amount with the Escrow Agent for the purpose of securing the indemnification
obligations of the Company Stockholders set forth in this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and for the purpose of compensating the Buyer and the other
Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses for which they are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Other than
in the case of fraud, any payments required to be made to any Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Article VI_ shall be made solely from the Escrow Fund.
The Escrow Fund, together with any interest and earnings thereon, shall be
held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms hereof and the Escrow
Agreement. At the close of business on the date that is nine months after the
Closing Date, fifty percent (50%) of the then-remaining Available Escrow Fund
shall be released to the Company Stockholders. At the close of business on the
date that is 18 months after the Closing Date, any then-remaining Available
Escrow Fund shall be released to the Company Stockholders. Thereafter, if at
any time there is any then-remaining Available Escrow Fund, such amount shall
be promptly released to the Company Stockholders. Upon any release of any
Available Escrow Fund to the Company Stockholders, each Company Stockholder
shall be paid his, her or its Pro Rata Portion of the amount of the Available
Escrow Fund that is released in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not
be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial
process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely
for the purposes and in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) On the Closing Date, the Buyer or Merger Sub shall deposit the Working
Capital Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent for the purpose of securing the
reimbursement obligations set forth in _Section 1.13(c)(iv)_ of this
Agreement. The Working Capital Escrow Fund, together with any interest and
earnings thereon, shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement. The payment of any Working Capital
Escrow Deficit required to be made to the Buyer pursuant to _Section
1.13(c)(iv)_ shall be made solely from the Working Capital Escrow Fund,
_provided_ , _that_ , if the Working Capital

 



\- 6 -   Escrow Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy any Working Capital Escrow
Deficit, then the Buyer may be reimbursed for any remaining Working Capital
Escrow Deficit solely from the Available Escrow Fund. If the Company
Stockholders are entitled to an additional payment pursuant to _Section
1.13(c)(iv)_, then the Buyer and the Company Stockholder Representative shall
promptly take all necessary steps to cause the Escrow Agent to release the
then remaining balance of the Working Capital Escrow Fund to the Company
Stockholders within five (5) business days after the date of determination of
the Revised Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment under  _Section 1.13(c)_.
Upon any release of such amount to the Company Stockholders, each Company
Stockholder shall be paid his, her or its Pro Rata Portion of such amount that
is released in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Working

payments without a stated maximum selling price under Section 453 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



\- 7 -  (e) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by
the stockholders of the Company shall constitute approval of the Escrow

the Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary is required or entitled
to deduct or withhold) the cash amount payable pursuant to _Section 1.5_,

Certificate shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right to
receive the amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence. Holders
of Company Certificates shall not be entitled to receive payment of any amount
until such Company Certificates are properly surrendered or other evidence of
ownership, reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, is properly submitted to the
Payment Agent.

holder or pursuant to _Article I_ of this Agreement that is delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar

Net Working Capital, and the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital shall for

Buyer and the Company prior to the Closing. The " _Initial Closing Net
Working Capital Adjustment_ " shall be determined immediately prior to
Closing as follows: (A) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less

shall be referred to herein as the " _Initial Closing Net Working Capital
Shortfall_ " and the Initial Payout Amount shall be reduced by the amount of
such shortfall (it being understood and agreed that Closing Net Working
Capital may be less than zero and that the downward adjustment to the Initial
Payout Amount may in such circumstances exceed seven million five hundred
thousand dollars ($7,500,000)) and (B) if the Estimated Closing Net Working

Capital Statement_ " and the " _Revised Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment_ " shall be equal to the difference between the Final Revised

\- 11 -   Estimated Closing Net Working Capital. The Company Stockholder
Representative will have reasonable access (including electronic access, to
the extent available), during normal business hours, to the applicable books,

Closing Net Working Capital Statement a statement setting forth the Company
Stockholder Representatives calculation of the Revised Closing Net Working
Capital and describing in reasonable detail the basis for the determination of

efforts to resolve such differences regarding the determination of the Revised
Closing Net Working Capital for a period of thirty (30) days after the Buyers
receipt of the dispute notice from the Company Stockholder Representative.

constitute final and binding acceptance by the Company Stockholder
Representative of all portions of the Revised Closing Net Working Capital
Statement other than those specifically identified in the dispute notice as
being subject to a good faith dispute.

differences during such time, then the Revised Closing Net Working Capital
they agree to shall be deemed to be the Final Revised Closing Net Working
Capital, the Revised Closing Net Working Capital Statement they agree to shall
be deemed to be the Final Revised Closing Net Working Capital Statement and
the Revised Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment shall be equal to
the difference between the Final Revised Closing Net Working Capital and the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital.

 

(B) If the Buyer and the Company Stockholder Representative do not reach a
final resolution on the Revised Closing Net Working Capital within thirty
(30) days after the Buyers receipt of dispute notice given by the Company
Stockholder Representative, unless the Buyer and the Company Stockholder
Representative mutually agree to continue their efforts to resolve such
differences, then either the Buyer or the Company Stockholder Representative

after submission. Absent manifest error, the Auditing Firms determination of
the Revised Closing Net Working Capital shall be deemed to be the Final
Revised Closing Net Working Capital, the Revised Closing Net Working Capital
Statement it prepares shall be deemed to be the Final Revised Closing Net
Working Capital Statement and the Revised Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment shall be equal to the difference between the Final Revised Closing
Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital. The fees
and expenses of the Auditing

 



\- 12 -   Firm shall be borne by the non-prevailing party; _provided_ that if the
Company Stockholder Representative is the non-prevailing party, then the
Company Stockholder Representative shall satisfy the payment of all such fees
and expenses solely from the Company Stockholder Representative Fund, and the
Company Stockholder Representative shall not be individually liable with
respect to all such amounts.

 

(C) The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in this _Section 1.13_ for
resolving disputes with respect to the Working Capital shall be the sole and
exclusive method for resolving any such disputes, provided that this provision
shall not prohibit any Party from instituting litigation to enforce the ruling
of the Auditing Firm.

 

(iv) If the Revised Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment is less than zero
(the " _Working Capital Escrow Deficit_ "), then the Buyer shall be entitled
to receive payment of the Working Capital Escrow Deficit solely from the
Working Capital Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 1.8(b)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the then-available Working Capital Escrow Fund is
insufficient to satisfy in full the Working Capital Escrow Deficit, then the
Buyer shall be reimbursed for any such shortfall from the Available Escrow
Fund. If the Revised Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment is greater than
zero, then the Buyer shall promptly pay (and in no event later than three (3)
business days after the date of determination of the Final Revised Closing Net
Working Capital) (i) to the Payment Agent, for distribution to the Company
Stockholders, the amount of the Revised Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment

Company Options that is entitled to a payment under _Section 1.7(a)_ such

the payment of all such fees and expenses solely from the Company Stockholder
Representative Fund, and the Company Stockholder Representative shall not be
individually liable with respect to all such amounts.

 



\- 16 -  (e) _Payment of Final Earn-Out Amount_. The Buyer shall deliver the Earn-Out
Amount, as so reduced by the amount of the Contingent Banking Fees (the Earn-
Out Amount so reduced, the " _Net Earn-Out Amount_ ") (and after giving to
such reduction, less the aggregate amount payable to former holders
of Company Options based on such holders Pro Rata Portion of such payment) to
the Payment Agent for distribution to the Company Stockholders within five (5)
business days after the final determination thereof, and the Buyer shall
instruct the Payment Agent to pay to each Company Stockholder his, her or its
Pro Rata Portion of the Net Earn-Out Amount within two (2) business days
thereafter. In addition to the foregoing payment, the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation shall, in accordance with its standard payroll practices, pay to
each former holder of Company Options such holders Pro Rata Portion of the
Net Earn-Out Amount (and the Buyer shall make such payments to such holders in
connection with the first payroll payment after the receipt of such amount).

(f) _No Assignment of Earn-Out Rights_. No interest in the Net Earn-Out
Amount or any portion thereof, no right to participate, in whole or in part,
in the Net Earn-Out Amount pursuant to _Section 1.14_, and no right to
receive any distribution of cash in connection therewith pursuant to 
_Section 1.14_ may be assigned or transferred to any Person (whether by
operation of law, or in connection with any sale, assignment or other transfer
of any Common Shares, shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or otherwise), and
any attempt to do so will be void. The Net Earn-Out Amount and the provisions
of _Section 1.14_ relating to the Net Earn-Out Amount are intended solely for
the benefit of the Company Stockholders and the holders of Company Options,
and the right (if any) to receive distributions in connection with the Net
Earn- Out Amount shall be personal to those Persons; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any and all rights under this _Section 1.14_ of any Company Stockholder
or holder of a Company Option that is an (i) individual shall be freely
assignable and transferrable (by operation of law or otherwise) in the case of
the death or any such individual to such individuals estate, spouse,
children, ancestors and/or any descendants of any ancestors and (ii) entity
shall be freely assignable and transferrable to such entitys successors, any
transferee of all or substantially all of such entitys assets, or with the
prior written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld).

(g) _Diligence_. During the Earn-Out Period, the Buyer and its Affiliates,
including without limitation, the Surviving Corporation, shall not, in bad
faith, take any action (or fail to take any action) with the intent or effect
of preventing the Company Stockholders and former holder of Company Options
the opportunity to achieve the maximum Earn-Out Amount. Subject to the
foregoing, the Buyer shall have absolute discretion to operate its business in
its sole best interest, without regard to how its action (or inactions) would
affect the Company Stockholders opportunity to achieve the Earn-Out Amount
(or any portion thereof). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
for "socket refreshes" listed on _Section 1.14(g) of the Disclosure Schedule_
(as updated prior to the Effective Time upon the mutual agreement of the
Buyer and the Company, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) the Buyer shall devote such sales, technical, marketing,
operating, development, engineering, administrative and financial resources
as the Buyer believes, in the Buyers sole discretion, is appropriate for the
development, support and promotion of the Company Components for such "socket
refreshes." In the event that the Company or any Subsidiary fails to develop
a part meeting the written performance and reliability specifications as
reasonably requested by a customer for a "socket refresh" or if a customer
makes a bona fide unsolicited request to use a component of Buyer or its
subsidiaries for such "socket refresh", for any reason,

 



\- 17 -   then Buyer shall have the option to utilize its own component to meet this
customer need and, for the avoidance of doubt, any related revenue resulting
from any sale of a component of Buyer or its subsidiaries under the
circumstances described in this sentence shall not count toward Applicable
Revenue.

 

(h) _No Interest_. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any portion of the
Net Earn-Out Amount or any payment or distribution pursuant to _Section
1.14_ relating to the Net Earn-Out Amount.

1.15 _Company Stockholder Representative_. To facilitate the administration
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the resolution
of any disputes relating to, the Earn-Out Amount (if any), the Revised Closing
Net Working Capital Adjustment (if any), and claims for indemnification
pursuant to _Article VI_ , and any other actions required or permitted to be
taken by the Company Stockholder Representative under this Agreement, the
Buyer and the Company, by their execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
the stockholders of the Company and Persons otherwise having the right to
direct the voting of the Companys stock pursuant to the Common Voting Trust
Agreement or the Class A-1 Voting Trust Agreement, and the adoption of this
Agreement by stockholders constituting the Requisite Stockholder Consent,
hereby (x) designate the Company Stockholder Representative as the
representative, attorney-in-fact and agent of each Company Stockholder and (y)
authorize the Company Stockholder Representative to give and receive all
notices required to be given under this Agreement, and to take any and all
additional action as is necessary, convenient, appropriate or contemplated to
be taken by or on their behalf or by the Company Stockholder Representative
in connection with the Company Stockholder Representatives rights, duties and
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement.

 

(a) In the event that the Company Stockholder Representative becomes unwilling
or unable to perform his, her or its responsibilities hereunder or resigns
from such position, the Company Stockholders (acting by written consent by a
majority in interest of the Company Stockholders, voting together as a single
class) shall select another representative to fill the vacancy of the Company
Stockholder Representative named in this Agreement, and such substituted
representative shall succeed the former Company Stockholder Representative and
be deemed to be the Company Stockholder Representative for all purposes
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the documents delivered
pursuant hereto and thereto.

(b) All decisions and actions by the Company Stockholder Representative in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i)
the determination and calculation of, and resolution of any disputes relating
to, the Earn-Out Amount (if any) or the Revised Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment (if any), (ii) the resolution and disposition of any claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Article VI_ , and (iii) any other actions
required or permitted to be taken by the Company Stockholder Representative
under this Agreement, shall be binding upon each Company Stockholder, and no
Company Stockholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same or to revoke the agency of the Company Stockholder
Representative.

 



\- 18 -  (c) Any decision, act, consent, waiver or instruction of the
Company Stockholder Representative in connection with this Agreement shall
constitute a decision of all the Company Stockholders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each Company Stockholder, and the Buyer shall be
entitled to rely conclusively on the decisions, acts, consents, waivers and
instructions of the Company Stockholder Representative as to any determination
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as being the
decision, act, consent, waiver or instruction of every Company Stockholder,
including without limitation (i) the determination and calculation of, and
resolution of any disputes relating to, the Earn-Out Amount (if any) or the
Revised Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment (if any), (ii) the resolution
and disposition of any claims for indemnification pursuant to _Article VI_ ,
and (iii) any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the Company
Stockholder Representative under this Agreement; no Person shall have any
cause of action against the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates for any action
taken by the Buyer in reliance upon any decision, act, consent, waiver
or instruction of the Company Stockholder Representative; and the Buyer is
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by it in
accordance with such decision, act, consent, waiver or instruction of the
Company Stockholder Representative.

(d) All actions, omissions, decisions, consents, waivers and instructions of
the Company Stockholder Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon
Company Stockholders and neither the Buyer nor any Company Stockholder shall
have any cause of action against the Company Stockholder Representative for
any action taken, decision made or consent, waiver or instruction given by
the Company Stockholder Representative under this Agreement, except for fraud
or willful misconduct by the Company Stockholder Representative.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 1.15_ are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that the Buyer or any Company
Stockholder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(f) The Company Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to seek
reimbursement from the Company Stockholder Representative Escrow Fund for any
reasonable expenses incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part
of the Company Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Company Stockholder
Representatives duties hereunder (" _Representative Reimbursable Expenses_
"). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company Stockholder Representative
shall have the right to engage legal counsel and other professional advisers
to assist it in the administration of the Company Stockholder Representatives
duties hereunder, and any and all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
and advisers shall be deemed Representative Reimbursable Expenses. 

(g) The Company Stockholder Representative shall be indemnified by the Company
Stockholders for, and shall be held harmless against, any loss, liability or
expense incurred by the Company Stockholder Representative or any of its
Affiliates and any of their respective partners, directors, officers,
employees, agents, stockholders, consultants, attorneys, accountants,
advisors, brokers, representatives or controlling persons, in each case
relating to the Company Stockholder Representatives conduct as the Company
Stockholder Representative, other than losses, liabilities or expenses
resulting from the Company Stockholder Representatives gross negligence or
willful misconduct in connection with its performance

 



\- 19 -   under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. This indemnification shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. The costs of such indemnification
(including the costs and expenses of enforcing this right of indemnification)
may be paid from the Company Stockholder Representative Fund (and in no event
shall such costs be paid from either the Escrow Fund or the Working Capital
Escrow Fund prior to the time such amounts are otherwise distributable to the
Company Stockholders). In the event it is finally adjudicated that a loss,
liability or expense or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company Stockholder Representative,
the Company Stockholder Representative will reimburse the Company Stockholders
the amount of such indemnified loss, liability or expense attributable to such
gross negligence or willful misconduct. With the prior written consent
of Prism Venture Partners IV, L.P., any such losses, liabilities or expenses
may be recovered by the Company Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds
in the Company Stockholder Representative Fund, (ii) the amounts in the Escrow
Funds otherwise distributable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to the
terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement at the time of distribution, and (iii)
from any Net Earn-Out Amounts actually payable to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to written instructions delivered by the Company Stockholder
Representative to the Buyer; _provided that_ while this section allows the
Company Stockholder Representative to be paid from the Company Stockholder
Representative Escrow Fund, the Escrow Fund and the Earn-Out Amounts, this
does not relieve the Company Stockholders from their obligation to promptly
pay such Representative Reimbursable Expenses as such Representative
Reimbursable Expenses are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Company Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to
it at law or otherwise. The Company Stockholder Representative may, in all
questions arising under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, rely on the
advice of counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by
the Company Stockholder Representative in accordance with such advice, the
Company Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the Company
Stockholders or the Escrow Agent or any other Person

(h) The Buyer shall, and cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective
direct and indirect subsidiaries to, provide the Company Stockholder
Representative with reasonable access (including electronic access, to the
extent available) to information and documents concerning any disputes
relating to the Earn-Out Amount (if any), the Revised Closing Net Working
Capital Adjustment (if any) and claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Article VI_ and which is in the possession, custody or control of the Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective direct or
indirect subsidiaries and the reasonable assistance of the officers and
employees of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
direct or indirect subsidiaries for purposes of performing the Company
Stockholder Representatives duties under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and exercising the Company Stockholder Representatives rights under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided that_ the Company
Stockholder Representative shall treat confidentially and not, except in
connection with enforcing its rights and otherwise performing its
responsibilities under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, disclose any
nonpublic information from or concerning any of the foregoing to
anyone, except that (i) the Company Stockholder Representative may disclose
to its employees, independent contractors, legal counsel, accountants,
representatives, agents and other advisors and skilled Persons (for the same
limited purposes as to which the Company Stockholder Representative may use
such information set forth in this _Section 1.15(h_)) any information
disclosed to such Company Stockholder Representative pursuant to this _Section
1.15(h)_, _provided that_  all such Persons agree to treat such information
confidentially, (ii) the

 



\- 20 -   Company Stockholder Representative (or such other Person to whom information
is disclosed pursuant to clause (i) above) may disclose in any proceeding
relating to a claim for indemnification under _Article VI_ or a dispute
relating to _Section 1.13_ or _Section 1.14_ (or, in either case,
discussions in preparation therefor) any information disclosed to the Company
Stockholder Representative pursuant to this  _Section 1.15(h)_, _provided
that_ the Company Stockholder Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, if available, an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information, and (iii) the Company Stockholder Representative may disclose to
the Company Stockholders any information disclosed to the Company Stockholder
Representative pursuant to this _Section 1.15(h)_,  _provided that_ such
Company Stockholders agree to treat such information confidentially.

1.16 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each of
the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent and any Payment Agent
designated by the foregoing will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person,
such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code or any other legal
requirement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the Buyer
determines that such withholding is required in respect of the payments to be
made to Company Stockholders, the Buyer shall notify the Company (if prior to
the Closing), the Escrow Agent, the Payment Agent and the Company Stockholder
Representative, in writing of the amount that it intends to withhold and the
legal basis for the requirement of such withholding, (a) with respect to the
Initial Payout Amount at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, (b)
with respect to the Revised Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, at least
two (2) days prior to the date of the payment of such amount and (c) with
respect to the Net Earn-Out Amount, at least two (2) days prior to the date
of payment of such amount. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent or Payment
Agent, such deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made. The Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Payment Agent to, provide all Forms W-9, W-8 and similar tax documentation in
its possession to the Escrow Agent and/or the Company Stockholder
Representative upon request of the Company Stockholder Representative.

accordance with its terms, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Buyer
supplemental information concerning events or circumstances occurring

Companys statements and disclosures in the Disclosure Schedule.

with any party (other than the Buyer) concerning any merger, reorganization,

business, properties or assets of the Company, any Subsidiary or any division
of the Company to any party (other than the Buyer), in each case, in
connection with an Alternative Transaction or (iv) engage in discussions or
negotiations with any party (other than the Buyer) concerning any Alternative
Transaction; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that prior to receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in response to a _bona fide,_ written
Proposal (as defined in _Section 4.7(e)_) that is made by a Person the Board
of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith, is reasonably capable
of making a Superior Proposal (as defined in _Section 4.7(e)_) and that the
Board of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel, is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal that was not solicited by the
Company or any of its Representatives and that did not otherwise result from a
breach or a deemed breach of this  _Section 4.7_, and subject to compliance
with _Section 4.7(c)_ below, (x) furnish information with respect to the
Company to the person making such Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement not less restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations (including
solicitation of a revised Proposal) with such Person and its officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates, investment bankers,
advisors, representatives or agents regarding any Proposal.

 



\- 51 -  (b) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not approve or recommend
any Proposal by a third party, or withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
the Buyer its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or fail to solicit the vote of its
stockholders as required by this Agreement or enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal or publicly resolve to do any of
the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the
Company may withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that each of the following shall
have been true and complied with, as applicable, prior to the Board of
Directors of the Company or the Company, as the case may be, taking any such
action: (i) the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been previously
obtained, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior
Proposal, (iii) in light of such Superior Proposal the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of the Requisite Stockholder Approval is reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duty under applicable Law, (iv) Company
has notified the Buyer in writing of the determinations described in _clause
(iii)_ of this _Section 4.7(b)_, (v) at least three business days
following receipt by the Buyer of the notice referred to in _clause (iv)_ of
this _Section 4.7(b)_, and taking into account any revised proposal made by
the Buyer since receipt of the notice referred to in _clause (iv)_
above, such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and the Board of
Directors of the Company has again made the determinations referred to in
_clause (iii)_ of this _Section 4.7(b)_, and (vi) the Company is in
compliance with this _Section 4.7_.

(c) The Company shall promptly advise the Buyer orally and in writing of (A)
the receipt by it or by any of its Representatives after the date hereof of
any Proposal, or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information in connection with such a
Proposal and (B) the terms and conditions of any such Proposal or inquiry.
Such notice to the Buyer will indicate in reasonable detail the identity of
the person making, and the terms of, the Proposal or inquiry. The Company
shall (i) keep the Buyer fully informed of the status including any change to
the material terms or details of any Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to
the Buyer as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies
of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the
Company from any third party in connection with any Proposal or sent or
provided by the Company to any third party in connection with any Proposal.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.7_ shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required
disclosure to the Company Stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable law. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 4.7_, the Board of
Directors of the Company may not take any action that would result in the
Company Stockholders no longer being legally capable under Delaware General
Corporation Law of validly approving the Merger.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Proposal_ " means any inquiries, proposals, offers or bids with
respect to an Alternative Transaction; and

 



\- 52 -  (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Proposal made by a third party (other
than the Buyer, Merger Sub or any Affiliate thereof) that (1) contains terms
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith to be
superior from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Shares
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (based on the advice of
a nationally recognized independent financial advisor), taking into account
all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including
any proposal by the Buyer to amend the terms of the this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby) and (2) is reasonably likely to be
consummated, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal, and assuming this Agreement has been terminated.

4.8 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Sections 4.2_ and _4.13(b)_ ,
_Article VI_ and the Escrow Agreement, each of the Parties shall bear its own
costs and expenses (including investment banking, legal and accounting fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

4.9 _Retention of Key Employees; Benefits_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to support
the Buyer in retaining in the employ of the Surviving Corporation after the
Closing the employees of the Company identified in _Section 4.9(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Key Employees_ ") and shall use reasonable
efforts to support the Buyer in causing the employees identified in _Section
4.9(b) of the Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Designated Employees_ ") to enter
into the Buyers standard form of confidentiality, non-solicitation and
assignment of inventions agreement (the " _Buyer Form NDA_ "). In connection
therewith, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to support the Buyer in
the following ways: (i) prior to the Closing, delivering copies of the Buyer
Form NDA to the Designated Employees, and (ii) prior to the Closing,
delivering copies of such employment agreements for Key Employees as Buyer may
reasonably request. In addition, prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to facilitate meetings between the Buyer and the Key
Employees and the Designated Employees. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this _Section 4.9(a)_, in no event shall the Company be
required to dispose of assets or make any changes to its business,
terminate any employee (or threaten to do the same), expend any funds (or
agree to do the same) or incur any other burden, liability or obligation in
connection with complying with its obligations in this _Section 4.9(a)_.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 4.9(c)_, the Company and the Company Stockholder
Representative acknowledge and agree that it is the intent of Buyer to offer,
or to cause the Surviving Corporation to offer, continued employment or a
consulting relationship with the Buyer, on terms satisfactory to the Buyer, to
the Key Employees and the Designated Employees and, in the sole discretion of
the Buyer, continue the employment of the other Company employees
(collectively, the " _Hired Company Employees_ "). Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit
plans to treat, the service of the Hired Company Employees with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries attributable to any period before the Effective Time
as service rendered to the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting and for levels of benefits other than
for defined benefits plans and only to the extent taken in account under the
Companys comparable benefit plans. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer
shall cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting
periods or required physical examinations under any health or

 



\- 53 -   similar plan of the Buyer to be waived with respect to the Hired Company
Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the
corresponding plan in which the Hired Company Employees participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and any deductibles paid by the Hired
Company Employees under any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries health plans
in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be credited towards
deductibles under the health plans of the Buyer or any direct or indirect
subsidiary of the Buyer. The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts and subject to applicable
Law to make appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure
such result and only to the extent that Hired Company Employees become subject
to or eligible to participate in employee benefits plans of the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation during the current plan year.

(c) No provision of this _Section 4.9_ shall create any third-
party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any Subsidiary in respect
of continued employment (or resumed employment) with the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or any of the Buyers direct or indirect subsidiaries, and no
provision of this _Section 4.9_ shall create such rights in any such Persons
in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any employee program or any plan or arrangement that may be established by
the Buyer or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. No provision of this
Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or
terminate after the Effective Time any such plans or arrangements of the
Buyer or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries.

4.10 _Termination of 401 (k) Plan_.

(a) The Companys Board of Directors or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Companys 401(k) plan (the " _401(k) Plan_ "), shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to terminate the
401(k) Plan no later than the day before the Closing Date, on terms
satisfactory to Buyer. 

(b) The Buyer shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) take such
actions as are necessary to cause a retirement plan maintained by it or one
of its ERISA Affiliates that is qualified under Section 401 (a) of the
Internal Revenue Code to accept direct and indirect rollover distributions of
the Companys employees balances under the Companys 401(k) Plan, including
promissory notes evidencing outstanding plan loans (if any), but only to the
extent that the Buyers applicable retirement plan provides for participant
plan loans and subject to the outside administrator of the Buyers applicable
retirement plan accepting such plan loan (and the Buyer shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause such administrator to accept such loan).

 

4.11 _280G Payments Vote_. To the extent the Company (in consultation with the
Buyer) reasonably determines that such a vote is required, prior, to the
Effective Time, the Company shall submit to a stockholder vote, in a manner
that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the right of any "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G(c) of the Internal Revenue Code) to receive any and
all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of

 



\- 54 -   Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) to the extent
necessary so that, no payment received by such "disqualified individual" shall
be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Internal Revenue Code
(determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue
Code). Such vote shall establish the disqualified individuals right to the
payment or other compensation and the Company shall obtain any required
waivers or consents from the disqualified individual prior to the vote. In
connection with such vote, the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to
the Company Stockholders of all material facts concerning all payments to any
such disqualified individual that, but for such vote, could be deemed
"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code in a
manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code
and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Buyer and its counsel shall have
the right to review and comment on all documents required to be delivered to
the Company Stockholders in connection with such vote (including the
disclosure described above) and any required disqualified individual waivers
or consents and Buyer and its counsel shall be provided copies of all vote
documents executed by the stockholders and disqualified individuals.

 

4.12 _FIRPTA_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Buyer a certification that the Company Shares are not United
States real property interests as defined in Section 897(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code, together with a notice to the Internal Revenue Service, in
accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Sections 897 and 1445 of the
Internal Revenue Code. If the Company has not provided such certification and
notice to the Buyer on or before the Closing Date, the Buyer shall be
permitted to withhold from the payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement
any required withholding Tax under Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code.

4.13 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

(a) Buyer and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation now existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of, each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary
and agent of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided for in their respective
certificates of incorporation, charters, by-laws or otherwise in effect as of
the date hereof shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
(6) years from the Effective Time. During such period, Buyer shall not, nor
shall it permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification in
any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individual who at any time on or prior to the Effective Time was a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement), unless such modification is required by applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
claims asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer and
the Surviving Corporation also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
present and former officers and directors of the Company or any Subsidiary in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the
extent provided in any written indemnification agreements with the Company or
any Subsidiary except with respect to matters for which the Buyer is
indemnified under _Article VI_. Notwithstanding any other rights to
indemnification any such director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent may
have, including without limitation from any private equity or venture capital
fund or management company with which such Person was or is affiliated or
associated, the obligations specified herein are to be the primary source of
indemnification for such Person.

 



\- 55 -  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extension (the
" _D andO Tail Insurance_") of its directors and officers liability insurance
covering those persons who are currently covered by the current Company
directors and officers liability insurance policy (the " _Company Insured
Parties_ ") on terms not substantially less favorable to the Company Insured
Parties than those of Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance policy a copy of which has been made available to the Buyer. The
DandO Tail Insurance shall provide coverage for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time for losses to which the Company Insured Parties may be
subject based on pre-Closing occurrences. The premium for the six years of
coverage of DandO Tail Insurance shall be determined prior to the Effective
Time, and is referred to herein as the " _D andO Tail Insurance Premium
Amount_." The Company shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the DandO Tail Insurance
Premium Amount and such payment will be deemed to be a Transaction Expense,
the Buyer shall pay the remainder of the DandO Tail Insurance Premium Amount and
such payment will not be deemed to be a Transaction Expense. The Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in full force and
effect the DandO Tail Insurance for a period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(c) In the event Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume

and the Escrow Agreement, from and after the Closing, the Buyer or any
Affiliate thereof shall be indemnified in respect of, and held harmless
against, in each case, solely from the Escrow Fund, any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer or any
Affiliate thereof resulting from, relating to or constituting:

(a) any inaccuracy in any representation or breach of any warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument
executed by the Company and furnished by the Company to the Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement, whether as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing
Date (except to the extent such representations or warranties are specifically
made as of a particular date, in which case, as of such date); 

(b) any breach or nonperformance of (or noncompliance with) any covenant or
agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument furnished by the Company to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

(c) any amount by which the Working Capital Escrow Fund is insufficient to
satisfy in full the Working Capital Escrow Deficit as determined in accordance
with _Section 1.8(b)_ and  _Section 1.13_; or

(d) any claim made by holders of Dissenting Shares to the extent Losses
exceed the amount the holders of such Dissenting Shares would have otherwise
received under this Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ (i) the Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation will have given the Company Stockholder
Representative (A) written notice of any written demand for appraisal,
withdrawal of a demand for appraisal and any other instrument served pursuant
to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law received by the Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate thereof and (B) an opportunity to

commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute regarding such

written settlement agreement that is approved by the Company Stockholder
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or
(Y) final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

6.2  _Indemnification Claims_.

(a) _Third Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made under
this Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-party
claim against an Indemnified Party shall be made in accordance with the
following procedures. A Person entitled to indemnification under this _Article
VI_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give prompt written notification to
the Company Stockholder Representative (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ") of
the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding relating to a third
party claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the
assertion of any such claim by a third party; _provided_ , that a failure to
notify or delay in notifying the Company Stockholder Representative will not
relieve the Company Stockholder Representative of its obligations pursuant to
this _Article VI_ , except to the extent that such claim is actually
prejudiced as a result thereof. Such Third Party Claim Notice shall include a
description in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified
Party) of the facts constituting the basis for such third party claim and the
amount of the Losses claimed (the " _Third Party Claim Amount_ "). Within 30
days after delivery of such Third Party Claim Notice, the Company Stockholder
Representative may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party,
assume control of the defense of any such action, suit, proceeding or claim in
which (i) the third-party claimant seeks only the recovery of monetary
damages and (ii) the Company Stockholder Representative agrees that, subject
to the

 



\- 59 -   limitations set forth in this _Article VI_ , the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification for any Losses incurred or suffered by it
resulting from such claim, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. If the Company Stockholder Representative does not assume
control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The
party not controlling such defense may participate therein at its own expense
(provided that if the non-controlling participating party is the Company
Stockholder Representative, the obligation to pay such expenses shall be
solely on behalf of the Company Stockholders and in its capacity as the
Company Stockholder Representative, not in its individual capacity);
_provided_ that if the Company Stockholder Representative assumes control of
such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice
from counsel, that the Company Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified
Party have conflicting interests with respect to such action, suit, proceeding
or claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party
solely in connection therewith shall be considered Losses for purposes of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Indemnified Parties be entitled to be indemnified for the fees and expenses of
more than one (1) counsel for all Indemnified Parties. The party controlling
such defense shall keep the other party advised of the status of such action,
suit, proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and shall consider
recommendations made by the other party with respect thereto. If the Company
Stockholder Representative does not assume the defense, the Indemnified Party
may not agree to any settlement of such action, suit, proceeding or claim
without the prior written consent of the Company Stockholder Representative
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Company
Stockholder Representative shall not agree to any settlement of such action,
suit, proceeding or claim that (A) does not include a complete release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto, (B) imposes any
liability, injunction, equitable relief or other obligation on the Indemnified
Party, (C) results in Losses in excess of the then Available Escrow Funds or
(D) results in a material increase in Taxes of the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries in a tax period ending after the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 6.2(a)_, the Company Stockholder Representative shall not be
entitled to control, and the Buyer shall instead control, the defense of any
action, suit, proceeding or claim with respect to Taxes of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries attributable to any period ending after the Closing Date.

(b)  _Procedure for Claims Not Involving Third Parties_. An Indemnified Party
wishing to assert a claim for indemnification under this _Article VI_ that
does not involve a third- party claim shall deliver to the Company
Stockholder Representative a Claim Notice. Within 30 days after delivery of a
Claim Notice, the Company Stockholder Representative shall deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written response in which the Company Stockholder
Representative shall (A) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive all of the Claim Amount (in which case the Company Stockholder
Representative shall take such actions as are required pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement to cause the Claimed Amount to be released to the Buyer from the
Escrow Fund), (B) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
part, but not all, of the Claim Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ ") (in which
case the Company Stockholder Representative shall take such actions as are
required pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to cause the Agreed Amount to be
released to the Buyer from the Escrow Fund) or (C) contest that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claim Amount. If the
Company Stockholder Representative in such response contests the payment of
all or part of the Claim Amount, the Company Stockholder Representative and
the Indemnified Party shall use good faith and commercially reasonable 

 



\- 60 -   efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within 60
days following the delivery by the Company Stockholder Representative of such
response, the Company Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Party
shall each have the right to submit such dispute to a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.12_.

 

(c) _Authority of Company Stockholder Representative_. The Company Stockholder
Representative shall have full power and authority on behalf of each Company
Stockholder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute any and all
instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights of, the
Company Stockholders under this _Article VI_. The Company Stockholder
Representative shall have no liability to any Company Stockholder for any
action taken or omitted on behalf of the Company Stockholders pursuant to this
_Article VI_.

 

6.3 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Each Partys representations
and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall expire
on the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time. If an
Indemnified Party delivers to Company Stockholder Representative, before the
expiration of a representation or warranty, either a Claim Notice based upon
a breach of such representation or warranty, or an Expected Claim Notice based
upon a breach of such representation or warranty, then the applicable
representation or warranty shall survive until, but only for purposes of,
the resolution of any claims arising from or related to the matter covered by
such notice. If the legal proceeding or written claim with respect to which an
Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in
favor of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in
no event later than three (3) days after the date of such withdrawal or
resolution) so notify the Company Stockholder Representative; and if the
Indemnified Party has delivered a copy of the Expected Claim Notice to the
Escrow Agent and funds have been retained in escrow after the Termination
Dates (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) with respect to such Expected Claim
Notice, the Company Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Party
shall promptly (and in no event later than three (3) days after the date of
such withdrawal or resolution) deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice
executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse
such retained funds to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement. The rights to indemnification set forth in this
_Article VI_ shall not be affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) by the Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or
noncompliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which
is the subject of indemnification hereunder or (ii) any waiver by the Buyer or
Merger Sub of any closing condition relating to the accuracy of
representations and warranties or the performance of or compliance with
agreements and covenants. Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ shall be construed to
limit the survival of covenants, agreements and obligations that by their
terms are to be performed or observed after the Effective Time or for which
another time period is specified in this Agreement.

 



\- 61 -  6.4 _Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Escrow
Agreement, other than for claims involving fraud, and subject to the

Escrow Agreement unless and until the aggregate Losses for which they or it
would otherwise be entitled under this _Article VI_ exceed five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) (the " _Threshold_ "), at which point the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund all
Losses indemnified under this _Article VI_ and not just those Losses in
excess of the Threshold. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or
the Escrow Agreement, other than for claims involving fraud, and subject to

for any amount of indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Escrow Fund and the

Fund.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Escrow
Agreement, other than for claims involving fraud, and subject to the

Parties for (x) indemnifiable Losses under this Article VI and the Escrow
Agreement or (y) inaccuracies in or breaches of or failure to perform the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and obligations of the
Company under or in connection with this Agreement or any agreement, document,
certificate or instrument executed by the Company and furnished by the Company
to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except for claims for
indemnification involving fraud, the Available Escrow Fund shall be the sole
and exclusive source of recovery for indemnifiable Losses under this _Article
VI_. In the case of claims for indemnification of Losses resulting from fraud,
each Company Stockholder shall be liable only for such holders respective Pro
Rata Portion of the indemnifiable Losses, and in no event shall any holders
liability for such Losses exceed the aggregate amount paid to such holder
pursuant to _Article I_ of this Agreement.

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall be construed to limit the Buyers
rights under  _Section 9.14_. No Company Stockholder shall have any right of
contribution or subrogation against the Company or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to any breach by the Company of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements.

transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Escrow
Agreement, any Loss for which any Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this _Article VI_ shall be determined without

covenant or agreement.

 



\- 62 -  (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the
Escrow Agreement, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article VI for any Losses to the extent such Losses are
included as current liabilities in the Final Revised Closing Net Working
Capital.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Escrow
Agreement, the amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this

any Indemnified Party on account of such Losses and/or (ii) any
indemnification payments received by the Indemnified Party from any third
party with respect to such Losses. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein or in the Escrow Agreement, no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to any indemnification under this Article VI or the Escrow Agreement
for any Losses to the extent any Indemnified Party could have, with
reasonable efforts, mitigated or prevented the Loss.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Escrow
Agreement, any indemnification with respect to Taxes shall be limited to
Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary for taxable periods (or portions

\- 79 -  Any Party may give any notice, request, demand, claim or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited
courier, messenger service, or ordinary mail), but no such notice, request,
demand, claim or other communication that is given by such other means shall
be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it actually is received by
the party for whom it is intended. Any Party may change the address to which
notices, requests, demands, claims, and other communications hereunder are to
be delivered by giving the other Parties a minimum of five (5) business days
prior written notice in the manner herein set forth.

9.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. The Parties may mutually amend any provision of
this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any amendment effected subsequent to the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall
be subject to any restrictions contained in the Delaware General Corporation
Law. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by all of the Parties or, after the
Effective Time, by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Stockholder Representative. No waiver of any right or remedy hereunder shall
be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Party giving
such waiver. No waiver by any Party with respect to any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

9.10 _Severability; Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement is
finally judicially determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under
any present or future law, and if the rights or obligations of any Party under
this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such
provision shall be fully severable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and
enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never
comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom, and (d) in
lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

9.11  _Governing Law_. All matters arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without
limitation its interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement)
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of
the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than
those of the State of Delaware.

9.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party (a) submits to the jurisdiction
of any state or federal court sitting in the City of Dover or Wilmington in
the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement (including any action or proceeding for the enforcement
of any arbitral award made in connection with any arbitration of a Dispute
hereunder), (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) waives any claim of
inconvenient forum or other challenge to venue in such court, (d) agrees not
to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to

 



\- 80 -   this Agreement in any other court; provided in each case that, solely with
respect to any arbitration of a Dispute, the Arbitrator shall resolve all
threshold issues relating to the validity and applicability of the
arbitration provisions of this Agreement, contract validity, applicability of
statutes of limitations and issue preclusion, and such threshold issues shall
not be heard or determined by such court. Each Party agrees to accept service
of any summons, complaint or other initial pleading made in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in _Section 9.8_, provided that nothing in
this _Section 9.12_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve
such summons, complaint or other initial pleading in any other manner
permitted by law.

9.13 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREFROM, THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO TRIAL
WITHOUT A JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY
HERETO OR ITS SUCCESSORS AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ITS SUCCESSORS IN
RESPECT OF ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

9.14 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is agreed by the Parties that each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
the United States or any state having jurisdiction without the requirement of
posting a bond or other security, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity.

 

9.15 _Construction_.

(a) The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language
chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Party. 

(b) Any reference to any Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.

(c) Any reference to any Article, Section or paragraph shall be deemed to
refer to an Article, Section or paragraph of this Agreement, unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise.

(d) The Parties hereto agree that this Agreement is the product of negotiation
between sophisticated parties and individuals, all of whom were or had the
opportunity to be represented by counsel, and each of whom had an opportunity
to participate in or did participate in the drafting of each provision hereof.
Accordingly, ambiguities in this Agreement, if any, shall not be construed
strictly or in favor of or against any Party but rather shall be given a fair
and reasonable construction without regard to the rule of _contra
proferentem._

(e) Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) words of
either gender or the neuter include the other gender and the neuter, (ii)
words using the singular number also include the plural number and words using
the plural number also include the

 



\- 81 -   singular number, (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and derivative
or similar words refer to this entire Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular Article, Section or other subdivision, (iv) the terms
"Article" or "Section" or other subdivision refer to the specified Article,
Section or other subdivision of the body of this Agreement, (v) the
words "include," "includes," "including" and other similar words shall be
deemed to be followed by the phrase "but not limited to," (vi) when a
reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, such reference shall be to
an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated and (vii) for any
document or other item to have been "made available" heretofore or prior to
the execution or date of this Agreement such document or other item must be
deposited at least six (6) hours prior to the time that this Agreement was
executed by the Parties (or if deposited more recently, provided such notice
of such deposit and a copy of thereof was give to the Buyer) into the data
room heretofore established by the Company with written notice of such
deposit and a copy of such deposit was made to the Buyer and (x) all
references to "dollars" or "$" shall refer to the lawful currency of the
United States. All accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined
herein shall have the meanings given to them under GAAP, unless otherwise
expressly stated. The terms "third party," "third-party" or "third parties"
refers to Persons other than the Buyer and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company and the Company Stockholder Representative, on the other hand. The
drafting and negotiation of the representations, warranties, covenants and
conditions to the obligations of the Company, the Buyer and Merger Sub herein
reflect compromises, and certain provisions may overlap with other provisions
or may address the same or similar subject matters in different ways or for
different purposes. It is the intention of the parties that, to the extent
possible, unless provisions are by their terms mutually exclusive and effect
cannot be given to both or all such provisions, (i) the representations,
warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement shall be
construed to be cumulative, (ii) each representation, warranty, covenant and
closing condition in this Agreement shall be given full separate and
independent effect, and (iii) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
no limitation in or exception to any representation, warranty, covenant or
closing condition shall be construed to limit or apply to any other
representation, warranty, covenant or closing condition unless such limitation
or exception is expressly made applicable to such other representation,
warranty, covenant or closing condition. All remedies, either under this
Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, shall be cumulative and not
alternative.

 

9.16 _Waiver of Conflict_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates that the Company is the client of Goodwin Procter LLP
(" _Firm_ "), and not any of the Company Stockholders. After the Closing, it
is possible that Firm will represent the Company Stockholders, the Company
Stockholder Representative and their respective Affiliates (individually or
collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein, or in the Escrow Agreement, the escrowed funds described
in _Section 1.8 _hereof, any claims made thereunder pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby agree that Firm (or any successor) may represent the Seller Group in
the future in connection with issues that may arise under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the administration of the escrowed funds described in
_Section 1.8_ hereof and any claims that may be made thereunder pursuant to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Firm (or any successor) may serve as
counsel to all or a portion of the Seller Group or any director, member,
partner, officer, employee, representative, or Affiliate of the Seller Group,
in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement,

 



\- 82 -   the Escrow Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement. Each of the Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company consents
thereto, and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each such
party shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representations. Each of the Buyer, the Merger Sub
and the Company acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that
it has been carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted with
counsel or have been advised they should do so in this connection.
Communications between the Company and Firm will become the property of
the Company Stockholder Representative and the Company Stockholders following
the Closing and will not be disclosed to the Buyer or Merger Sub without the
prior written consent of the Company Stockholder Representative.
