liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); (c)
YODLE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"); and (d) SHAREHOLDER

its capacity as the Stockholders' Representative. Certain other capitalized
terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit .

forth herein.

B. The Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have each (i)
determined that the Merger (as defined below) is advisable and (ii) approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

C. The Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub are each recommending
to their respective stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement

D. The Company expects that within three (3) business days of the execution of
this Agreement, the Requisite Stockholder Vote (as defined below) evidenced by
an executed consent will be obtained adopting and approving this Agreement.

AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

| 
---|--- 

Section 1.

|

DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION 

1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the
DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company
will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation").

1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

1.3 Closing. The consummation of the Transactions (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Cooley LLP, 1114 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New
York 10036, at 10:00 a.m. local time on a date to be mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Company, which date shall be no later than the second (2nd)
business day after all of the conditions set forth in Section 7 of this
Agreement have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which, by
their terms, are intended to be satisfied at the Closing). The date on which
the Closing actually takes place is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Closing Date."

1.4 Effective Time. At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a
certificate of merger substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (the
"Certificate of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings
required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as Parent
and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time:

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to substantially conform to
Exhibit C;

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to substantially conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and as set forth on Exhibit
D; and

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the individuals identified on Exhibit E.

1.6 Merger Consideration.

(a) Certain Definitions. Definitions used in this Agreement can be found on
Exhibit A which is incorporated herein by this reference.

(b) Calculation of the Merger Consideration. The "Merger Consideration" shall
equal an aggregate amount in cash determined as follows:

(i) $342,000,000;

(ii) plus, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount of any Cash of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time;



(iii) minus, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount of the Company
Transaction Expenses to the extent not paid prior to the Closing; and 

(iv) minus, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount of the Company Debt;

(v) minus, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount of payments to be made
pursuant to the Company's 2015 bonus plan and the amount of payments payable
under the Retention Bonus Agreements, in each case if such payments have not
been made prior to the Closing; and

(vi) plus or minus, the Closing Adjustment determined in accordance with
Section 1.7(a) below.

The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted pursuant to Sections 1.7 and 8, if
necessary.

1.7 Merger Consideration Price Adjustment.

(a) Closing Adjustment.

(vii) At least five (5) business days before the Closing, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to Parent a statement setting forth its good faith
estimate of Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"),
which statement shall contain an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of
the Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein), a calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement"), and a certificate of the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company that the Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement
was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting
methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that
were used in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements for the most
recent fiscal year end as if such Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement
was being prepared and audited as of a fiscal year end.

(viii) The "Closing Adjustment" shall be an amount equal to the Estimated
Closing Working Capital plus $35,200,000. If the Closing Adjustment is a
positive number, the Merger Consideration shall be increased by the amount of
the Closing Adjustment pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(vi). If the Closing
Adjustment is a negative number, the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by
the amount of the Closing Adjustment pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(vi).

(b) Post-Closing Adjustment.

(i) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to
the Stockholder's Representative a statement setting forth its calculation of
Closing Working Capital, which statement shall contain an audited balance
sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to the
transactions contemplated herein), a calculation of Closing Working Capital
(the "Closing Working Capital Statement") and a certificate of the Chief
Financial Officer of Parent that the Closing Working Capital Statement was
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting methods,
practices, principles, 

policies and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of
the Audited Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year end as if
such Closing Working Capital Statement was being prepared and audited as of a
fiscal year end.

(ii) The post-closing adjustment shall be an amount equal to the Closing
Working Capital minus the Estimated Closing Working Capital (the "Post-Closing
Adjustment"). If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, the Merger
Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number, the Merger
Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Adjustment.

(c) Examination and Review.

(i) Examination. After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement, the
Stockholders' Representative shall have 30 days (the "Review Period") to
review the Closing Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, the
Stockholders' Representative and the Stockholders' Representative's
Accountants shall have full access to the books and records of the Company,
the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Parent and/or Parent's
Accountants to the extent that they relate to the Closing Working Capital
Statement and to such historical financial information (to the extent in
Parent's possession) relating to the Closing Working Capital Statement as the
Stockholders' Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of
reviewing the Closing Working Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of
Objections (defined below), provided, that such access shall be in a manner
that does not interfere with the normal business operations of Parent or the
Company.

(ii) Objection. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the
Stockholders' Representative may object to the Closing Working Capital
Statement by delivering to Parent a written statement setting forth the
Stockholders' Representative's objections in reasonable detail, indicating
each disputed item or amount and the basis for the Stockholders'
Representative's disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Objections"). If
the Stockholders' Representative fails to deliver the Statement of Objections
before the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Working Capital
Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in
the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by
the Stockholders' Representative. If the Stockholders' Representative delivers
the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Parent
and the Stockholders' Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such objections within 30 days after the delivery of the Statement of
Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so resolved within
the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing Working
Capital Statement with such changes as may have been previously agreed in
writing by Parent and the Stockholders' Representative, shall be final and
binding.

(iii) Resolution of Disputes. If the Stockholders' Representative and Parent
fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the
Statement of Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any
amounts remaining in dispute ("Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so
disputed, the "Undisputed Amounts") shall be 

submitted for resolution to the office of Grant Thornton LLP, or, if Grant
Thornton LLP is unable to serve, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative
shall appoint by mutual agreement the office of an impartial nationally
recognized firm of independent certified public accountants other than the
Stockholders' Representative's Accountants or Parent's Accountants (the
"Independent Accountants") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall
resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing
Adjustment, as the case may be, and the Closing Working Capital Statement. The
parties hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to
materiality. The Independent Accountants shall only decide the specific items
under dispute by the parties and their decision for each Disputed Amount must
be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the Closing
Working Capital Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively.

(iv) Fees of the Independent Accountants. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by reduction of the Merger Consideration
(through a reduction to the Second Anniversary Merger Consideration), on the
one hand, and by Parent, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the
amount actually contested but not awarded to the Stockholders' Representative
or Parent, respectively, bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by
the Stockholders' Representative and Parent.

(v) Determination by Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants
shall make a determination as soon as practicable within 30 days (or such
other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments
to the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment
shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

(d) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to Section 1.7
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration by the parties
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

1.8 Calculation and Payment of the Merger Consideration.

(a) Calculation and Determination of the Merger Consideration.

(iii) Not less than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent (I) the Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement as set forth in Section 1.7(a), (2) a
reasonably detailed statement containing the Company's good faith calculation
of the Merger Consideration (the "Closing Statement") based on the Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement and (3) the Payout Spreadsheet based on the
calculation of the Merger Consideration set forth on the Closing Statement.

(iv) During such five (5) business day period prior to the Closing (the
"Confirmation Period"), in addition to the access rights provided by Section
4.1 hereof, the Company shall (I) afford Parent through its officers,
employees and representatives (including its legal advisors and accountants)
access to the Company's books and records as and to the extent reasonably
necessary for Parent to confirm the Company's calculation of the Merger
Consideration, (I) make available to Parent the Company's employees who were
materially 

involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement, and (I) provide Parent
with any other documentation or information reasonably requested to confirm
the Closing Statement.

(v) During the Confirmation Period, the Company and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree on a Closing Statement, which Closing
Statement, as so agreed, shall be deemed to be the final "Closing Statement"
and shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties and shall not be subject
to dispute or review, other than with respect to the Post-Closing Adjustment,
if any.

(b) Payments at the Closing, First Anniversary of the Closing and the Second
Anniversary of the Closing.

(vi) At the Closing, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Company
Debt by wire transfer of immediately available funds to each of the applicable
holders;

(vii) At the Closing, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
Company Transaction Expenses by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to each of the applicable service providers;

(viii) At the Closing, Parent shall pay to the individuals and entities listed
on Exhibit F (the "Closing Date Payees"), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount equal to their applicable portion of the Closing
Merger Consideration;

(ix) At the Closing, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the
Stockholders' Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
an amount equal to the Expense Fund;

(x) Parent shall deliver to the Payments Administrator, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the balance of the Closing
Merger Consideration not paid by Parent pursuant to clauses (i) through (iv)
above, which aggregate amount shall be paid out by the Payments Administrator
to holders of Company Capital Stock in accordance with this Agreement;

(xi) On or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing (the "First
Anniversary Date"), Parent shall deliver to the Payments Administrator, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the First
Anniversary Merger Consideration, minus Active Indemnity Claim Amounts which
have been placed into the Indemnity Claims Escrow and minus any Representative
Losses payable to the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to Section
10.16(b), which aggregate amount shall not be less than zero and shall be paid
out by the Payments Administrator to holders of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with this Agreement; and

(xii) On or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing (the "Second
Anniversary Date" and together with the First Anniversary Date, the
"Anniversary Dates"), Parent shall deliver to the Payments Administrator, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Second
Anniversary Merger Consideration minus Active Indemnity 

Claim Amounts which have been placed into the Indemnity Claims Escrow and
minus any Representative Losses payable to the Stockholders' Representative
pursuant to Section 10.16(b) (except to the extent previously deducted from
the First Anniversary Merger Consideration), which aggregate amount shall not
be less than zero and shall be paid out by the Payments Administrator to
holders of Company Capital Stock in accordance with this Agreement.

(xiii) If Parent fails to deliver all or any portion of the Anniversary Merger
Consideration to the Payments Administrator on or prior to the applicable
Anniversary Date, then, interest shall accrue on the portion of the
Anniversary Merger Consideration which has not been delivered to the Payments
Administrator (less any Active Indemnity Claim Amounts which have been placed
into the Indemnity Claims Escrow) at the Specified Rate per annum, until such
unpaid amount of the applicable Anniversary Merger Consideration (plus all
accrued but unpaid interest thereon) is delivered to the Payments
Administrator to be paid out by the Payments Administrator to holders of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with this Agreement. Any interest that
accrues on the Anniversary Merger Consideration pursuant to this Subsection
1.8(b)(viii) shall be payable by Parent (through delivery of such amounts to
the Payments Administrator to be paid out to holders of Company Capital Stock
in accordance with this Agreement) quarterly, on March 31, June 30, September
30, and December 31 of any given year.

1.9 Effect on Capital Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Stock. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

(b) Conversion of Series E Preferred Stock. Each share of Company Series E
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Series E Preferred Per Share Liquidation Amount.

(c) Conversion of Series F Preferred Stock. Each share of Company Series F
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Series F Preferred Per Share Liquidation Amount.

(d) Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Common Stock. Each share of
Company Series A Preferred Stock, Company Series B Preferred Stock, Company
Series C Preferred Stock, Company Series D Preferred Stock and Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Non- 

Series E/F Closing Per Share Merger Consideration plus, when payable, the
First Anniversary Per Share Merger Consideration plus, when payable, the
Second Anniversary Per Share Merger Consideration.

(e) Adjustments. In the event that the Company, at any time or from time to
time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, declares or
pays any dividend on Company Capital Stock payable in Company Capital Stock or
in any right to acquire Company Capital Stock, or effects a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock into a greater number of shares of
Company Capital Stock, or in the event the outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or
otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Company Capital Stock, then the
amounts payable in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this
Section 1.9 shall be appropriately adjusted.

(f) Amendment to Company Certificate of Incorporation. Prior to the Closing
the Company shall amend its Certificate of Incorporation, substantially in the
form of Exhibit G hereto, to provide that the payments as described above
shall not conflict with the provisions of the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation.

1.10 Effect on Options and Warrants.

(a) Company Options.

(i) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of the Company or of any Securityholder, (A) each Company Vested In-The-
Money Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled without the payment of cash or issuance of other securities in
respect thereof from the Merger Consideration, and (B) each Company Unvested
Option that is held by a Non-Continuing Employee that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without the payment
of cash or issuance of other securities in respect thereof from the Merger
Consideration. The cancellation of a Company Vested In-The-Money Option or
Company Unvested Option as provided above shall be deemed a release of any and
all rights the holder thereof had or may have had in respect of such Company
Vested In-The-Money Option or Company Unvested Option. A Company Vested In-
The-Money Option that is exercised with a Specified Loan shall not be deemed
to have been canceled, but shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Out-Of-The-Money-Option and each
Company Unvested Option, in each case that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a Continuing
Employee shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent
Common Stock, and Parent shall assume such Company Out-Of-The-Money-Option or
Company Unvested Option in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement) of the Company Option Plan and the terms of the stock
option agreement by which such Company Out-Of-The-Money-Option or Company
Unvested Option is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock
under Company Out-Of-The-Money-Options and Company Unvested Option s assumed
by Parent shall thereupon be converted into options to purchase Parent Common
Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: 

(A) each Company Out-Of-The-Money-Option and Company Unvested Option assumed
by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company Out-Of-The-
Money-Option and Company Unvested Option assumed by Parent shall be determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject
to such Company Out-Of-The-Money-Option or Company Unvested Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding the
resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of each Company Out-Of-The-Money-Option or Company Unvested
Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share
exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Unvested
Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Option
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest
whole cent; and (D) any restriction on the exercise of any Company Out-Of-The-
Money-Option and Company Unvested Option assumed by Parent shall continue in
full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other
provisions of such Company Out-Of-The-Money-Option or Company Unvested Option
shall remain unchanged.

(iii) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company Option Plan.
Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards under the Company Option Plan,
to the extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share
reserve of the Company Option Plan as of the Effective Time (including any
shares returned to such share reserve as a result of the termination of
Company Options that are assumed by Parent pursuant to this Section 1.10(a),
except that: (a) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common
Stock; (b) all references in the Company Option Plan to a number of shares of
Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of
referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Option Exchange Ratio, and
rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock; and (c) the board of directors of Parent or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the board of
directors of the Company or any committee thereof with respect to the
administration of the Company Option Plan.

(b) Certain Actions With Respect to Options. Prior to the Closing Date, the
board of directors of the Company (or the compensation committee of the
Company, as applicable), shall take all actions as may be reasonably necessary
or required in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, the Company
Option Plan or the award agreements applicable to such Company Options to
effectuate all of the actions contemplated by this Section 1.10, including
giving the required notice under the Company Option Plan.

(c) Treatment of Company Warrants. At the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding warrant to purchase capital stock of the Company (each a "Company
Warrant") shall be cancelled without the payment of cash or issuance of other
securities in respect thereof. The cancellation of a Company Warrant as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of
any and all rights the holder thereof had or may have had in respect of such
Company Warrant. The Company shall take all actions as shall be necessary to
obtain the consent 

of any holder of a Company Warrant to the treatment such Company Warrant to
the extent such Company Warrant, absent such consent, is in conflict with this
Section 1.10(c).

1.11 Exchange of Company Stock.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Acquiom Clearinghouse LLC or, if such firm is
unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, another financial institution
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent shall be appointed to act as
Payments Administrator for the Merger (the "Payments Administrator") pursuant
to a Payments Administrator agreement (the "Payments Administrator
Agreement"), providing for, among other things, the matters set forth in this
Section 1.11. The fees and expenses of the Payments Administrator shall be
paid by the Parent, and the amount and the fees of the Payments Administrator
with respect to the distribution of the Closing Merger Consideration (but not
the distribution of the Anniversary Merger Consideration), shall be deemed
Company Transaction Expenses.

(b) After the Closing, promptly following surrender to the Payments
Administrator of a certificate representing share(s) of Company Capital Stock
(each, a "Company Stock Certificate"), or if any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof (each, an "Affidavit"), together with a duly
completed and executed letter of transmittal, substantially in the form of
Exhibit H attached hereto (a "Letter of Transmittal"), the Payments
Administrator will pay (or cause to be paid), in accordance with Section 1.9
and the Payout Spreadsheet, to the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or
Affidavit the amount payable with respect to such share(s) of Company Capital
Stock as provided in Section 1.9 and the Payout Spreadsheet, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account designated in the applicable
Letter of Transmittal. On the First Anniversary Date, the Payments
Administrator will pay (or cause to be paid), in accordance with Section 1.9,
to the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Affidavit the amount
payable with respect to such share(s) of Company Capital Stock as provided in
Section 1.9 with respect to the First Anniversary Merger Consideration (minus
the Pro Rata Portion of any Active Indemnity Claim Amounts which have been
placed into the Indemnity Claims Escrow and minus the Pro Rata Portion of any
Representative Losses payable to the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to
Section 10.16), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated in the applicable Letter of Transmittal. On the Second Anniversary
Date, the Payments Administrator will pay (or cause to be paid), in accordance
with Section 1.9, to the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Affidavit
the amount payable with respect to such share(s) of Company Capital Stock as
provided in Section 1.9 with respect to the Second Anniversary Merger
Consideration (minus the Pro Rata Portion of any Active Indemnity Claim
Amounts which have been placed into the Indemnity Claims Escrow and minus the
Pro Rata Portion of any Representative Losses payable to the Stockholders'
Representative pursuant to Section 10.16), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated in the applicable Letter of
Transmittal. At any time when the Payments Administrator receives payment of
interest on Anniversary Merger Consideration, the Payments Administrator will
pay (or cause to be paid) to the holders of such Company Stock Certificate or
Affidavit the amount payable with respect thereto, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated in the applicable Letter
of Transmittal. On or after the Effective Time, any shares of Company Capital
Stock presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any 

reason shall be promptly forwarded to the Payments Administrator and converted
into the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.9
without any interest thereon. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
their Affiliates shall be liable to any Securityholder for any amount paid to
any public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or
similar laws. Any amount remaining in the Payment Administrator's possession
that is unclaimed by Securityholders three (3) years after the Closing Date
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation for the benefit of the
Securityholders entitled to such amounts, subject to applicable escheat laws.

1.12 Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, holders
of Company Stock Certificates that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Legal
Requirements, and the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to all shares of such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of the Company
Capital Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section
1.11.

1.13 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by stockholders of the Company who shall have
not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall
have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration.
Such stockholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment from the
Company of the appraised value of such shares of Company Capital Stock held by
them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.13(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) his or her appraisal rights, then, as of the later of
the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares of
Company Capital Stock shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital Stock to which such
stockholder would otherwise be entitled under Section 1.9, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing such
shares or submission of an Affidavit.

1.14 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger
Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name
of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

1.15 Withholding Rights. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Effective Time 

Holder such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold therefrom with
respect to the payment of such consideration under the Code or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax or other Legal Requirement. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by or on behalf of Parent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Effective Time Holders in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. If amounts are not deducted or withheld from
consideration payable under this Agreement and a Taxing Authority later
asserts that such amounts should have been so deducted or withheld, the
Effective Time Holder to whom such consideration was paid shall be liable for
payment of such amounts and shall indemnify Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Company) and agents for any amounts imposed by such Taxing
Authority, other than any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto.
Further, Parent shall be entitled to withhold from the Closing Merger
Consideration payable to a holder of Company Common Stock by virtue of such
holder's exercise of a Company Vested In-The-Money Option with a Specified
Loan the amount of such Specified Loan.

1.16 Parent's Obligations. So long as Parent shall have made the payments and
deposits required pursuant to Section 1.8(b) at the times and to the
recipients provided in such Section 1.8(b), the parties understand and agree
that neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
liability to any Person for any errors or omissions in the allocation or
subsequent disbursement of such portion of the Merger Consideration by the
Payments Administrator or Stockholders' Representative, as applicable.

Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the statements contained
in this Section 2 are true and correct, except as expressly set forth on the
Disclosure Schedule delivered separately hereto and simultaneously herewith
(the "Disclosure Schedule"). The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained
in this Section 2, and the information disclosed in any numbered or lettered
part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify the particular representation
or warranty set forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered section in
this Section 2 and shall not be deemed to relate to or to qualify any other
representation or warranty. For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or
other item of information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule or Disclosure
Supplement shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty made by the
Company in this Section 2.

2.1 Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Legal Requirements of its jurisdiction
of incorporation. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except as set forth on Section 2.1 of the
Disclosure Schedule or such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
or licensed or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent
true and complete copies of (a) the Company Charter and its bylaws as
currently in effect, (b) the stock ledger of the Company, and (3) except as
set forth in Section 2.1 of the Disclosure Schedule, the minutes of the
meetings (including any actions taken by written 

consent without a meeting) of the stockholders of the Company, the board of
directors of the Company and all committees of the board of directors of the
Company. There has not been any violation of any of the provisions of the
Company Charter or bylaws, and the Company has not taken any action that is
inconsistent in any material respect with any resolution adopted by the
Company's stockholders, the Company's board of directors or any committee of
the Company's board of directors. The stock ledger and minute book of the
Company are accurate, up-to-date and complete in all material respects, and
have been maintained in accordance with prudent business practices.

2.2 Corporate Authorization.

and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions are within the
Company's corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the
Company's stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency and other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights in general and to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or an
action at law).

unanimously determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are advisable,
unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement and the Transactions and
unanimously resolved to recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement by

list of each Subsidiary of the Company and its place and form of organization.

of incorporation. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
heretofore delivered to Parent true and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation of each Subsidiary of the Company and their respective bylaws as
currently in effect.

the Company, as applicable: (i) its authorized capital stock, voting

the Company Warrants identified and set forth on Section 2.4 of the Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date hereof, there are no options, warrants, calls,
rights, convertible securities, commitments or agreements of any character,

Transactions.

2.6 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions do not and will not
(a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the Company Charter or bylaws of the Company, (b) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 2.5, contravene, conflict
with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Legal
Requirement, (c) except as set forth on Section 2.6 of the Disclosure Schedule

Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014,
and the related audited statements of operations and cash flows for the years

Financial Statements" and together with the Unaudited Financial Statements,
the "Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently followed throughout the periods indicated,
except for the absence of footnotes in the case of the Unaudited Financial
Statements. The Financial Statements present fairly the financial position of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of their respective dates and the
statements of operations and cash flows for the respective periods then ended,
subject, in the case of the Unaudited Financial Statements, to normal year-end
adjustments and such other adjustments as are set forth on Section 2.7(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule.

are customary and adequate for a company at the same stage of development as
the Company and that are designed to (i) provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of the Financial Statements and (ii) in a timely
manner accumulate and communicate to the Company's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer the type of information that is required to be
disclosed in the Financial Statements. None of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of their respective
employees, auditors, accountants or representatives has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any written complaint, allegation, assertion or

independent of the Company and its management.

2.8 Liabilities. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have any liabilities
of a type required to be shown on the Financial Statements in accordance with

Most Recent Balance Sheet; (c) those incurred pursuant to or in connection
with the execution, delivery 

or performance of this Agreement; (d) liabilities that can be determined by
the terms and conditions expressly set forth on the face of Material
Contracts, Company Option Plan or other contracts that have been made
available to Parent; (e) other undisclosed liabilities that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company, or that are covered by insurance policies pursuant to which full
recovery (subject to applicable deductibles and retentions) is reasonably to
be expected; or (f) set forth on Section 2.8 of the Disclosure Schedule.

2.9 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as set forth on Section 2.9 of the

the Company's Knowledge, all leases of such real property are in good standing
and are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, and there does not exist under any such lease any material breach by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any event known to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that with notice or lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Section 2.10(b) of the Disclosure Schedule describes each item of personal

obtained ownership of all such Technology and all associated rights in and to
any Intellectual Property therein (other than certain pre-existing,
background, and underlying Intellectual Property ("Background IP") in such

exclusive license of or exclusive right to use, or authorized the retention of
any exclusive rights to use or joint ownership of, any Company Owned
Intellectual Property and (ii) the Company is not bound by, and no Company
Owned Intellectual Property is subject to, any Contract containing any
covenant or other provision that in any way limits or restricts the ability of
the Company to use, exploit, assert, or enforce any Company Owned Intellectual
Property anywhere in the world.

(g) All Company Owned Intellectual Property was developed, conceived, reduced
to practice, written and/or created solely by either (i) employees of the
Company acting 

within the scope of their employment who have validly, unconditionally and
irrevocably assigned all of their rights, including all rights in and to all
Intellectual Property therein, to the Company (including a waiver of non-
assignable, "moral" rights associated with copyrightable works) or (ii) third
parties who have validly, unconditionally and irrevocably assigned all of
their rights, including all rights in and to all Intellectual Property therein
(excluding any Background IP, with respect to which Company possesses valid
irrevocable, perpetual, and royalty-free licenses), to the Company, and no
third Person owns or has any ownership rights to any of the Company Owned
Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, no employee (x) is in
breach of any Contract relating to employment, invention disclosure, invention
assignment, non-disclosure or non-competition or any other Contract with any
other party or with any former employer or other Person concerning rights in
or to Intellectual Property or confidentiality due to their activities as an
employee, or (y) has developed any Technology or Intellectual Property for the
Company that is subject to any agreement under which such employee has
assigned or otherwise granted to any third Person any rights in respect
thereof.

(h) The Company Owned Intellectual Property and the Company Licensed-In
Intellectual Property constitute all of the rights in and to Intellectual
Property that is material to and necessary for the conduct of the Business of
the Company as it currently is conducted and as it is reasonably contemplated
to be conducted after Closing, including the design, development, marketing,
manufacture, use, import and sale of any Company Product (including Company
Products currently under development); provided, however, that the parties
acknowledge and agree that this Section 2.14(h) does not address the
infringement, misappropriation, dilution or violation of any Intellectual
Property of any Person, and that those matters are addressed exclusively in
Section 2.14(l) below.

(i) Except as set forth in Section 2.14(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Contracts pursuant to which the Company licenses any Company Licensed-In
Intellectual Property will terminate solely by the passage of time within one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date.

(j) Except as set forth in Section 2.14(j) of the Disclosure Schedule, there
are no Contracts between the Company and any other Person with respect to
Company Owned Intellectual Property under which, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there is any material dispute pending or threatened in writing
regarding the scope of such Contract, or performance under such Contract,
including with respect to any payments to be made or received by the Company
thereunder.

Company's Products, infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate any
Intellectual Property right of any other Person or (ii) challenges the

Intellectual Property or the Company's ownership thereof (including any
oppositions, reexaminations or interference proceedings, infringement actions,

threatened in writing, against any third Person by the Company or its

Intellectual Property and, to the Company's Knowledge, no third Person is
engaging in any activity that infringes, misappropriates, dilutes or otherwise
violates any of Company's and/or any of its Subsidiaries' rights in and to
Company Owned Intellectual Property. The parties acknowledge and agree this
Section 2.14(l) does not apply to any Person's allegation that, in connection
with, but separate from, an end user's use of a Company Product, such end user
infringes, misappropriates, dilutes, or otherwise violates any Intellectual
Property right (so long as the alleged infringement, misappropriation,
dilution or other violation is attributable to the end user's products,
services, acts or omissions, or provision of user generated content, and not
attributable to such end user's use of any Company Product).

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB 

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

3.2 Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub have the
corporate power and authority to perform their obligations under this
Agreement; and the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger
Sub of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of Parent and Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors. No
vote of Parent's stockholders is needed to approve the Merger. This Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against them in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights in general and to general principles of equity (regardless
of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or an action at law).

3.3 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and each of the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party require no action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Body, other than (a) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the secretary of state of Delaware and appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company
does business; (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act
and any applicable foreign Antitrust Laws; (c) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and any other applicable
U.S. state or federal securities laws; and (d) any actions or filings the
absence of which would not be reasonably expected to materially impair the
ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions.

3.4 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by each of
Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions do not and will not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of any provision of any of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub or any contract or agreement
binding on Parent or Merger Sub, or (b) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 3.3, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation

other things, provide certain additional loans and advances as set forth
therein. The aggregate 

net proceeds of such loans and advances, when funded in accordance with the
terms of the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Amendment (as so amended, the
"Amended Agreement") will be sufficient, together with the Company's and
Parent's cash on hand, to enable Parent to pay the entire Purchase Price and
consummate the transactions in accordance with this Agreement. The Amendment
and the Credit Agreement are in full force and effect as of the date hereof
and no material default or event of default exists thereunder as of the date
hereof. "Credit Agreement" shall mean that certain Credit Agreement, dated as

Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. To the Knowledge of Parent, No
Event of Default (as that term is defined in the Amended Agreement) has

not any requirement for the giving of notice, the lapse of time, or both, has

Closing and the public announcement (if any) of the Merger, the Stockholders'
Representative shall be permitted to publicly announce that it has been
engaged to serve as the Stockholders' Representative in connection herewith as

respect to the Merger, any of the other Transactions or any filings, forms and
submissions filed with, or any investigations conducted by or before, any
Governmental Body relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
Transactions (including any proceedings initiated by a private party), then
such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make (or cause to be made)
as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, and only after reasonable
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and coordinate
with each other in connection with the preparation and filing of any and all

(f) Each of Parent and the Company shall keep the other party reasonably and
promptly informed of any and all written and material oral communications from
any Governmental Body regarding the Merger, any of the other Transactions and
any and all filings, forms and submissions filed with, and any and all
investigations conducted by or before, any Governmental Body relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any other Transactions (including any proceedings
initiated by a private party). Each of Parent and the Company (I) shall
provide the other party (or its counsel, pursuant to an appropriate joint
defense and confidentiality agreement) a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any written or material oral communications proposed to be given by
such party to any Governmental Body regarding the Merger, any of the other
Transactions and any and all filings, forms and submissions filed with, and
any and all investigations conducted by or before, any Governmental Body

party reasonable advance notice of any meetings proposed to be held with any
Governmental Body regarding the Merger, any of the other Transactions and any
and all filings, forms and submissions filed with, and any and all
investigations conducted by or before, any Governmental Body relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any other Transactions (including any proceedings
initiated by a private party), provided, however, that materials can be
entirely withheld if they relate to the valuation of the transaction or where
sharing the information would, in the good faith belief of the party whose
material it is, be prohibited by law or violate contractual obligations, (I)
shall consult with the other party a reasonable time in advance of any and all
such meetings and consider in good faith the views of such other party
regarding the matters to be presented and discussed at any and all such
meetings, and (I) to the extent permitted by the applicable Governmental Body,
shall allow the other party to participate in such meetings or portions
thereof. Each of Parent and the Company shall consult and cooperate with one
another, provide one another with a reasonable advance opportunity to review
and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions, proposals or other written communications explaining or
defending the Merger and other Transactions made or submitted by or on behalf
of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws.

(g) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(I) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act and all 

other applicable Antitrust Laws as soon as reasonably practicable, and (I)
take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all
things reasonably necessary or advisable to obtain all clearances, consents
and approvals necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a)
and otherwise consummate the Merger in compliance with applicable Antitrust
Laws, including taking all such reasonable actions and doing all such things
reasonably necessary to (I) resolve any objections, if any, as the FTC, the
DOJ, or any other Governmental Body may assert under any applicable Antitrust
Laws with respect to the Merger and other Transactions, and (I) avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Antitrust Laws that
may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental
Body or Persons with respect to the Merger and other Transactions so as to
enable the Merger and other Transactions to be consummated as soon as possible
after the date hereof, provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement or in any Transaction Document to the
contrary, in connection with efforts to enable the Merger and other
Transactions to be consummated, the Parent and its Affiliates shall not be
required to, and the Company and its Affiliates may not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, sell, divest, encumber, hold separate, transfer or
dispose of, before or after the Closing, any assets, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interest therein of the Parent, the Company, or
of any of their respective Affiliates (or consent to any of the foregoing
actions). Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall the Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into or
publicly announce an agreement to form a joint venture or acquire any assets,
business or company if any such agreements, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonable be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1(a) to fail to be satisfied prior to the scheduled Closing Date.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

5.1 Updates to Disclosure Schedules. The Company shall have the right to
supplement the Disclosure Schedules prior to the Closing to reflect any and
all events, circumstances or changes which arise or become known to the

Disclosure Supplement shall be in writing and shall be delivered in accordance
with the procedure set forth for notice in Section 10.5. The Disclosure

best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Credit Agreement and the Amendment,
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to, and within the
control of, Parent in the Amended Agreement, and (iii) assert its rights under
the Amended Agreement in a timely and diligent manner to cause the lenders
party thereto to perform their obligations under such Amended Agreement. 

(d) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of Company, (A) permit
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, the Amendment or the Amended Credit Agreement if such amendment,
modification or waiver would reasonably be expected to (i) prevent the Closing
Date and payment of the Merger Consideration from occurring, or (ii)
materially and adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against other parties to the Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement as so
amended or modified, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against such other parties to the Amendment or the Amended Credit Agreement as
in effect on the date hereof. Parent shall promptly (but in any event within
two (2) days of execution of any such amendment, modification or waiver)
deliver to the Company copies of any such executed amendment, modification or
waiver.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent's
obligations to effect the Merger or otherwise consummate the Transactions are
not subject to Parent obtaining the Financing or any debt, equity or other
financing.

5.3 Cooperation with Financing. Upon request of Parent, the Company shall
provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to Parent in connection with the
arrangement of the financing contemplated by the Amended Agreement; provided,
that (A) all material, non-public information regarding the Transactions, the
Group Companies or their respective Affiliates provided to Parent or any other
Person pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall be kept confidential by them in
accordance with the terms of any confidentiality agreement, and (B) none of
the Group Companies or their respective Affiliates shall be required to (i)
commit to take any action (including the entry into any agreement) that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing
that would otherwise subject any of them to actual or potential liability or
fee, cost or expense or (ii) take any action to the extent that it would, in
Company' reasonable, good faith judgment, (x) unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of Company or their Affiliates, (y) violate any
applicable law or (z) be reasonably likely to result in the waiver of any
attorney-client privilege, the unauthorized disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or the breach of any applicable confidentiality obligations;
provided, further, that Parent shall promptly upon request by Company (but in
any event within twenty (20) days of receipt of such request), reimburse
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third party costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees) incurred by
Company and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,
member of management, employees and other Representatives in connection with
the cooperation contemplated by this Section 5.3.

5.4 Tax Matters.

(i) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns for the Company required to be filed after the Closing
Date, and shall timely remit, or cause to be remitted, to the appropriate
Governmental Body all Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns, subject to its
right to be indemnified for Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
pursuant to Section 5.4(d) and Section 8. To the extent such Tax Returns
include any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (i) such Tax Returns shall be prepared
consistent with the past practices of the Company, as applicable, in all
material respects, except as otherwise required by applicable law, (ii) Parent
shall provide any such Tax Returns to the Stockholders' Representative for its
review and comment 

at least twenty (20) business days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return and (iii) Parent shall not file any such Tax Returns without prior
written consent of the Stockholders' Representative, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(j) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
substantially similar Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this
Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be borne fifty percent (50%)
by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Company securityholders (except
Parent shall be responsible for any stamp transfer tax arising pursuant to the
laws of the State of New York). The party responsible under applicable law for
filing any necessary Tax Returns or other documentation with respect to all
such Transfer Taxes shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes, and the other
party agrees to cooperate in the filing of such Tax Returns and other
documentation, including promptly supplying any information in its possession
that is reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Returns and other
documentation. Each party (other than the Stockholders' Representative) shall
indemnify and hold harmless a paying party from and against all Losses or
amounts paid by such party in excess of such party's proportional share, as
described in the first sentence of this Section 5.4(b), of the Transfer Taxes.

(k) The parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by another party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The parties agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if Parent so requests, the Company its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
shall allow Parent to take possession of such books and records.

(l) Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders' Representative in writing
upon receipt by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates of a
written notice of any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding with
respect to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which the Company
Indemnifying Parties may have liability pursuant to this Section 5.4(d) or
Section 8.1 (a "Tax Contest"); provided, that no failure or delay by Parent to
provide such notice of a Tax Contest shall reduce or otherwise affect the
obligation of the Company Indemnifying Parties hereunder except to the extent
the Stockholders' Representative is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby. Parent shall be entitled to control any Tax Contest; provided, that
(i) the Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to participate in such
Tax Contest at the sole expense of the Company Indemnifying Parties, (ii)
Parent shall keep the Stockholders' Representative reasonably informed
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest and (iii)
Parent shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest without obtaining
the Stockholders' 

Representative's prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(m) Subject to Section 5.4(a), Parent shall not, and shall not cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend any Tax Returns filed with
respect to any Tax year ending on or before the Closing Date or with respect
to any Straddle Period, make or change any Tax election or accounting method
or practice that has retroactive effect to any such Tax year or to any
Straddle Period, take any action that would extend or waive the applicable
statute of limitations for any Taxes or Tax Return for any period ending on or
before the Closing Date, make a voluntary disclosure to a Taxing Authority, or
take any other similar action, or omit to take any action, relating to the
filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax, if such action or omission
would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability of the Company
Indemnifying Parties in a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of a Straddle
Period that is attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each such case
without the prior written consent of the Stockholders' Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(n) Each Company Indemnifying Party will, severally, indemnify and defend the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, Parent, and each Affiliate of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries and Parent, and hold them harmless from
and against any Loss, claim, Liability, expense, penalty or other damage
attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (ii) any liability
for Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of
any of them) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar
state, local or foreign law or regulation, (iii) all Taxes of any Person
imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or
successor, by Contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation as the
result of transactions or events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date,
and (iv) all Transaction Payroll Taxes, in each case except to the extent such
Tax was taken into account as a Current Liability in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital; provided, however, that the Company Indemnifying
Parties shall have no obligation to indemnify and defend the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, Parent, or any Affiliate of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent against any Loss, claim, Liability, expense, penalty or
other damage attributable to Taxes resulting from (x) a Code Section 338
election with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y)
any transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the
ordinary course of business (other than as explicitly contemplated by this
Agreement), or (z) any breach by Parent of Section 5.4(e). For the avoidance
of doubt, (i) Parent will have no right to recover twice for the same amount,
and (ii) indemnification for any amount covered by this Section 5.4(f) will be
governed by the provisions of Section 8.

5.5 No Additional Warranties or Representations. Parent, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other Person
has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the
accuracy and completeness of any information regarding the Company or the
Business, which has been communicated, furnished or made available to Parent
or Merger Sub or their respective Representatives, except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any other Person shall have
or be subject to any Liability to any other 

Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or its Representatives, or
any of the Parent's or its Representatives' use of, any such information,
documents or material made available to any of them in Records stored on
computer disks, in online or physical "data rooms," provided during management
presentations or in any other forms in expectation of the Transactions except
as set forth in the Transaction Documents. Parent, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor any of its
Representatives has relied, and none of such Persons is relying, upon any
statement, warranty or representation (whether written or oral) not made in
this Agreement.

SECTION 6.

|

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS 

6.1 Preservation of Records. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, preserve and keep the Records held by them relating to the
Business for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date (or longer if
required by applicable Legal Requirements) and shall make such records (or
copies) and reasonably appropriate personnel available, at reasonable times
and upon reasonable advance notice, to any Effective Time Holder as may be
reasonably required by such party in connection with any Legal Proceedings or
Tax audits against, governmental investigations of, compliance with legal
requirements by, or the preparation of financial statements of, the Effective
Time Holders or any of their Affiliates.

6.2 Cooperation. The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and shall
cause their respective Representatives to cooperate with each other following
the Closing to ensure the orderly transition of the ownership of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and the Business to Parent and to minimize any disruption
to the Business that might result from the Transactions.

6.3 DandO Indemnification. For a period of six (6) years following the Closing,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect in the
Surviving Corporation's and its Subsidiaries' organizational documents the
provisions regarding limitation of liability and indemnification of current or
former directors, officers and employees, and trustees or administrators of
Company Employee Plans, and the advancement of expenses incurred contained in
the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents or
separate agreements, as applicable, immediately prior to the Closing and shall
honor and fulfill to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law such
limitation of liability and indemnification obligations. Subsequent to the
Closing, Parent also agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries to indemnify and advance expenses to current or former directors,
officers and employees of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each such
Subsidiary, and trustees or administrators of Company Employee Plans, to the
same extent as provided in the preceding sentence.

6.4 Employee Matters.

(g) As of the Effective Time, all Employees shall become employees of the
Surviving Corporation at the same base salary and bonus opportunity, but
excluding future equity awards, in effect immediately prior to Closing and at
a level of benefits substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. All such Employees who
continue their employment with the Company or its Affiliates from and after
the Effective Time are referred to herein as "Continuing Employees." From and
after the Closing, Parent shall (i) pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Continuing Employees any and all bonuses, compensation and 

wages that have accrued but have not been paid for all periods prior to the
Effective Time (including any and all wages and bonuses provided such amounts
are reflected in Closing Working Capital); and (ii) continue to be obligated
to comply, in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements, with all
contractual rights owed to the Continuing Employees and perform all
obligations of the Company with respect to the Continuing Employees.

(h) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and
cause any new benefit plans in which Continuing Employees may be eligible to
participate to treat (except where a third party provider forbids such
crediting of service, which is not currently anticipated, and except with
respect to any supplemental pension plan), following the Closing (each, a
"Parent Plan"), the service of Continuing Employees with the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company (or any predecessor entity thereof) attributable to
any period before the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting, applicability of minimum waiting periods for
participation, and vacation and other benefit accrual, but excluding benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan and eligibility for retiree
welfare benefit plans; provided, however, that no such crediting of service
shall result in the duplication of benefits with respect to the same time
period. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall make reasonable
commercial efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations,
eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any Parent
Plan to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents, to the extent waived or satisfied under the corresponding plan in
which the Continuing Employees participated immediately prior to the
transition to any Parent Plan, and any deductibles paid by the Continuing
Employees in the plan year in which the transition to the new Parent Plan
occurs shall be credited towards deductibles under such new Parent Plans.
Parent will cooperate with the Company, and assume all costs, in respect of
consultation obligations and similar notice and bargaining obligations owed to
any Employees or consultants of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements and bargaining
agreements, if any.

(i) Subject to this Section 6.4 hereof, Parent shall have sole discretion with
respect to the determination as to whether or when to terminate, merge or
continue any employee benefit plans and programs of the Company; provided,
however, that Parent shall continue to maintain such employee benefit plans
and programs of the Company (other than stock based plans) until the
Continuing Employees are permitted to participate in the plans and programs of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with this Section 6.4. Prior
to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing no later than ten
(10) business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the
Company 401(k) Plan to be terminated no later than the day immediately
preceding the day of the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests
that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated in accordance with the terms of the
immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall provide Parent with
resolutions terminating the Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of
which shall be subject to reasonable review and approval by Parent). Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit each such Continuing
Employee who has received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in
Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Company 401(k) Plan to roll such
eligible rollover distribution (including, for a reasonable period of time
following the Effective Time, any associated loans) into an account under a
401(k) plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries. 

(j) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to be obligated to
perform, in accordance with their terms, all contractual rights of Continuing
Employees of the Company, including but not limited to (i) the Retention Bonus
Agreements and (ii) any option agreements assumed pursuant to Section 1.10
(collectively, the "Change of Control Arrangements"). For purposes of the
Change of Control Arrangements, Parent acknowledges that the Closing will
constitute a "Change of Control."

(k) The Company shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
the right to any payments that could reasonably be expected to constitute a
"parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (each, a "Parachute
Payment") shall have been irrevocably waived by each of the applicable
"disqualified individuals" (as defined under Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder) and (ii) submit for approval, in
conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder (the
"280G Stockholder Vote"), any Parachute Payments. The disclosure and documents
that comprise the 280G Stockholder Vote shall be prepared in cooperation with
Parent and reflect all reasonable comments of Parent thereon.

(l) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any beneficiary or dependent thereof.

6.5 DandO Liability Insurance. For a period of at least six (6) years following
the Closing, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain (or
cause to be maintained), in effect, any run off (i.e., "tail") policy or
endorsement with respect to the current policy of directors' and officers'
liability insurance which the Company purchases prior to the Closing. Such
tail policy will (a) cover claims asserted within six (6) years after the
Closing arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Closing
(including consummation of the Transactions); and (b) name as insureds
thereunder all present and former directors and officers of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Company's Subsidiaries. The Company shall, and
shall be permitted to, purchase such a tail policy prior to Closing.

SECTION 8.

|

INDEMNIFICATION 

8.1 Indemnification by the Stockholders. After the Closing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Section 8, the Company Indemnifying Parties,
severally and not jointly, on a Pro-Rata basis, solely by reduction of the
Anniversary Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 1.6(b), will
indemnify and hold harmless Parent from and against, whether or not involving
a third party claim, all Losses incurred by Parent, directly or indirectly,
relating to or arising from (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty of the Company in Section 2 of this Agreement, (b) any Tax set
forth in Section 5.4(f), or (c) any payments required to be made to any
stockholder of the Company with respect to such stockholder's appraisal rights
under the DGCL ("Appraisal Rights Payments") solely to the extent such
payments are in excess of the Merger Consideration that such stockholder would
otherwise have received and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent in connection with any Legal Proceedings or
settlements in connection therewith, provided, however, that if Parent settles
any such Legal Proceedings without the Stockholders' Representative's consent,
then the cost of such settlement shall not be recoverable under this Section
8. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be
entitled to indemnification with respect to any Losses arising directly or
indirectly from any post-Closing (i) acts or omissions by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation which result in a change of facts or circumstances from
the facts and circumstances underlying the Company's representations and
warranties contained in Section 2 hereof, when such representations and
warranties were made; or (ii) changes in Legal Requirements. Under no
circumstances shall Parent be entitled to be indemnified hereunder for any
punitive, exemplary or consequential damages. 

8.2 Survival and Time Limitations. All representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of the Company in this Agreement or any other certificate or
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing. If
the Closing occurs, the Anniversary Merger Consideration shall not be reduced
with respect to any claim for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty in this Agreement or for any breach of any covenant or agreement
in this Agreement, unless Parent notifies the Stockholders' Representative in
writing of a good faith claim pursuant to this Section 8 on or before the
Survival Date. If Parent provides proper notice of a claim on or prior to the
Survival Date, liability for such claim will continue until such claim is
resolved.

8.3 Limitations on Indemnification.

(n) Parent will not be entitled to be indemnified for Losses with respect to
the matters described in Section 8.1 for any Loss until the total of all
Losses with respect to such matters, in the aggregate, exceed $1,700,000 (the
"Basket"), at which time the Anniversary Merger Consideration shall be reduced
by the amount of such Losses; provided, however, Appraisal Rights Payments
shall not be subject to or counted towards such Basket and Anniversary Merger
Consideration may be reduced immediately with respect thereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, for the period up to and including the First
Anniversary Date, the maximum reduction in the Anniversary Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 8 is limited to $30,000,000 (the
"Indemnity Cap"), and for the period commencing the day after the First
Anniversary Date and continuing until and including the Survival Date, the
maximum reduction in the Anniversary Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Section 8 is limited to $22,000,000 (and accordingly the Indemnity Cap for
such period is reduced to $22,000,000). For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall any reduction in Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 8
(individually or together with all previous reductions) exceed the then-
applicable Indemnity Cap.

(o) In addition to the foregoing limits, Parent acknowledges that from and
after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent with respect to
claims for Losses pursuant to this Section 8 shall be the reduction in the
Anniversary Merger Consideration. No amount previously paid or delivered by
the Parent hereunder shall be subject to recovery by Parent, Merger Sub, any
Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub, or any Person claiming by or through
Parent, Merger Sub, or any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub.

(p) Parent shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of
Losses subject to indemnification under this Section 8 shall be calculated
after giving effect to (i) any insurance proceeds actually received by Parent
(or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Losses, less costs incurred to
obtain such insurance proceeds, or (ii) any recoveries which may be obtained
by Parent (or any of its Affiliates) from any other third party, less costs to
obtain such recoveries.

(q) The right of Parent to reduce the Merger Consideration based on
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this Agreement shall
not be affected by any investigation conducted or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with 

respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

(r) For purposes of determining the amount of Losses subject to
indemnification under this Section 8, but not for determining whether a breach
of any representation or warranty has occurred, the representations and
warranties of the Parties in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be
qualified by any references to materiality or Material Adverse Effect.

8.4 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, this Section 8 will
provide Parent's sole and exclusive recourse and remedy for disputes relating
to or arising, directly or indirectly, from this Agreement. This Section 8
will not affect any remedy Parent may have under this Agreement prior to the
Closing or upon termination of this Agreement.

8.5 Indemnification; Claims Process.

(v) All claims for indemnification by Parent under this Section 8 shall be
brought in good faith and asserted and resolved in accordance with this
Section 8.5 and be subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in this
Section 8.

(w) If Parent intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 8,
Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders' Representative in writing of
such claim, describing such claim in reasonable detail and the amount or
estimated amount of such Losses (the "Claims Notice"); provided that, subject
to the limitations in respect of the Survival Date, the failure of Parent to
promptly notify the Stockholders' Representative shall not relieve the Company
Indemnifying Parties from liability for such claims except and only to the
extent that the Company Indemnifying Parties were actually prejudiced by such
delay.

(x) For a period of twenty (20) business days after receipt of a Claims Notice
(the "Dispute Period") in compliance with Section 8.5(a), Parent shall make no
reduction to the Anniversary Merger Consideration with respect to the Losses
alleged in such Claims Notice unless Parent shall have received written
authorization from the Stockholders' Representative to make such reduction.
After the expiration of the Dispute Period, Parent shall reduce the
Anniversary Merger Consideration by an amount equal to all or a portion of the
Losses set forth in such Claims Notice to the extent the Stockholders'
Representative has not objected in a written statement (the "Dispute Notice")
to the applicable portion of any claim or claims made in the Claims Notice,
which written statement shall include in reasonable detail the basis for such
objection, and such written statement shall have been delivered to Parent
prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period.

(y) If the Stockholders' Representative objects in writing to any portion of
the claim or claims by Parent made in any Claims Notice within the Dispute
Period, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall negotiate in good
faith for forty-five (45) days after Parent's receipt of such written
objection (the "Negotiation Period") to resolve such objection. If Parent and
the Stockholders' Representative shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties. Parent shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and Parent shall reduce
the Anniversary Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of such
memorandum. 

(z) If no such agreement can be reached during the Negotiation Period, but in
any event upon the expiration of the Negotiation Period, either Parent or the
Stockholders' Representative may bring suit in a court having competent
jurisdiction. The final non-appealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction (a "Final Order") as to the validity and amount of any claim in
such Claims Notice shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with
the Final Order and the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Indemnity
Claims Escrow in accordance therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by the
court may be entered in any other court having jurisdiction over the
applicable party.

(aa) If any claim, action, suit or proceeding that is the subject of a Claims

participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at the expense of
the Securityholders, separate from the counsel employed by Parent.

respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without
the Stockholders' Representative's prior written consent, not to be
unreasonably delayed or withheld.

8.6 Escrow Agreement. In the event that Parent does not timely pay any portion
of the First Anniversary Merger Consideration or the Second Anniversary Merger
Consideration on the date that such consideration becomes payable (each, an
"Anniversary Payment Date") as a result of an unresolved indemnity claim
pursuant to this Section 8 (such amounts, the "Active Indemnity Claims
Amounts"), the parties shall enter into an escrow agreement, substantially in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit I, with an escrow agent to be mutually
agreed upon by Parent and the Stockholders' Representative (the "Escrow Agent"
and the escrow established with such Escrow Agent, the "Indemnity Claims
Escrow"). Parent shall deposit Active Indemnity Claims Amounts into the
Indemnity Claims Escrow on the relevant Anniversary Payment Date. If Parent
fails to deposit all or any portion of the Active Indemnity Claims Amounts
into the Indemnity Claims Escrow within five (5) days of the relevant
Anniversary Payment Date, interest shall accrue on such un-deposited Active
Indemnity Claim Amounts at the Specified Rate per annum, with such interest
payable by Parent (through delivery of such amounts to the Payments
Administrator to be paid out to holders of Company Capital Stock in accordance
with this Agreement) quarterly, on March 31, June 30, September 30, and
December 31 of any given year.

and Exhibits to this Agreement.

10.15 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to

10.16 Stockholders' Representative.

(a) By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the
principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the Merger or
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the
right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each
Securityholder shall be deemed to have approved the designation of, and hereby
designates, Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the representative,
agent and attorney-in-fact of each Securityholder for the purpose of taking
all actions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Stockholders'
Representative on behalf of the Securityholders in connection with this
Agreement and the agreements contemplated hereby. If the Stockholders'
Representative shall resign or be removed by the Securityholders, the
Securityholders shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at least a
majority of the Merger Consideration), within 10 days after such resignation
or removal, appoint a successor to the Stockholders' Representative. Any such
successor shall succeed the former Stockholders' Representative as the
Stockholders' Representative hereunder.

(b) The Stockholders' Representative will incur no liability of any kind with
respect to any action or omission by the Stockholders' Representative in
connection with the its services pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements
contemplated hereby, except in the event of liability directly resulting from
the Stockholder Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholders'
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively,
"Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with the
Stockholders' Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement and
the agreements contemplated hereby, in each case as such Representative Loss
is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholders' Representative,
the Stockholders' Representative will reimburse the Securityholders the amount
of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such
gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Stockholders' Representative by the Securityholders, any such Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Stockholders' Representative from (i) the funds
in the Expense Fund and (ii) the amounts of the 

First Anniversary Merger Consideration and/or Second Anniversary Merger
Consideration at such time as such amounts would otherwise be distributable to
the Securityholders; provided, that while this section allows the
Stockholders' Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund and such future
consideration, this does not relieve the Securityholders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Stockholders' Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholders'
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Securityholders or otherwise. The Securityholders acknowledge and agree that
the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the
Stockholders' Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

(c) Upon the Closing, the Parent or Surviving Corporation will wire to the
Stockholders' Representative an amount of $1,000,000 (the "Expense Fund"),
which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Stockholders' Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The Securityholders will not
receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer
and assign to the Stockholders' Representative any ownership right that they
may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholders'
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense
Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholders' Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate
funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other
corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the
completion of the Stockholders' Representative's responsibilities, the
Stockholders' Representative will deliver the balance of the Expense Fund to
the Payments Administrator for further distribution to the Securityholders.
For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Securityholders at the time of Closing.
