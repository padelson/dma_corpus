 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 26, 2007 (this " _Agreement_
"), among Basell AF, a Luxembourg entity (" _Parent_ "), BI Acquisition
Holdings Limited, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Huntsman Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ ").

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, the Parent and
Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable, this Agreement and the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), on the
terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement;

  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements
(collectively, the " _Transactions_ ") and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger and the other Transactions; and

  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, as an
inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement and incur the
obligations set forth herein, certain of the Companys stockholders, which
beneficially or of record hold an aggregate of approximately 58.6% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, have entered into a Voting
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with Parent, pursuant to which, upon
the terms set forth therein, such stockholders have agreed to vote their
shares of Company Common Stock in favor of this Agreement and the
Transactions.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

  

 **ARTICLE I _ 
  
 THE MERGER_**

  

1.1 _The Merger; Effective Time of the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company in accordance with provisions of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). As soon as
practicable on the Closing Date, at the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ "), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger prepared and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the
Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Office
of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the date and time of the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, or such later time as agreed upon by Parent and the Company and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, the " _Effective Time_ ").

        

1.2 _Closing_. The Closing shall take place at 9:30 a.m., Houston, Texas
time, on a date that is two Business Days following the satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver in accordance with this
Agreement of the last to occur of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_
(other than (i) any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) waived in accordance with this Agreement
on the Closing Date and (ii) the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(d)_ )
(such date being, the " _First Eligible Closing Date_ ") at the offices of
Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. in Houston, Texas, or such other place as Parent and
the Company may agree in writing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the
option of the Parent (the " _Parent Closing Option_ ") the Closing may take
place on a date that is the earlier of (a) a Business Day on or after the
First Eligible Closing Date during the Marketing Period to be specified by
Parent on no less than five Business Days notice to the Company and (b) the
final day of the Marketing Period. The " _Closing Date_ " shall mean the
date on which the Closing occurs. " _Business Day_ " shall mean a day other
than a day on which banks in the State of New York or the State of Delaware
are authorized or obligated to be closed. " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean
the period commencing on the First Eligible Closing Date and ending on the
earlier to occur of (i) the 20th Business Day thereafter, and (ii) the last
Business Day prior to the Termination Date. If Parent elects to exercise the
Parent Closing Option, then from and after the First Eligible Closing Date,
the conditions in _Section 6.2(a)_ , _Section 6.2(b)_ , and _Section 6.2(e)_
shall be deemed to have been satisfied. If the Closing is scheduled to occur
on a date other than a Business Day, then the Closing shall occur on the
immediately following Business Day.

  

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company shall continue its existence under the laws of
the State of Delaware as the surviving corporation (in such capacity, the
Company is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time and
subject to _Section 5.6(b)_ , (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in its entirety in the form of
Exhibit A hereto, and, as so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall
be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and applicable law; and (b)
the Bylaws of Merger Sub shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

  

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the
directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
and such directors shall serve until their successors have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold office
until the earlier of their resignation or removal.

        

 **ARTICLE II _ 
  
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER
SUB; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

  

2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or the
holder of any of the following securities:

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and shall represent one share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that, after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Surviving Corporations common stock.

  

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

  

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _ARTICLE II_ , each share of
common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any shares of Company Common Stock described in clause (ii) of
this _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Appraisal Shares), including for the avoidance
of doubt any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (x) that were issued upon the conversion of the 5%
Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per
share (the " _5% Preferred Stock_ ") or (y) whose prior restrictions have
lapsed pursuant to _Section 2.4_ , shall be converted into the right to
receive $25.25 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall cease to
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each
holder of a certificate previously representing any such shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  

(ii) All shares of 5% Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares described in clause (iii)
of this _Section 2.1(b)_ ) shall remain outstanding and be entitled to the
rights and privileges set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company.

  

(iii) Subject to _Section 5.14_ , all shares of Company Common Stock or 5%
Preferred Stock held by the Company as treasury shares or by Parent or Merger
Sub or by any Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be canceled and
cease to exist as of the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and
no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable therefor.

  

(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc_. In the event of any change in the number
of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock (including Company
Stock Options), issued

        

and outstanding between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time by
reason of any stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the Merger
Consideration to be paid for each share of Company Common Stock (or Option
Consideration to be paid for any Company Stock Option, as the case may be) as
provided in this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action and, as so adjusted, shall, from and
after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration or the Option
Consideration, as the case may be, subject to further adjustment in
accordance with this _Section 2.1(c)_.

  

2.2 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any record holder
(excluding any shares described in _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_ ) who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ , but instead, at
the Effective Time, the holders of Appraisal Shares shall become entitled
to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL and at the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease
to exist and the holder of such shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except as set forth in this _Section 2.2_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL
or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and cease and each of such
holders Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive, without
interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall deliver prompt
notice to Parent of any notice received by the Company of intent to demand
and of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL that are received by the
Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and provide
Parent with the opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

2.3 _Treatment of Company Options_. The Company agrees that it will take
such actions as are necessary to cause at the Effective Time each option for
the purchase of Company Common Stock then outstanding (" _Company Stock
Option_ "), whether or not exercisable, under the Companys Stock
Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plan_ "), to become fully exercisable
(if not then fully exercisable), and such options shall immediately
thereafter be cancelled and shall automatically cease to exist, and each
holder of Company Stock Options shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such Company Stock Option except the right to receive the following
consideration upon delivery of an option surrender agreement, which shall be
in a form reasonably agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing
(" _Option_

        

 _Surrender Agreement_ ") in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)(i)(B)_ :  for
each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock
over (ii) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option
(such amount in cash as described above being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Option Consideration_ "). Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that the actions described in the preceding sentence shall occur at the
Effective Time without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Parent or any of
their respective stockholders.

  

2.4 _Treatment of Restricted Company Common Stock_.  Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the restrictions applicable to each share of restricted
Company Common Stock (including Company Common Stock underlying restricted
stock units and phantom stock) issued or granted pursuant to the Company
Stock Plan shall immediately lapse, and, at the Effective Time, each share of
such Company Common Stock, restricted stock units and phantom stock shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms hereof.

  

2.5 _Payment for Securities_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall enter into an agreement with an entity designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of
Company Common Stock and holders of the Company Stock Options in connection
with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger
Consideration and the Option Consideration to which such holders shall become
entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_. On the Closing Date and prior to the
filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options, for payment in accordance
with this _ ARTICLE II_ through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount
sufficient to permit payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and the aggregate Option Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and the Option Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ , in each case, out of the Payment Fund. The
Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, in
short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; provided, however, that
any interest or other income resulting from the investment of the Payment
Fund shall be solely for the account of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
 If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay
the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Stock Options shall be entitled under _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.3_
, respectively, Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause
the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit additional cash with the Paying
Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for
payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying
Agent in connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration
and the

        

cancellation of Company Stock Options for the Option Consideration. Any
interest or other income resulting from Investment of the Payment Fund shall
become part of the Payment Fund.

  

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

  

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to deliver:

  

(A) to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of
(1) an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (2) shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a customary letter of transmittal (" _Letter
of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent
and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth
in _Section 2.1(b)(i)_ ; and

  

(B) to each holder of a Company Stock Option as of the Effective Time (1) an
Option Surrender Agreement, and (2) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Company Stock Option in exchange for the Option
Consideration.

  

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or book-entry shall then be canceled.
No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to an individual, partnership, limited liability
company, corporation, joint stock company, trust, estate, joint venture,
Governmental Entity, association or unincorporated organization, or any other
form of business or professional entity (" _Person_ "), other than the Person
in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this

        

 _Section 2.5(b)(ii)_ , each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall,
subject to _Section 2.2_ , be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _ARTICLE II_.

  

(iii) Upon cancellation of a Company Stock Option, together with the delivery
of the Option Surrender Agreement, duly executed, and any other documents
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the
holder of the Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.3_.

  

(c) _Termination of Rights_.

  

(i) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Common Stock. After the close of business on the date of the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than
certificates evidencing shares described in clause (ii) of _Section 2.1(b)_ )
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates as
provided in this _ARTICLE II._

  

(ii) The cancellation of a Company Stock Option in exchange for the Option
Consideration shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder had
or may have had in respect of such Company Stock Option. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary (including
causing the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committees thereof) to
take such actions as are allowed by the Company Stock Plan) to ensure that,
following the Effective Time, without any action required by any holder of
Company Options, (A) no participant in the Company Stock Plan or any other
plans, programs or arrangements of the Company shall have any right
thereunder to acquire or otherwise receive any capital stock of, or other
equity or similar interests in, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
Affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, an "
_Affiliate_ ") thereof and (B) the Company Stock Options may be cancelled in
exchange for the Option Consideration pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

  

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest thereon) that remains undistributed to the former
stockholders or optionholders of the Company on the 365th day after the date
on which the Effective Time occurs shall be delivered to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, upon demand by either Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, and any former common stockholders or optionholders of
the Company who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration or
Option Consideration

        

to which they are entitled under this _ARTICLE II_ shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of their claim for such
amounts.

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock or
Company Stock Option for any amount of Merger Consideration or
Option Consideration, as applicable, delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Company Stock Option has not been
surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which
Merger Consideration or Option Consideration in respect of such Certificate,
Book-Entry Share or Company Stock Option would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Company
Stock Option shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other
than a Certificate evidencing shares described in clause (ii) of
_Section 2.1(b)_ ) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the amount of Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE II_.

  

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options pursuant to
this Agreement any amount required (or reasonably believed to be required) to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly
withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock or
Company Stock Options, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be.

  

 **ARTICLE III _

3.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth on

Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and except as disclosed in
the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof

and

        

"Risk Factors" sections of such Company SEC Documents and only to the extent
reasonably apparent in the Company SEC Document that such disclosed item is

each case as of the date hereof, have been furnished or made available
to Parent or its representatives, along with the most recent actuarial
valuation reports and financial statements or accounts, the most recent
summary plan description and summary of material modifications and, for
Employee Benefit Plans and the Foreign Benefit Plans intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination letter, if
any.

  

(ii) Except for such failures that would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect:

  

(A) Each Employee Benefit Plan has been maintained in compliance with its
terms and with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to ERISA, the
Code and the Pension Protection Act of 2006.

  

(B) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no actions, suits or claims
pending (other than routine claims for benefits) or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against, or with respect to, any of the Employee Benefit
Plans and Foreign Benefit Plans. (1) Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate participates in, contributes to or is otherwise liable (other than
for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ")) with
respect to, any Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 412 of the
Code, Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA, (2) no "reportable
event" within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day
notice requirement has not been waived has occurred or is expected to occur
with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, (3) no Employee Benefit Plan is a
"multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Sections 3(37) of ERISA).

   

18  

   

(C) All contributions required to be made to the Employee Benefit Plans and
Foreign Benefit Plans pursuant to their terms and applicable law have been
timely made.

  

(D) There are no unfunded benefit obligations under the Employee Benefit
Plans and Foreign Benefit Plans that have not been properly accrued for in
the Companys financial statements or disclosed in the notes thereto in
accordance with GAAP.

  

(E) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the Merger and compliance with the terms hereof (whether
alone or in combination with any other event) will not, (1) entitle any
current or former employee or director or independent contractor of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to severance pay, (2) except as
expressly required by this Agreement, accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Employee Benefit Plan
or Foreign Benefit Plan, (3) result in any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan, or (4)
cause any amounts payable under any Employee Benefit Plan (whether in cash,
in property or in the form of benefits) to fail to be deductible for federal
income tax purposes by virtue of Sections 162(m) or 280G of the Code.

  

(iii) No liability under Title IV or section 302 of ERISA has been incurred
by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full,
and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other than liability for
premiums due the PBGC (which premiums have been timely paid when due).
Insofar as the representation made in this section 3.1(l)(iii) applies to
sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, it is made with respect to
any Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a " _Title IV
Plan_ ") to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to
make, contributions during the five (5)-year period ending on the last day of
the most recent plan year ended prior to the Closing Date.

  

(iv) The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan
and no condition exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings
will be instituted.

  

(v) With respect to each Title IV Plan, the present value of accrued benefits
under such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding
purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such plans actuary
with respect to such plan did not exceed, as of its latest valuation date,
the then current value of the assets of such plan allocable to such accrued
benefits.

  

(vi) Neither the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, or Employee Benefit Plan, any
trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator thereof has

        

engaged in a transaction in connection with which the Company, any ERISA
Affiliate, any Employee Benefit Plan, or any such trust, or any trustee or
administrator thereof, or any party dealing with any Employee Benefit Plan or
any such trust could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant
to section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to section 4975
or 4976 of the Code.

  

(vii) Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts
maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the
Code. Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of
Section 501(c)(9) has satisfied such requirements.

  

(viii) No Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan provides medical,
surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured)
for employees or former employees of the Company or any Subsidiary for
periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service,
other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii) death benefits under
any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the
current or former employee (or beneficiary thereof).

  

(ix) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has (i) used the services
or workers provided by third party contract labor suppliers, temporary
employees, "leased employees" (as that term is defined in Section 414(n) of
the Code), or individuals who have provided services as independent
contractors to an extent that would reasonably be expected to result in the
disqualification of any of the Employee Benefit Plans or the imposition of
penalties or excise taxes with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans by the
IRS, the Department of Labor, or the PBGC.

  

(x) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated and
administered in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code from the
period beginning January 1, 2005 and has not been materially modified since
October 3, 2004.  There are no agreements in place that would entitle any
participant in any such plan to reimbursement for any additional tax imposed
by Section 409A of the Code.

  

(xi) With respect to the Foreign Benefit Plans, (i) the Foreign Benefit Plans
have been maintained in all material respects in accordance with their terms
and all applicable laws (including, but not limited to, all tax laws,
regulations and the European Union cross-border membership rules), (ii) if
intended to qualify for special Tax treatment, the Foreign Benefit Plans meet
the requirements for such treatment in all material respects, (iii) if
intended to be book-reserved, the Foreign Benefit Plans are fully book
reserved based upon reasonable US GAAP actuarial assumptions and methodology
and fully reflect the financial effects of all prior transactions in relation
to the book reserved Foreign Benefit Plans, (iv) if intended to be funded,
the Foreign Benefit Plans are either fully funded or any shortfall is fully
recognized as a book reserve, based upon reasonable US GAAP
actuarial assumptions and methodology and fully reflect the financial effects
of all prior transactions in relation to the funded Foreign Benefit Plans,

        

(v) there are no undisclosed outstanding disputes with respect to any
Foreign Benefit Plan and (vi) no liability which could be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exists or reasonably could be
imposed upon the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason
of such Foreign Benefit Plans (including, but not limited to any post-sale
liabilities relating to any divestiture in the United Kingdom, including
disputes and contribution notices from the Pensions Regulator), other than to
the extent reflected on the financial statements.

  

(m) _Labor Matters_.

  

(i) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(m)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, (A) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or other current labor
agreement with any labor union, works council or organization, (B) no labor
union, works council or labor organization has made a pending demand for
recognition or certification with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and there are no representation or certification proceedings or
applications seeking a representation or certification proceeding presently
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing to be
brought or filed with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor
relations tribunal or authority; and (C) the Company has no knowledge of any
labor organizing activities with respect to any employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

  

(ii) There are no pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
strikes, labor disputes, walkouts, slowdowns, work stoppages or lockouts
against or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the
knowledge of the Company, the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their respective
employees, agents or representatives have not committed any material unfair
labor practice as defined in the National Labor Relations Act or any similar
foreign, state or local law.

  

(iii) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2005
have been, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations respecting employment
and employment practices, including, without limitation, all laws and
regulations respecting terms and conditions of employment, health and safety,
wages and hours, child labor, immigration, employment discrimination,
disability rights or benefits, equal opportunity, plant closures and layoffs,
affirmative action, workers compensation, labor relations and unemployment
insurance, in each case, with respect to employees, and there are no actions,
lawsuits, claims, labor disputes, grievances, arbitrations, charges,
complaints or controversies pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, by or on behalf of
any applicant for employment, any current or former employee or any class of
the foregoing, relating to any of the foregoing applicable laws and
regulations, or alleging breach of any express or implied contract
of employment, wrongful termination of employment, or alleging any other
discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in connection with the
employment relationship, other than such matters which would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice of the intent of the Equal Employment

        

Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Department of
Labor or any other Governmental Entity responsible for the enforcement of
labor or employment laws to conduct an investigation with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which such investigation would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and no such investigation is in progress.

  

(iv) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are, and during the ninety-day
period prior to the date of this Agreement, have been in compliance with all
notice and other requirements under the Workers Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (the " _WARN Act_ ") and any similar foreign, state or local
law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental Entity relating to plant
closings and layoffs. _Schedule 3.1(m)(iv)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true and complete chart, as of the date of this Agreement,
listing any and all plant closings and mass layoffs, as such terms are
defined under the WARN Act or any similar foreign, state or local
law, ordinance or regulation, by location, relevant date(s), and number of
employees involved, which the Company or its Subsidiaries will implement or
anticipate implementing in the ninety days prior to the Closing Date, which
chart shall be updated by the Company through and until the Closing Date.

  

(v) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable are in material
compliance with Executive Order 11246.

  

(vi) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has properly classified, under applicable law, each of its
employees as employees, and each of its independent contractors as
independent contractors, and has treated each person classified by it as
an employee or independent contractor consistently with such status. There is
no proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries challenging the classification of any
person as an employee or an independent contractor, including any claim for
unpaid benefits, for or on behalf of, any such person other than such
proceedings or challenges which would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(vii) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects
withheld and reported all amounts required by law or by agreement to be
withheld and reported with respect to wages, salaries, and other payments to
employees and is not liable in any material respect for any arrears of wages,
compensation or any Taxes, penalties or other sums for failure to comply with
any of the foregoing.

  

(viii) To the Companys knowledge, no employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries is in any material respect in violation of any term of
any employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, common law
nondisclosure obligation, fiduciary duty, noncompetition agreement,
restrictive covenant or other obligation to a former employer of any such
employee relating (A) to the right of any such employee to

        

be employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (B) to the knowledge or
use of trade secrets or proprietary information.

  

(n) _Intellectual Property_.  The Company and its Subsidiaries own or have
the right to use and after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will have the right to use, pursuant to a license or
otherwise, all Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of the
businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted
(collectively, the " _Company Intellectual Property_ ") free and clear of
all Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances, except where the failure
to own or have the right to use such Intellectual Property would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, the operation of
the business of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently
conducted does not infringe upon, violate, or misappropriate any Intellectual
Property right of any other Person, except for such matters that would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. " _Intellectual Property_ " means all of the
following whether arising under the Laws of the United States or of any other
jurisdiction: (a) patents, patent applications (including patents issued
thereon) and statutory invention registrations, including reissues,
divisions, continuations, continuations in part, extensions and
reexaminations thereof, and all rights therein provided by
international treaties or conventions, (b) trademarks, service marks, trade
names, service names, trade dress, logos and other identifiers of source,
including all goodwill associated therewith, and any and all common law
rights, and registrations and applications for registration thereof, all
rights therein provided by international treaties or conventions, and all
renewals of any of the foregoing, (c) Internet domain names, (d)
copyrightable works, copyrights, moral rights, mask work rights, in each
case,  whether or not registered, and registrations and applications
for registration thereof, and all rights therein provided by international
treaties or conventions, (e) confidential and trade secret information,
including confidential information regarding inventions, processes, formulae,
models, and methodologies.

  

(o) _Personal Property_. Except as would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
Company and its Subsidiaries (A) have good, valid and marketable title to all
of the personal properties and assets, tangible and intangible, that they
purport to own, and valid leasehold interests in all of the personal
properties and assets, tangible and intangible (other than Intellectual
Property), that they purport to lease, in each case including the personal
properties and assets reflected in the Companys most recent consolidated
balance sheet included in the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2005 filed with the SEC, but excluding any
personal property or assets that are no longer used or useful for the conduct
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted or
that have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business since September
30, 2005. All such properties and assets are free and clear of all
Encumbrances, except for (i) routine statutory liens securing liabilities not
yet due and payable, (ii) minor Encumbrances that do not materially detract
from the value of the specific asset affected or the present use of such
asset, (iii) Encumbrances existing or expressly permitted pursuant to credit
facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries existing as of the date of
this Agreement or refinancings or Encumbrances permitted under _Section 4.1_
hereof (collectively, " _Permitted Encumbrances_ "); and (B) have such
ownership or such rights by license,

        

lease or other agreement to all material equipment used or necessary to

(A) The Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective operations and
assets are and, during the relevant time periods specified under all
applicable statutes of limitations, have been in compliance with
Environmental Laws, and there are no facts or circumstances known to the
Company which could reasonably be expected to form the basis of any liability
under Environmental Laws against the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any person

or assumed. The Company is not currently aware of any reasonably foreseeable
conditions or developments that could reasonably be expected to prevent the

Releases are reasonably likely to result in material liability to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under Environmental Law, and, as of the date of
this Agreement, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have received any
notice asserting an alleged liability or obligation under any Environmental
Laws with respect to the investigation, remediation, removal, or monitoring
of the Release of any Hazardous Materials or the threatened Release of any
Hazardous Materials at or from any property whether or not currently or
formerly owned or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and

  

(D) Since January 1, 1997, there have been no material environmental
investigations, studies, audits, or other analyses conducted by or on behalf
of, or that are in the possession of, the Company or its Subsidiaries
addressing potentially material environmental matters with respect to any
property owned, operated or otherwise used by any of them that have not been
delivered or otherwise made available to Parent prior to the date hereof.

  

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries own, lease, operate or
otherwise use any properties in New Jersey with respect to which the

(i) The Board of Directors of the Company and the Transaction Committee have
received the opinion of Merrill Lynch and Co. to the effect that, as of the

shareholders of Company Common Stock (other than the HMP Equity Trust) is
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

  

(ii) The Transaction Committee has received the opinion of Cowen and Company,
LLC, to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the

interests therein) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

  

(s) _Vote Required_. The affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys capital

(u) _Certain Contracts and Arrangements_.   _Schedule 3.1(u)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, together with the lists of exhibits contained in the
Company SEC Documents, sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date of
this Agreement, of: (i) each agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party (other than this Agreement) that is of a type that
would be required to be included as an exhibit to a Registration Statement on
Form S-1 pursuant to Items 601(b)(2), (4), (9) or (10) of Regulation S-K of
the SEC if such a registration statement was filed by the Company on the date
of this Agreement; (ii) any agreement that purports to limit, in any material
respect, the manner in which, or the localities in which, all or any material
portion of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
is conducted; (iii) any supply or sales agreement, service agreement or other
agreement of a similar nature of one year or greater remaining duration
having an aggregate value, or involving payment by or to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries of more than $75 million on an annual basis; (iv) any
contract or agreement relating to the borrowing of money or extension of
credit pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has a
borrowing capacity of more than $15 million or outstanding indebtedness of
more than $15 million; (v) each agreement that contains obligations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries secured by a lien (other than
Permitted Encumbrances), or interest rate or currency hedging agreements, in
each case in connection with which the aggregate actual or contingent
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under such contract are
greater than $15 million; (vi) any contract entered into after January 1,
2006 or not yet consummated, in each case for the acquisition or disposition,
directly or indirectly (by merger or otherwise), of businesses or capital
stock or other equity interests of another Person for aggregate consideration
under such contract in excess of $5 million, but excluding for purposes of
this clause (vi) any supply or sales contracts; (vii) any contract pursuant

hand, that involves amounts of more than $1 million other than employment or
compensation arrangements with directors or officers or their direct reports
(collectively, the " _Company Contracts_ "). Except as would not be

        

reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in breach or default under any Company Contract nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, is any other party to any such Company Contract in breach or default
thereunder.

  

(v) _State Takeover Statutes_.  No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "interested stockholder," "business combination", anti-takeover
or other similar statute, rule or regulation enacted under state or federal
laws in the United States (with the exception of Section 203 of the DGCL ("
_Section 203_ ")) applicable to the Company is applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other Transactions. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations made in _Section 3.2(h)_ , the action of the Board of
Directors of the Company in approving this Agreement is sufficient to render
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger, and the other Transactions the
restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203) as set
forth in Section 203.

  

(w) _Real Property_. _Schedule 3.1(w)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all
material real property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Owned Real Property_ ") and for each parcel of Owned
Real Property, contains a correct location and description of the business
purpose of such Owned Real Property. _Schedule 3.1(w)_  of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list, as of the date of this
Agreement, of all material real property leased, subleased, licensed or
otherwise occupied (whether as tenant, subtenant or pursuant to other
occupancy arrangements) by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company (collectively, including the improvements thereon, the " _Material
Leased Real Property_ "), and for each Material Leased Real Property,
identifies the location of such Material Leased Real Property. The Owned Real
Property and the Material Leased Real Property shall be referred to herein,
individually as " _Real Property_ " and, collectively, as the " _Real
Properties_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries have good, valid and
defensible title to all Owned Real Property and valid leasehold estates in
all Material Leased Real Property free and clear of all Encumbrances, except
Permitted Encumbrances, except as would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each agreement under which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is
the landlord, sublandlord, tenant, subtenant, or occupant with respect to
the Material Leased Real Property (each, a " _Material Real Property Lease_
") to the knowledge of the Company is in full force and effect and is valid
and enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and
neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of the
Company, any other party thereto, has received written notice of any default
under any Material Real Property Lease. A true, correct and complete copy of
each Material Real Property Lease has been made available to Parent prior to
the date hereof. Except as would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, there
does not exist any pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
condemnation or eminent domain proceedings that affect any of the Real
Properties.

        

(x) _Related Party Transactions_.  Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any contract, agreement or transaction with any
director, officer or Affiliate of the Company or any Affiliate of any of the
foregoing except for employment or compensation agreements or arrangements
with directors and officers and indemnity agreements or provisions in each
case made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

  

3.2 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_.  Except as
set forth on the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this Agreement and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company on or prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "), Parent and Merger Sub
jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  

(a) _Organization, Standing and Power_.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is
conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes
such qualification necessary, other than where the failure to be duly
organized, validly existing, or so to qualify or be in good standing would
not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Parent and Merger Sub each has
heretofore made available to the Company complete and correct copies of its
principle organizational documents. " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ "
means any occurrence, circumstance, condition, change, event or effect that
prevents or materially delays or impairs or is reasonably likely to prevent
or materially delay or impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Transactions.

  

(b) _Authority; No Violations, Consents and Approvals_.

  

(i) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and

enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject as to enforceability, to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law). Parent, as the owner of all of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, will immediately after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement adopt this Agreement in its
capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

        

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the Transactions will not result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
acceleration of any material obligation or the loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of
the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any
provision of (A) the principle organizational documents of Parent or Merger
Sub or any provision of the comparable charter or organizational documents of
any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B) any loan or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, permit, franchise or
license to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or their
respective properties or assets are bound or (C) assuming the consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, filings, or permits
referred to in _Section 3.2(b)(iii)_ are duly and timely obtained or made,
any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation of
any Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
clauses (B) and (C), any such violations, defaults, acceleration, losses or
Encumbrances that would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, or
filing with, or permit from, any Governmental Entity is required to be
obtained or made by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions, including the
Financing, except for: (A) the filing of a premerger notification report by
Parent under the HSR Act and the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting period with respect thereto; (B) the filing with the SEC of such
reports under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and such other

State of the State of Delaware; (D) such filings and approvals as may be
required by any foreign premerger notification or competition, securities,
corporate or other law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity set
forth on Schedule 3.2(b)(iii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter; and (E) any
such consent, approval, order, authorization, registration, filing, or permit
that the failure to obtain or would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) _Information Supplied_.  None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date mailed to stockholders of the Company or at the
time of the meeting of such stockholders to be held in connection with the
Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to the Parent or
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or other information supplied by the Parent
for inclusion therein, in the form mailed to stockholders will comply as to
form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

        

(d) _Litigation_. There are no suits, claim, actions, proceedings,
arbitrations or mediations pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or Merger Sub, other than any such suits, claims, actions,
proceedings, arbitrations or mediations that would not reasonably be likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
properties or assets is or are subject to any judgments, orders or decrees,
except for those judgments, orders or decrees that would reasonably be likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(e) _Financing_. Parent and Merger Sub (i) will have at the Effective Time
sufficient immediately available funds available and the financial ability to
permit Parent and Merger Sub to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, the
aggregate Option Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt
necessary in connection with the Transactions and fees and expenses of
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives incurred in
connection with the Transactions and (ii) at the Effective Time, will have
the resources and capabilities (financial and otherwise) to perform its
obligations hereunder. True, correct and complete copies of the
debt commitment letter dated the date of this Agreement from Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein have been provided to the Company. The Debt
Commitment Letter has been fully executed and delivered by Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. and, when the previously executed signature page of Parent and
Merger Sub is released from escrow and delivered, will be valid and
enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a preceding in equity or at law). The
obligations of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. to fund the commitment under the
Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to any conditions other than as set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, to
the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred that (with or without notice,
lapse of time, or both) would constitute a breach or default under the Debt
Commitment Letter by Parent or Merger Sub. Parent has no knowledge of any
facts or circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in (i) any of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter not being satisfied or
(ii) the funding contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter not being made
available to Parent on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any repayment or refinancing of debt
necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(f) _Solvency; Surviving Corporation After the Merger_.  Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub is entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors.  Assuming that the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct in all material
respects, at and immediately after the Effective Time, and after giving
effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, the
Surviving Corporation (i) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its
assets will not be less than the sum of its debts and that the present fair
saleable value of its assets will not be less than the amount required to pay
its probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and matured);
(ii) will have adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage in its
business; and (iii) will not have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay as
they become absolute and matured.

        

(g) _Vote/Approval Required_.  No vote or consent of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement
or the Merger or the other Transactions. The vote or consent of Parent as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which has been obtained) is the only vote
or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger
Sub necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions.

"own" (within the meaning of Section 203) or have, within the last three
years, "owned" any shares of Company Common Stock or 5% Preferred Stock.

Standards applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of their respective dates and the results of operations and the cash flows
of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods presented
therein, except that any interim financial statements are subject to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments.

the Company or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or (B)

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Board
of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may in connection with
any Takeover Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change if, after

Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may only make an
Adverse Recommendation change pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)(i)(B)_ or cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) if the Board
of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof first determines in good
faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel that
such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and further provided
that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change until after the third Business Day
following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Notice _

and specifying the reasons therefor, including the material terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action
by such Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (it being
understood and agreed that (I) any material amendment to the financial terms
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change and a new three Business Day period and (II) in
determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall take into account any
changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the
Company in response to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change or
otherwise). No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the
Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any share takeover
statute to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
4.2(a)_ and _Section 4.2(b)_ , the Company shall (i) promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of the receipt of any bona fide Takeover Proposal or
any request for information or other inquiry that the Company reasonably
believes could lead to any Takeover Proposal in each case after the date of
this Agreement and (ii) provide the material terms and conditions of any such
Takeover Proposal or other inquiry and the identity of the Person making any
such Takeover Proposal promptly (but in any event within 48 hours thereof).
 The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any
material developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal, request
for information or other inquiry (including any material changes thereto).

  

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, it being understood, however,
that this clause (ii) shall not be deemed to permit the Board of Directors of
the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or take any of the
actions referred to in clause (ii) of _Section 4.2(b)_  except, in each case,
to the extent permitted by _Section 4.2(b)_.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Companys
Board of Directors or any committee thereof shall be permitted, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, other than in connection with a
Takeover Proposal, to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but only if
prior to taking any such action, the Board of Directors of the Company (or
any committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and the Company has given
three Business Day advance notice to Parent that the Company intends to take
such action.

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any factually
accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt
of a Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto, shall not be deemed

        

to be a recommendation of such Takeover Proposal or the withdrawal, amendment
or modification of the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors or
the transaction committee thereof in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger.

  

(g) Any action pursuant to this _Section 4.2(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_
shall not constitute a breach of the Companys representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

  

(h) " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Third Party relating to (a) any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, of (i) any
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including capital stock of the
Subsidiaries of the Company that generated 15% or more of the Companys
consolidated net revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization for the preceding twelve months, or (ii) 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (b) any tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any Third Party owning, directly
or indirectly, 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or (c) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which any Third Party (or the shareholders
of any Third Party) would own, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the
voting capital stock of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or
the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such
surviving entity, other than, in each case, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. " _Company Required Vote_ " shall mean the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares in favor of adoption
of this Agreement. " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide
Takeover Proposal that if consummated would result in a Third Party (or the
shareholders of any Third Party) owning, directly or indirectly, (a) more
than 50% of the voting capital stock of the Company or of the surviving
entity in a merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company
or such surviving entity or (b) the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that generated 50% or more of the Companys consolidated net
revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for
the preceding twelve months, in either case, the Companys Board of Directors
or a committee thereof determines (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel and after taking into account relevant legal,
financial, regulatory, estimated timing of consummation and other aspects of
such proposal and the Third Party making such proposal) would, if consummated
in accordance with its terms, result in a transaction more favorable to the
Companys stockholders than the Merger. " _Third Party_ " shall mean any
Person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other
than Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliates thereof.

  

 **ARTICLE V** 
  
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

5.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

  

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement (including the preliminary Proxy
Statement) and any amendment or supplement to the preliminary Proxy
Statement. The Company shall promptly

        

prepare and file with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable a
preliminary Proxy Statement (and in any event no later than 50 days following
the date of this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
furnish such preliminary Proxy Statement to Parent and give Parent and its
legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such preliminary Proxy
Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall accept all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in connection therewith.
The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any comments of
the SEC staff with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and of any
requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall provide to Parent, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, copies of all written correspondence between the Company or any
representative of the Company and the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement. If comments are received from the SEC staff with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to the comments of
the SEC. The Company will promptly supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the Merger.  The Company shall provide Parent and its
legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review any amendment or
supplement to each of the preliminary and the definitive Proxy Statement
prior to filing with the SEC and shall accept all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested by Parent in connection therewith. Parent
shall promptly provide the Company with such information as may be required
to be included in the Proxy Statement or as may be reasonably required to
respond to any comment of the SEC staff. After all the comments received
from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC staff and all information required
to be contained in the Proxy Statement has been included therein by the
Company, the Company shall promptly file the definitive Proxy Statement with
the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed (including by electronic
delivery if permitted) as promptly as practicable, to its stockholders of
record, as of the record date established by the Board of Directors of the
Company.

  

5.2 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, agents, legal counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ "), during the period
prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section 7.1_ of this Agreement,
reasonable access, at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the
officers, key employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records, contracts and
documents and shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish
reasonably promptly to the Parent and its Representatives such information
concerning the Companys and its Subsidiaries business, properties,
contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to
time, by or on behalf of the Parent; _provided_ , that any such access
pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall be coordinated through one of the
individuals listed on _Schedule 5.2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent
and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.2_ , the Company shall not be required to, or
to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to
Parent or any of its Representatives to the extent that such information is
subject to an

        

attorney/client or attorney work product privilege or that such access or the
furnishing of such information is prohibited by law or an existing contract
or agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure under such circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not have access to personnel records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records,
medical histories or other information that in the Companys good faith
opinion on the advice of outside counsel the disclosure of which could
subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability.  Parent
agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ for any purpose unrelated
to the consummation of the Transactions. The Confidentiality Agreement dated
as of June 5, 2007 between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and,
subject to _Section 7.2_ , shall apply to all information furnished
thereunder or hereunder.

  

5.3 _Stockholders  Meeting and Board Recommendation_.  The Company shall
call, hold and convene a meeting of its stockholders to consider the adoption
of this Agreement, to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders (and in any
event no later than 45 days after the mailing of the Proxy Statement), and
the Companys obligation to call, hold, and convene such meeting in
accordance with this _Section 5.3_ shall not be affected by the withdrawal,
amendment, or modification of the recommendation by the Board of Directors of
the Company that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of adoption of
this Agreement, unless the Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_.
Subject to _Section 4.2(b) and (e)_ , (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement at the Companys stockholders meeting and the
Board of Directors of the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to
the effect that the Board of Directors of the Company has recommended that
the Companys stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at
the Companys stockholders meeting.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Companys stockholders meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Companys
stockholders meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
business at such meeting; _provided_ that no adjournment may be to a date on
or after three Business Days prior to the date set forth in _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_.  The Company shall submit the Agreement to the stockholders of
the Company for the purpose of adopting the Agreement, whether or not (i) the
Board of Directors of the Company at any time subsequent to the date of
this Agreement shall effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, or (ii) any
actual, potential or purported Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal has
been commenced, disclosed, announced or submitted to the Board of Directors
of the Company.

        

5.4 _HSR and Other Approvals_.

  

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to the Premerger
Notification Rules (as defined below) or other applicable Antitrust Laws (as
defined below) to which _Section 5.4(b)_ , and not this _Section 5.4(a)_ ,
shall apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the parties
shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Entities
all authorizations, consents, notifications, certifications, registrations,
declarations and filings that are necessary in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall diligently and
expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the
prosecution of, such matters.

  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 20
Business Days (assuming the parties to this Agreement have received from the
other party all the information required to make all of their premerger
notification filings), following the execution of this Agreement the parties
shall make all premerger notification filings required under the HSR Act or
identified in _Schedule 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and
_Schedule 3.2(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter pursuant to the pre-merger
notification rules identified therein (the " _Premerger Notification Rules_
"). Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate fully with each other
and shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of any filings under any Premerger Notification Rules; (ii) keep
the other party reasonably informed of any communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to any Antitrust Authority, and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding the Merger and in a manner that
protects attorney-client or attorney work product privilege; and (iii) permit
the other party to review and incorporate the other partys reasonable
comments in any communication given by it to any Antitrust Authority or in
connection with any proceeding by a private party related to Antitrust Laws
with any other Person, in each case regarding the Merger and in a manner that
protects attorney-client or attorney work product privilege.  Unless
otherwise agreed and without limiting the obligations stated in this _Section
5.4(b)_ , Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts
to ensure the prompt expiration of any applicable waiting period under any
Premerger Notification Rules or approval by the relevant Antitrust Authority.
Further, without limiting the obligations stated in this _Section 5.4(b)_ ,
Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to respond
to and comply with any request for information regarding the Merger or
filings under any Premerger Notification Rules from any Governmental Entity
charged with enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating any
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization, restraining
trade or abusing a dominant position (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_
"), including the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, any
attorney general of any state of the United States, the European Commission
or any other competition authority of any jurisdiction (" _Antitrust
Authority_ "). Parent shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or
negotiations with any Antitrust Authority or other Person relating to the
foregoing Merger or filings under any Premerger Notification Rules,
_provided_ that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to
participate therein.  Neither party shall initiate any meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Entity with respect to any filings, applications,
investigation, or other inquiry regarding the Merger or filings under any
Premerger Notification Rules without giving the other party reasonable prior
notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate
(which, at the request of either party, shall be limited to outside antitrust
counsel only); _provided_ , _ however_, that the

        

Company shall not initiate any offer to any Governmental Entity with respect
to any proposed Divestiture Action.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent shall take any and all action necessary, including but not
limited to (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and
agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or
businesses of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii)
terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any
venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual
rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to
enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any
of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company
or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets; by consenting to
such action by the Company and _provided_ that any such action may, at the
discretion of the Parent, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger)
(each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that no Governmental Entity
enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary
or permanent), or establishes any law, rule, regulation or other action
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, (" _Antitrust Prohibition_ ") or to ensure that
no Antitrust Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise
approve the consummation of the Merger, fails to do so by the Termination
Date. In the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging
the Merger as violative of any Premerger Notification Rule or other Antitrust
Law, Parent shall take all action necessary, including but not limited to any
Divestiture Action to avoid or resolve such action. In the event that any
permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall take promptly any and all steps
necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to
permit such consummation prior to the Termination Date.  The parties shall
take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege
or any other privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any
applicable privilege.

  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates shall not
take any action with the intention to, or that could reasonably be expected
to, hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any necessary approval of
any Antitrust Authority under an Premerger Notification Rule or Antitrust Law
or the expiration of the required waiting period under the Premerger
Notification Rules or any other Antitrust Laws, except as may be necessary,
in its good faith judgment, to resist or reduce the scope of a Divestiture
Action but in no event beyond the Termination Date.

  

(d) If any Divestiture Action agreed to by Parent requires action by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, the
Parent hereby agrees to consent to the taking of such action by the Company
and any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned
upon consummation of the Merger.

        

(e) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of this
_Section 5.4_ shall not be construed to require either party to undertake any
efforts, or to take or consent to any action if such efforts, action or
consent would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on
the business, operations, financial condition or results of operations of the
combined business of Parent and the Company after giving effect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

5.5 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall take such action as may be
necessary so that on and after the Effective Time, and for one year
thereafter, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries not
covered by any collective bargaining agreement or labor contract who remain
employed after the Closing by Parent, its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Parent Group_ "), are provided compensation
(including, but not limited to, base salary, base wages, annual and long-term
incentive compensation) and benefits (including, but not limited to, pension
and welfare benefits but excluding equity compensation) which are, in the
aggregate, materially no less favorable than those made available by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to its officers and employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time. To the extent not duplicative of benefits, for
purposes of eligibility to participate, calculation of benefits and
vesting in all benefits provided by the Parent Group to officers and
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, such officers and employees
will be credited with their years of benefits eligibility service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any predecessors thereof to the extent such
service with a predecessor was so recognized under analogous Employee Benefit
Plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. The
eligibility of any such officer or employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to participate in any welfare benefit plan or program of the
Parent Group shall not be subject to any exclusions for any pre-existing
conditions if such individual had met the participation requirements of
similar benefit plans and programs of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time. Amounts paid before the Effective Time by such
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any health
plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall, after the Effective Time, be
taken into account in applying deductible and out-of-pocket limits applicable
under the health plans of the Parent Group to the same extent as if such
amounts had, when paid, been paid under such health plans of the
Parent Group. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall create any
rights in any officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in respect of continued employment for any specified period of any nature or
kind whatsoever or, except as set forth in the following sentence, limit
Parents or the Surviving Corporations power to amend or terminate any
particular Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan or require (and the
Company shall take no action that would require) the Parent or Surviving
Corporation to continue any particular Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign
Benefit Plan. To the extent that an agreement with an entity listed
in Schedule 3.1(m)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter obligates the Company
to require a purchaser or merger partner to assume the terms of that
agreement, Parent agrees to recognize, and cause the Surviving Corporation to
recognize, the entity that is a party to such an agreement as the exclusive
bargaining representative of the covered employees and to adopt and cause the
Surviving Corporation to adopt, the terms of that agreement and any related
and current memorandums of agreement between the Company and such entity as
are set forth in Schedule 3.1(m)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

        

(b) Except as necessary to comply with applicable law, for a period of at
least twelve months from the Effective Time, Parent Group shall not terminate
or otherwise amend the severance plans described in _Schedule 5.5(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter in a manner adverse to any officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries covered by such plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

5.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

  

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person (as defined
below) may have pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification
agreement in effect on the date hereof, from and after the Effective Time
through the six year anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless) each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Employee
Benefit Plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in their capacity as
such and not as stockholder or optionholder of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys and other
professionals fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that
are paid in settlement (with the approval of the indemnifying party), of or
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation to which such Indemnified Person is a party
based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the
fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Employee Benefit Plan of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise or by reason
of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, pertaining
to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to, the Effective Time
and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time ("
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including all Indemnified Liabilities based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law (and the Surviving Corporation shall
pay reasonable expenses incurred in defense of any claim in connection
therewith in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Person to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law); _provided_ that any person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified Persons
(whether asserted before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified
Persons may retain the Companys regularly engaged legal counsel or other
counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
_provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
for any settlement effected without its prior written consent. Any Indemnified
Person wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 5.6_ , upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall
notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to

        

notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it may have under
this _Section 5.6_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
such partys position with respect to such claims) and, if required by law,
shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation an undertaking to repay any
amounts advanced to it if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, but without any
requirement for the posting of a bond or any other terms or conditions other
than those expressly set forth herein; _provided_   _further_ , that Parent
shall not be obligated pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_ to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any
single action, unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified
Persons, there is or may be a conflict of interests between two or more of
such Indemnified Persons, in which case there may be separate counsel for
each similarly situated group.

  

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 1.4_ , Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation in any manner that would
affect (or manage the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the
intent to) adversely the rights thereunder or under the Company Certificate
of Incorporation or Company Bylaws of any Indemnified Person to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by
law.  Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill
and honor any indemnification or exculpation agreements between the Company
and any of its directors, officers or employees existing immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

  

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified
Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), relating to the enforcement of such
Indemnified Persons rights under this _Section 5.6_  or under any charter,
bylaw or contract.

  

(d) Parent agrees that immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will cause to be put in place, and Parent shall fully prepay immediately
prior to the Effective Time, "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of at least six years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and
scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect
to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to
spend more than 200% (the " _Cap Amount_ ") of the last annual premium paid
by the Company prior to the date hereof (the amount of such premium being set
forth in  _Schedule 3.1(q)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) per policy year
of coverage under such tail policy; _provided_ , _further_ that if the cost
per policy year of such insurance exceeds the Cap Amount, Parent
shall purchase as much coverage per policy year as reasonably obtainable for
the Cap Amount.

  

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.6(a)_. The provisions of
this _Section 5.6(a)_ are

        

intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or
expense advancement pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_ , and his heirs
and representatives. The Surviving Corporation shall not sell, transfer,
distribute or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy
its obligations under this _Section 5.6(a)_.

  

(f) Parent will ensure (including providing funding, if necessary) that the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation in this _Section 5.6_ are fulfilled.

investigation or other legal or administrative proceeding by any Governmental
Entity or other Person is commenced that questions the validity or legality
of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith, the parties
hereto agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend
against and respond thereto. The Company shall give Parent reasonable
 opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder

written public statement prior to such consultation, except as Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company may be required by applicable law, court order or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange (in which case such party will, to the extent practicable, promptly
inform the other parties hereto in writing in advance of such compelled
disclosure).

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be. The Company and Parent shall promptly provide

5.11 _Investigation by Parent and Merger Sub; No Other Representations or
Warranties_.

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has made
its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based on the information
provided by the Company, has formed an independent judgment concerning, the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, and Parent
and Merger Sub have requested such documents and information from the Company
as each such party considers material in determining whether to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has
had an opportunity to ask all questions of and receive answers from the
Company with respect to any matter such party considers material in
determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties made by the Company that are expressly set forth in _Section
3.1_ of this Agreement (as modified by the Company Disclosure Letter or as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents) and in any certificate provided
pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_ , neither the Company nor any other Person has
made and shall not be deemed to have made any representation or warranty of
any kind.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent
and Merger Sub agrees that neither the Company, any holder of the
Companys securities nor any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, makes or has made any representation or warranty to Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their representatives or Affiliates with respect to:

  

(i) any projections, forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or
made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective representatives
or Affiliates; or

  

(ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
representatives or Affiliates, except to the extent and as expressly covered
by a representation and warranty made by the Company and contained in
_Section 3.1_ of this Agreement.

  

5.12 _Financing_.

  

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the financing necessary to
consummate the Transactions (the " _Debt Financing_ ") on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including

        

using reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all
terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter; (ii)
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; (iii) enforce its
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter; and (iv) consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent will furnish correct and
complete copies of all such definitive agreements to the Company promptly
upon their execution.

  

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed with respect to all material
activity concerning the status of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and shall give the Company prompt notice of any material
adverse change with respect to such Debt Financing. Without limiting
the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any
event within two Business Days, if at any time (i) any Debt Commitment
Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing
source that is a party to any Debt Commitment Letter notifies Parent that
such source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent on the terms set
forth therein, or (iii) for any reason Parent no longer believes in good
faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms described therein.
Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the
prior written consent of the Company, take or fail to take any action or
enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint venture,
disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that could
reasonably be expected to breach or make untrue any representation or
warranty contained in the Commitment Letters or otherwise impair, delay or
prevent consummation of the Financing contemplated by any of the Debt
Commitment Letter. Parent shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or
alter, any Debt Commitment Letter in any manner that would prevent or
materially impair or delay the consummation of Transactions without the prior
written consent of the Company.

  

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Commitment
Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to
Parent for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions (" _Alternate Financing_ ") and to
obtain, and, if obtained, will provide the Company with a copy of, a new
financing commitment that provides for at least the same amount of financing
as such Debt Commitment Letter as originally issued and on terms and
conditions (including termination rights and funding conditions) no less
favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than those included in such Debt Commitment
Letter (the " _New Commitment Letter_ "). To the extent applicable, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the
Alternate Financing on the terms and conditions described in any New
Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on
a timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the New
Commitment Letter; (ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto
on the terms and conditions contemplated by the New Commitment Letter; (iii)
enforce its rights under the New Commitment Letter; and (iv) consummate the
Alternate Financing at or prior to the Closing.

and its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives in connection with
the cooperation set forth in this  _Section 5.13_ ; provided, nothing
contained in _Section 5.13(b)_  shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time.
 Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective officers, directors and other representatives for and
against any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by them
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith except with respect to information supplied
by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein.

shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon becoming aware (i) that any
representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect (ii) of any condition, event or
circumstance that will result in any of the conditions in _Section 6.2(a)_ or

conversion (the " _Preferred Stock Conversion_ ") of the 5% Preferred Stock
in accordance with _Section 9(a)(ii)_  and the other applicable provisions of
the Certificate of Designations and applicable law. The Preferred
Stock Conversion shall be conducted such that, subject to, and effective
immediately prior to, the Effective Time, all shares of 5% Preferred Stock
shall have been converted pursuant to their terms into that number of shares
of Company Common Stock specified in the Certificate of Designations.

  

5.15 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take such
actions as may be necessary to cause dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including

        

derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this

the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
that such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure
Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, or that such items are
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, Parent
or Merger Sub, as the case may be. The headings, if any, of the individual
sections of each of the Parent Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure
Letter are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to
constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure
Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are arranged in sections corresponding to
those contained in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_ merely for
convenience, and the disclosure of (i) an item in one section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
particular representation or warranty and (ii) disclosures made in the
Company SEC Documents shall in each case be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties
is readily apparent on its face from such item, notwithstanding the presence
or absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to such other representations or
warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto.

  

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to
determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement.

        

(d) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles,
Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding
Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions
of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise.  Titles appearing at
the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of
this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of such
Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be
disregarded in construing the language contained therein. The words "this
Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof" and words of similar
import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this Section,"
"this subsection" and words of similar import, refer only to the Sections
or subsections hereof in which such words occur.  The word "including" (in
its various forms) means "including, without limitation." Pronouns in
masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include
any other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein)
in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa,
unless the context otherwise expressly requires.  Unless the context
otherwise requires, all defined terms contained herein shall include the
singular and plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such defined
terms.  Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to a specific
time shall refer to Houston, Texas time.

  

8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, including via facsimile transmission, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when two
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the
same counterpart.

  

8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.  This Agreement
(together with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other documents and
instruments executed pursuant hereto) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,

(i) right of holders of Company Common Stock to enforce their rights to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _ARTICLE II_ upon
consummation of the Merger in the event that the Merger is consummated, and
(ii) the Indemnified Persons intended to be third party beneficiaries of
_Section 5.6,_ who shall have the right to enforce such provisions directly,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any right, benefit or remedy of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith
or required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent
action or the failure to take an

Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this Agreement shall
terminate.

  

8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the

_6.3_. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. Any purported assignment
