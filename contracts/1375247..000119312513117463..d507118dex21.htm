Inc., a Canadian corporation (" _Guarantor_ "). Certain terms used in this
Agreement are used as defined in  _Section 9.12_.

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the Company and Merger
Sub have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, it is proposed that pursuant to this Agreement, and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, Parent will cause Merger Sub to make a
tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this
Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") at a price per share of $19.75, net to the seller in cash,
without interest (such amount, or any other amount per share of Company
Common Stock paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the
" _Offer Price_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement; 

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge (the "
_Merger_ ") with and into the Company in accordance with the General

contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, fair
to and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved
this Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with the requirements of
the DGCL and (iii) subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub approved
and declared advisable this Agreement providing for the Offer and the Merger
in accordance with the DGCL, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_The Offer_

 

SECTION 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event no later than ten
(10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) an offer to
purchase all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the Offer Price.
The obligations of Merger Sub, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub, to accept
for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant
to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger
Sub of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto (the " _Offer Conditions_
"). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive
any Offer Condition in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, or
to modify the terms or conditions of the Offer, except that, without the
written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not
permit Merger Sub to, (i) reduce the Offer Price, (ii) change the form
of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (iv) waive or change the Minimum
Condition or the Termination Condition (each as defined in _Annex A_ ), (v)
add to the Offer Conditions, (vi) terminate, or extend or otherwise amend or
modify the expiration date of the Offer except as required or permitted by
_Section 1.1(b)_ or (vii) amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition or
any term of the Offer set forth in this Agreement in a manner (other than in
an immaterial manner) adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock. The
Company agrees that no Company Common Stock held by the Company, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer;
_provided_ , that the Company shall be permitted to tender Company Common
Stock held or beneficially owned by the Company pursuant to or in respect of a
Company Plan or a trust that relates to obligations pursuant to a Company
Plan.

(b) The Offer shall expire on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days
after the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the
Exchange Act); _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the provisions of
Article VIII, (i) if at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, if any
Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law), Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion,
without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer for one or more
consecutive increments of not more than five (5) Business Days each (the
length of such period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub), until the
earlier of (A) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
and (B) the date six (6) months from the date hereof (the " _Walk-Away Date_
") and (ii) if at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, if any Offer
Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted
under applicable Law), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause merger Sub
to), extend the Offer at the request of the Company for one or more
consecutive increments of not more than five (5) Business Days each (the
length of such period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub), until the
earlier of (A) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
and (B) the Walk-Away Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer (x) beyond the Walk-Away Date or
(y) at any time that Parent or Merger Sub is permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII.

 



2  In addition, Merger Sub may (and shall where fewer than 90% of the total
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding have been accepted for payment
in the Offer or are to be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option immediately following the Acceptance Time) provide a subsequent
offering period (a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") after the expiration of
the Offer, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall Merger Sub be required to provide a
Subsequent Offering Period (x) beyond the Walk-Away Date or (y) at any time
that Parent or Merger Sub is permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Article VIII. Without the consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall have the
right to extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff applicable to the Offer.

(c) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the
satisfaction, or waiver by Merger Sub, of all of the Offer Conditions, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i) accept for payment all
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer promptly after the expiration date thereof (as the same
may be extended or required to be extended, the " _Expiration Date_ ") and pay
for (subject to any applicable Tax withholding pursuant to  _Section
3.2(b)(iii)_) such shares as soon as practicable (and, in any event, no more
than two (2) Business Days ) after the Expiration Date or (ii) in the case of
any shares of Company Common Stock tendered during any Subsequent Offering
Period, accept for payment and pay for all such shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as soon as practicable (and, in any
event, no more than two (2) Business Days following the valid tender of
such Shares). The Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration date
(as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with
_Section 1.1(b)_), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with  _Section 8.1_. Nothing contained in this _Section 1.1(c)_ shall
affect any termination rights set forth in _Section 8.1_.

SECTION 1.2 _Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall (a) file a Schedule TO (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to
the Offer, which shall contain or shall incorporate by reference an offer to
purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and forms of the related letter of
transmittal and form of summary advertisement (the Schedule TO, the Offer to
Purchase and such other documents, together with all amendments, supplements
and exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (b) cause the Offer

material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents and any amendments thereto (including the proposed final version
thereof) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give

 



3  due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and
Merger Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel any comments, whether
written or oral, that Parent or Merger Sub may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
such responses (including the proposed final version thereof) and Parent shall

suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Each of Parent and Merger

provisions of applicable Law.

the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the recommendation

Company Board described in _Section 4.3(b)_, and shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders (concurrently with and
in the same mailing envelope as the Offer Documents) as required by Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply
in all material respects with the provisions of applicable Law. Parent and
Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent
required by applicable Law. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
and any amendments thereto (including the proposed final version thereof)
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. In addition, the Company
agrees to provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel any comments, whether

of any oral comments or other communications. Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any
written responses (including the proposed final version thereof) and to

4  and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,

counsel. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents

date and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such additional available
information (including periodic updates of such information) and such other

employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, under which
any such Person could become entitled to (i) any additional compensation,
enhanced severance or other benefits or any acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any compensation, severance or other benefits or any

Subsidiaries, in each case as a result of the Transactions (alone or
in combination with any other event), or (ii) any other compensation or
benefits from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries related to or contingent
upon or the value of which would be calculated on the basis of the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions (alone or in combination with any
other event) and shall take all other actions required to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under

Company Common Stock at such time represented by the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries at such time (including shares of Company Common
Stock so accepted for payment); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be
entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors on the Company
Board as long as Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the
shares of Company Common Stock. In furtherance thereof and subject to
applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable prior to the Effective
Time, the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market), the
Company shall, upon request of Parent, promptly take all actions necessary to
cause Parents designees to be so elected or appointed, including increasing
the size of its Board of Directors (subject to compliance with the terms the

resignation). At such time and subject to applicable Law (including, to the
extent applicable prior to the Effective Time, the continued listing
requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market), the Company shall, upon request of
Parent, also promptly take all actions necessary to cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up
to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of

Board necessary to allow the Company to comply with this _Section 1.5_ , which
resignation letters (x) shall be conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Acceptance Time, (y) shall have been accepted by the Company Board and (z)
shall remain in full force and effect at all times prior to the Effective
Time.

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1

together with the Schedule 14D-9 the information required under Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be elected or
appointed to the Company Board ( _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall
have provided to the Company on a timely basis any information with respect to
itself and its officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1).

(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to this _Section 1.5_, then, until the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least two directors
who are members of the Company Board on the date of this Agreement and who
are independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under

 



6  the Exchange Act (the " _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the number of Independent Directors is reduced below two for any
reason, the remaining Independent Director shall be entitled to nominate an
individual who qualifies as an independent director for purposes of Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be an
Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent
Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate two individuals to
fill such vacancies who are independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the
Exchange Act, and such individuals shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement. The Company shall promptly take all
action as may be necessary to comply with its obligations under this _Section
1.5(c)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and
after the time, if any, that Parents designees pursuant to this _Section
1.5_ constitute a majority of the Company Board and prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the terms hereof, (1) any amendment or termination of
this Agreement by the Company, (2) any extension by the Company of the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Merger Sub hereunder, (3) any exercise or waiver of any of the Companys
rights or remedies hereunder, (4) any amendment to the Company Charter
Documents or (5) except for the Transactions in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, any transaction between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other, will require the
concurrence of each of the Independent Directors (the " _Independent Director
Approval_ "). It is understood that the Independent Directors will be
entitled to retain their own separate counsel.

SECTION 1.6 _The Top-Up Option_. 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company that number of shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of
Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock held by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of such exercise,
shall constitute one share more than 90% of the total shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis and assuming the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares), at a price per share equal to the Offer
Price.

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once in whole and not in part, (x)
following the expiration of the Offer or any Subsequent Offering Period and
(y) prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day after the applicable expiration date
of the Offer or any Subsequent Offering Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the obligation of the Company to deliver the Top-Up Shares is subject to the
conditions that (i) no Restraint that has the effect of prohibiting the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or preventing the issuance and delivery of the
Top-Up Shares shall be in effect; (ii) the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock that are not
otherwise subscribed for or committed to be issued; and (iii) Merger Sub has
accepted for payment and paid for all shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered in the Offer and any Subsequent Offering Period and not withdrawn;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the
earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms. The parties shall cooperate to ensure
that the issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished consistent with
applicable Law, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Shares

 



7  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "). Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub may acquire
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities
Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from
registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby
represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub will be, upon the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-
Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

(c) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger
Sub shall notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be owned by Parent
and Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares and
(ii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares
(the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, as soon as practicable
following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and the number
of Top-Up Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares and the Company
shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up
Shares, which certificate may include any legends required by applicable
securities Laws. The aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares
or any portion thereof may be paid by Merger Sub either in cash or by
executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note (the " _Promissory
Note_ ") having a principal amount equal to the aggregate cash purchase price
for the Top-Up Shares. Any such promissory note (v) shall be full recourse
against Parent and Merger Sub, (w) shall bear interest at the rate of interest
per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing from time to time during
such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , (x) shall mature on
the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory
note, (y) may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty and
(z) shall have no other material terms.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and agrees that, in any appraisal
proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares,
the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Shares or any cash or Promissory Note delivered
by Merger Sub to the Company in payment for such Top-Up Shares shall not be
taken into account in connection with the determination of the fair value of
the Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

9 ARTICLE III

_Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;
Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_

 

SECTION 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any shares of Company Common Stock held by a Company
Plan or a trust that relates to obligations pursuant to a Company Plan),
other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ and (ii) Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount of cash
equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
All shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this  _Section 3.1_ shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated shares of Company
Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

(b) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (in each case, other than any such shares of Company Common
Stock held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

(d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and that
are held by holders of such

 



10  shares of Company Common Stock who have not voted in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly
exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who
have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for,
at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for
payment of the Merger Consideration for such shares of Company Common Stock.
At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such notices and demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle any such demands.

 

(e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution is declared with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

SECTION 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall
be appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved in advance by the
Company in writing (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in
trust for the benefit of holders of the shares of Company Common Stock, the
Company Stock Options and the Company Stock-Based Awards, cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange
for all of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares), payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article III
and (ii) the Option and Stock-Based Consideration payable pursuant to 
_Section 3.3_ (such cash referred to in subsections (a)(i) and (a)(ii) being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail (x) to each holder of record of shares of
Company Common 

 



11  Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_, (A) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may mutually agree) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and (y) to each
holder of a Company Stock Option or Company Stock-Based Award, a check in an
amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ or
_Section 3.3(b)_ hereof in respect of such Company Stock Option or Company
Stock-Based Award.

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the
Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee
if the Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock
is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(iii) The Paying Agent, Parent and the Company shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Company
Stock-Based Awards, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of
U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Authority, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Company Stock-
Based Awards, in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for
transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check in the proper
amount pursuant to this Article III.

 



12 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock for one
(1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common
Stock who have not surrendered their shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.2_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their shares of Company Common
Stock.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to  _Section 3.2(d)_.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

SECTION 3.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Options, Company Stock-Based Awards
and Restricted Shares_.

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the Company Stock
Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and
be converted into the right to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash
in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (y) the excess,
if any, of the amount of the Offer Price over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, with the aggregate
amount of such payment rounded to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount of
such cash hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ ") less
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such
payment. Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans shall be
cancelled and of no further force or effect.

 



13 (b) _Other Stock-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any
kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or
benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of
Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans or Company Plans
(including restricted stock units, phantom units, deferred stock units and
dividend equivalents), other than Restricted Shares and Company Stock Options
(each, other than Restricted Shares and Company Stock Options, a " _Company
Stock-Based Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or
award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, shall become fully
vested and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, at the Effective Time
an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each share
of Company Common Stock underlying a particular Company Stock-Based Award (the
aggregate amount of such cash, together with the Option
Consideration, hereinafter referred to as the " _Option and Stock-Based
Consideration_ ") less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to
the making of such payment.

(c) _Restricted Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award
of restricted Company Common Stock (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall vest
in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 3.1(a)_, less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local
Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment.

(d) _Company Actions_. The Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall
make such adjustments or determinations with respect to the Company Stock
Options, the Company Stock-Based Awards and Restricted Shares that, in each
case, the Company determines to be necessary to implement the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 3.3_.

(e) _Rights of Holders_. The holders of Company Stock Options, Company Stock-
Based Awards and Restricted Shares shall have the right to enforce, and shall
be beneficiaries with respect to, the provisions of this _Section 3.3_.

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

Except as disclosed in (a) the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (with specific reference to the particular Section or
subsection of this Agreement to which the information set forth in such
Company Disclosure Letter relates; _provided_ , that any information set forth
in one section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to
each other Section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is readily
apparent on the face of such disclosure contained in the Company Disclosure
Letter), or (b) disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and each Current Report on Form 8-K filed
subsequent to such Form 10-K but prior to the date of this Agreement, but
excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section
or in any other section to the extent they are forward-looking statements or
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature; _provided_ , that the
exception provided for in this clause (b) shall be applied if, 

 



14  and only if, the nature and content of the applicable disclosure in any such
Company SEC Document filed prior to the date hereof is reasonably specific as
to matters and items such that the subject matter of such disclosure is
reasonably apparent on the face of the text of such disclosure to be
applicable to the representation set forth herein, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

SECTION 4.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted, except where the failure to have such governmental
approvals, would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing, except for such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) As used in this Agreement, any reference to any facts, circumstances,
events or changes having a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means such
facts, circumstances, developments, events or changes that result in any
change or effect that is or would reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities (contingent or
otherwise), condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but shall not include (a)
facts, circumstances, events or changes resulting from (i) changes in United
States or global economic or political conditions or the securities, credit
or financial markets in general, (ii) general changes or developments in the
industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, including
general changes in Law or regulation (except for changes in Law or regulation
that relate to Hydroquinone or sales of the Company Products over the
Internet), (iii) the announcement of this Agreement or the pendency or
consummation of the Merger, (iv) the identity of Parent or any of its
Affiliates as the acquiror of the Company, (v) compliance with the terms of,
or the taking of any action specifically required by, this Agreement or
consented to in writing by Parent, (vi) any acts of terrorism or war (other
than any of the foregoing that causes any damage or destruction to or renders
unusable any material facility or material property of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) or (vii) changes in generally accepted accounting principles
or the interpretation thereof; except, in the case of the foregoing clauses
(i), (ii) and (vii), to the extent such changes or developments referred to
therein have a materially disproportionate impact on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other companies in the
industries and in the geographic markets in which the Company conducts its
businesses after taking into account the size of the Company relative to such
other companies or (b) any decline in the stock price of the Company Common
Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market or any other market on which such
securities are listed for purchase or sale or any failure to meet internal or
published projections, forecasts or revenue or earning predictions for any
period ( _provided_ , that the underlying causes of such decline or failure
may, to the extent applicable, be considered in determining whether there is a
Company Material Adverse Effect).

 



15 (c) The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement a true and complete copy of the Company Charter Documents, each as
amended through the date hereof, and the equivalent organizational documents
(including all partnership, limited liability company or similar agreements)
of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as amended through the date of
this Agreement. The Company Charter Documents and the equivalent
organizational documents (including all partnership, limited liability company
or similar agreements) of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and
have not been amended or otherwise modified. The Company is not in violation
of any provision of the Company Charter Documents. No Subsidiary of the
Company is in violation of any provision of its certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or equivalent organizational documents (including all partnership,
limited liability company or similar agreements), except where such violations
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to such Subsidiary. The Company has made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of the minutes (or, in the case of minutes that
have not yet been finalized, complete and correct drafts thereof) of (i) all
meetings of the stockholders or other equity-holders of the Company and, to
the extent available, each of the Companys Subsidiaries, (ii) the boards of
directors (or equivalent governing body) of the Company and, to the extent
available, each of the Companys Subsidiaries and (iii) the committees of
each such board of directors (or comparable governing body), in each case held
since January 1, 2010 and prior to the date hereof.

SECTION 4.2 _Capitalization._

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par

obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any
consent, approval, order, authorization or permit of, or declaration,
registration, filing with, or notification to, any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period or (2) significantly increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting or impeding the
consummation of the Transactions or (B) otherwise would reasonably be
expected to materially delay or impair the consummation of the Transactions;
or

(xxi) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, agree, in
writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, at Companys expense, effect
the necessary corrective change of ownership and recordals with all patent,
trademark, and copyright offices and domain name registrars and other similar
authorities where Company Registered Intellectual Property is recorded in the
name of one or more legal predecessors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Person other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 6.3 _No Solicitation by the Company; Etc._

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Companys and
its Subsidiaries respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the return from all such Persons or cause the destruction
of all copies of confidential information previously provided within the last
one (1) year to such parties by the Company, its Subsidiaries or
Representatives in connection with exploring a sale of the Company. The
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing or providing access to non-public
information), or take any other action which would reasonably be expected to
facilitate, any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or which would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding any Takeover
Proposal, (iii) approve any transaction under, or any Person (other than
Parent or Merger Sub) becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203
of the DGCL (except in connection with the Transactions

 



46  provided for in this Agreement) or (iv) enter into any merger or other
agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar instrument constituting or
related to any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if after the
date hereof but prior to the Acceptance Time the Company Board receives an
unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof
but prior to the Acceptance Time and the Company Board determines in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes, or would reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, if a
majority of the Company Board determines (after consultation with outside
counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
and subject to compliance with this _Section 6.3(a)_ and _Section 6.3(b)_, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time (but in no event after the Acceptance
Time) and after providing Parent not less than forty eight (48) hours prior
written notice of such determination by the Company Board (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a
customary confidentiality agreement with terms substantially similar to, and
with a standstill not less restrictive, and other provisions not less
restrictive (other than in an immaterial respect) than, those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (including the "standstill" covenant);
_provided_ , that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include any
provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and
(2) the Company provides Parent, in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, any non-public information with respect to the
Company furnished to such other Person which was not previously furnished to
Parent prior to the time it is provided to such other Person, which
information shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) participate in discussions and negotiations
with such Person regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by the Companys Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be a
material breach of this _Section 6.3_ by the Company. 

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 6.3_, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in
writing (and in any case within twenty four (24) hours of knowledge of
receipt) of the receipt by the Company of any Takeover Proposal, or any
inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal,
and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person
making such Takeover Proposal and the terms and conditions of such Takeover
Proposal (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such Takeover
Proposal), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of
all material developments affecting the status and terms of any such Takeover
Proposal (and the Company shall provide Parent promptly after receipt or
delivery thereof with copies of any additional written materials received that
relate to such Takeover Proposal) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. In addition, during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, the Company shall enforce, and not terminate,
amend, modify or waive (except for a waiver of any standstill provisions to
allow such counterparty to make a proposal to the Company Board)
any provision of any confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party.

 



47 (c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.3(c)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the recommendation by the Company Board that stockholders of the
Company accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock to
Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ ") or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Takeover
Proposal or take any action or make any public statement inconsistent with the
Company Board Recommendation (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or
authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger,
acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement
constituting or related to, or that is intended to or reasonably expected to
lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
in accordance with _Section 6.3(a))_ (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Company Board may
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, or recommend a
Takeover Proposal, if the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after consulting with outside counsel, that the failure to make such
withdrawal, modification or recommendation would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under the
DGCL, and (y) if the Company Board receives after the date hereof but before
the Acceptance Time an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal that
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, in response to such
Superior Proposal and after the expiration of the five (5) Business Day
period described below (but in no event later than the Acceptance Time), enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if
the Company shall have concurrently with entering into such
Company Acquisition Agreement terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and paid the Termination Fee required pursuant to _Section 8.3_,
but only after the fifth (5th) Business Day following Parents receipt
of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board is
prepared to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms of the
applicable Takeover Proposal, identify the Person making such Superior
Proposal, and include copies of any written materials relating to such
Takeover Proposal (the " _Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ "), and
terminate this Agreement, and only if, during such five (5) Business Day
period, the Company and its Representatives shall have, if requested by
Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent and Parents Representatives to
make such adjustments in the terms of this Agreement as would enable Parent
to proceed with the Transactions on such adjusted terms and, at the end of
such five (5) Business Day period, after taking into account any such adjusted
terms as may have been proposed by Parent since its receipt of such written
notice, the Company Board has again in good faith made the determination
referred to above in this clause (y). To the extent any five (5) Business Day
period described in the preceding sentence would expire after the Acceptance
Time, the Acceptance Time shall be automatically extended such that it will
occur on the first (1st) Business Day after the expiration of such five (5)
Business Day period. In the event of any material change to the terms of a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, make the determination
referred to above in clause (y), including the delivery of a new Company
Notice of Adverse Recommendation and the commencement of a new five (5)
Business Day period.

 



48 (d) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer (whether in
writing or otherwise) from any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any
(A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including securities of Subsidiaries) equal to 15% or more of the Companys
consolidated assets or to which 15% or more of the Companys revenues or
earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions or by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (C)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially
owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or of any resulting parent company of the Company, other than
the Transactions.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written offer, that did not arise
from a breach of this _Section 6.3_, obtained after the date hereof but prior
to the Acceptance Time, to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration
consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the equity securities of the
Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a third party, with no financing
contingency, which the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of national
reputation) to be (a) more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a
financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger, taking into account
all relevant factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal
and the Offer and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of the
Offer and this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or
otherwise)) and (b) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account
all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects and terms of such proposal
and the third party.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its stockholders required
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC if the Company Board
determines, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties or applicable Law; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_  that in no
event shall the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof take, or
agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by _Section 6.3_.

(f) For purposes of this _Section 6.3_, the term "Representatives" shall mean
directors, officers, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and
authorized agents.

 



49 SECTION 6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents required under
applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, (iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and (iv) subject to _Section 6.3_, make solicitations and
recommendations to the holders of Company Common Stock for purposes of causing
the Minimum Condition to be satisfied. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_
" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR
Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, all applicable Non-U.S.
Antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental
Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the
Company each shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other and as
promptly as practicable and without undue delay: (i) no later than five (5)
Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to
the Transactions and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section 6.4_ necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable; (ii) file all appropriate filings
required under any Non-U.S. Antitrust Law; and (iii) file all other
appropriate filings required by any other Governmental Authority. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable
to any of the Transactions and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar
Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary
to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect
of such Law on the Transactions.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested by any Governmental Authority, and each of the parties hereto shall,
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any
applicable Antitrust Law that may be asserted or required by any foreign or
U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Authority, in each case with
competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to close the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the Walk-
Away Date. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.4_ to the contrary,
(A) neither Parent, Merger Sub, their Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be required to take any action (including, without
limitation, divesting or licensing or otherwise restricting use

 



50  or operation of assets, properties or businesses of either the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries) that would materially impair
the overall benefits expected to be realized from the consummation of the
Transactions and (B) neither the Company nor any Company subsidiary or
affiliate shall agree to take any action that would materially impair the
overall benefits expected to be realized from the consummation of
the Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent.

(d) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall (i) furnish to the other party such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other party may request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR
Act, any Non-U.S. Antitrust Law or otherwise required by a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions, (ii) give the other party
reasonable prior notice of any such filings or submissions and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, of any communication with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC, the United States
Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") and any other Governmental Authority
regarding the Transactions, and permit the other party to review and discuss
in advance, and consider in good faith the views of, and secure the
participation of, the other party in connection with, any such filings,
submissions, communications, inquiries or requests, (iii) unless
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority, and
to the extent reasonably practicable, (A) not participate in or attend any
meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental
Authority in respect of the Transactions without the other party, (B) give
the other party reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation,
(C) in the event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Authority from participating in or attending any such
meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep such party apprised with
respect thereto, (D) cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda,
white papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications
explaining or defending this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests
or objections made by any Governmental Authority and (E) furnish the other
party with copies of all filings, submissions, correspondence and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and its affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and
any U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority or members of any Governmental
Authoritys staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions and (iv) comply with any inquiry or information or document
request from the FTC, the DOJ or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental
Authority as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of Parent and the
Company may designate any non-public, competitively-sensitive information
provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to "Outside
Antitrust Counsel Only" and any such information shall not be shared with
employees, officers or directors or their equivalents of the other party
without approval of the party providing the non-public information.

 

SECTION 6.5 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the Transactions, each of the Company and Parent and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the Transactions.

 



51 SECTION 6.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press releases issued by
Parent and the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except
(a) as may be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with a
national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not
issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other party) or (b) to bring
or defend a claim in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding
this Agreement or the Transactions.

SECTION 6.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The Company shall afford to Parent and to its officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors, agents and other
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access during
normal business hours, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the Termination Date, to its and its Subsidiaries
properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and any report, schedule
or other document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of
applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation
of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
would reasonably be likely to result in a loss of privilege to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law.

(b) No review pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty contained herein, the covenants or
agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereto under this Agreement. All information provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.7_ shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, (iii) the
discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause
an Offer Condition not to be satisfied, and (iv) any material failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall not (x) cure any breach of,
or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit
the remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

 



52 SECTION 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of
the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be,
of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate
of incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents or in any agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any of its
Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organization
documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the
Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim
made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or
resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume, be jointly and severally liable with the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain such policies
in full force and effect, and continue to honor, in accordance with their
respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.9_
without limit as to time.

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each thereof) each current and former director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served
as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Action,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission
occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as
an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at
the request or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of any such
Action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action. 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the Companys current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to
pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages required to be
obtained pursuant 

 



53  hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase
prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and
conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and
its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective
Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. If
such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by Company prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further
obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.

 

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.9_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.9_. 

SECTION 6.10 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 8.3_, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated. Other than any Taxes imposed
upon a holder of shares of the Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or
Company Stock-Based Awards, the Company shall pay all Taxes incident to
preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions (including (i) transfer, stamp
and documentary Taxes or fees and (ii) sales, use, gains, real property
transfer and other similar Taxes or fees).

SECTION 6.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be required by applicable Law to cause dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
Merger by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject
to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated
January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

 



54 SECTION 6.12 _Further Assurances_. In case at any time after the Acceptance
Date (including after the Effective Time) any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Parent.

 

SECTION 6.13 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. If, after the
consummation of the Offer and any exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number
of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries collectively represent at least 90% of the then
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
and the Company shall execute and deliver such documents and instruments and
take such other actions as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request in
order to, cause the Merger to be completed as promptly as reasonably
practicable in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL, without a Company
Stockholders Meeting or Company Stockholder Approval, and otherwise as
provided in this Agreement.

SECTION 6.14 _Employee Matters_.

(a) During the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on the
first anniversary of the Acceptance Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Parent shall provide or cause the Company and the Surviving Corporation to
provide to each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ "), compensation and employee benefits that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits, other
than severance and termination benefits, provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent, pursuant to compensation and benefit plans sponsored by
Parent or its Affiliates.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.14(a)_, for the period
ending on the earlier of the Continuation Period or the term of such
employment agreement, Parent shall cause or shall cause the Company and the
Surviving Corporation to maintain and honor the employment agreements set
forth on Section 6.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(c) With respect to all employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Affiliates, each Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company
or such Subsidiaries, to the extent service with the predecessor employer
is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiaries) shall be treated for all
purposes as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any

similar Company Plan as of the Acceptance Time, (y) waive any and all
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements with
respect to such Continuing Employees to the extent that any applicable

the Acceptance Time and (z) credit each Continuing Employee with all
deductible payments, co-payments, and other out-of-pocket payments paid by
such employee under a Company Plan prior to the Acceptance Time during the
year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to
which any such employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or
she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under the health benefit plan of
the Surviving Corporation for such year.

(e) Nothing in this  _Section 6.14_ shall (i) confer any rights or remedies
of any kind or description upon any Continuing Employee or any other Person
other than the Company and Parent and their respective successors and assigns,
(ii) except as may otherwise be required to comply with Section 6.14, be
construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of or limitation on the ability

any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee at any time.

stockholder Action.

 

SECTION 6.17 _Guarantee of Guarantor_.

(a) Guarantor is executing this Agreement to guarantee the performance by each
of Parent and Merger Sub of its payment and performance obligations under this
Agreement. Guarantor hereby guarantees unconditionally Parent and Merger
Subs payment obligations in and performance under this Agreement. This

waives all need for notice of the same.

(b) Guarantor is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good

deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Guarantor and the performance of Guarantor of its obligations hereunder have

(i) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ _,_
_however_ _,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a party if such Restraint was primarily

(ii) if the Offer shall have expired pursuant to its terms (taking into
account all extensions made in accordance with  _Section 1.1_ hereof)
without any shares of Company Common Stock being purchased therein, _provided_
_,_ _however_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform any

to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer;

 

(iii) if no shares of Company Common Stock shall have been purchased pursuant
to the Offer on or before the Walk-Away Date; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ shall
not be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement resulted in the failure of the Offer to be so
consummated by the Walk-Away Date; or

(c) by the Company:

 

(i) if Merger Sub shall have failed to commence the Offer on or prior to the
date provided therefor in  _Section 1.1_ and such breach is not cured within
ten (10) Business Days following receipt of written notice of such breach from
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ if the Company is in material

Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.3_;
_provided_ , that (x) prior to or simultaneously therewith the Company shall
have paid or caused to be paid the Termination Fee to Parent in accordance
with _Section 8.3_ (and such termination of this Agreement by the Company
shall not take effect unless and until the Termination Fee has been paid to
Parent) and (y) the Company shall also have complied with all the other
requirements of _Section 6.3_;

 



58 (iii) if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform any of
its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, or
any such representation or warranty shall have become untrue or incorrect on
any date subsequent to the date hereof, in any such case, which breach or
failure to perform (A) has had and would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (B) is
not curable or has not been cured before the earlier of the Walk-Away Date or
twenty (20) calendar days following receipt of written notice of such breach
or failure to perform; or

(d) by Parent:

 

(i) if (A) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or (B)
following the public announcement of a Takeover Proposal or the commencement
of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Company Shares, the Company Board
shall have failed to publicly confirm the Company Board Recommendation (and,
in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer, failed to publicly recommend
that the holders of Company Shares reject such tender offer or exchange offer)
upon Parents written request within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of
any such request (or, in the case of a tender or exchange offer, such
commencement) (or, if the Walk-Away Date is fewer than ten (10) Business Days
after the Companys receipt of such request from Parent or, in the case of a
tender or exchange offer, the commencement, by the close of business on the
Business Day immediately preceding the Walk-Away Date);

(ii) if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or any such representation
or warranty or warranty shall have become untrue or incorrect on any date
subsequent to the date hereof, in any such case, which breach or failure to
perform (A) would give rise to the conditions set forth in clause (c)(ii) of
_Annex A_ and (B) is not curable or has not been cured before the earlier of
the Walk-Away Date or twenty (20) calendar days following receipt of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform;

(iii) prior to the Expiration Date, if the Company shall have materially
breached any of the provisions of _Section 6.3_; or

(iv) prior to the Expiration Date, if on any then scheduled expiration date
of the Offer, Parent is not required to extend the Offer pursuant to this
Agreement and any of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ shall not have been
satisfied.

 

SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void (other than the provisions of the second sentence of _Section
1.4(c)_, the first sentence of _Section 4.21_, _Section 5.9_, the second
sentence of _Section 6.6_, the last sentence of _Section 6.7(b)_, _Section
6.10_, this  _Section 8.2_ and _Section 8.3_, and Article IX, all of which
shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective
directors, officers 

 



59  and Affiliates, except (i) the Company may have liability as provided in
_Section 8.3_ and (ii) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for
fraud or any willful and material breach of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that:

(i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly to the Company Board
or the Companys stockholders, any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional or withdrawn) to make such a Takeover
Proposal or such a Takeover Proposal otherwise becomes publicly known, and
thereafter, (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or  _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ and (C) the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, a
transaction contemplated by any Takeover Proposal within twelve (12) months of
the date this Agreement is terminated; 

(ii) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the Company Board or the
Companys stockholders, any Person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional or withdrawn) to make such a Takeover Proposal or
such a Takeover Proposal otherwise becomes publicly known, and thereafter, (B)
this Agreement is terminated by the Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_
or _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ and (C) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, a transaction contemplated by any
Takeover Proposal within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is
terminated;

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_
; or

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ ;

then in any such event under clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this 
_Section 8.3(a)_, the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of
$16,172,214 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ").

 

For purposes of _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ and _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_, the term "
_Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of
Takeover Proposal contained in _Section 6.3(d)_ except that all references to
15% shall be deemed references to 50%.

(b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of
_Section 8.3(a)_ shall be made to Parent within five (5) Business Days
following the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect
to, or the consummation of any transaction contemplated by a Takeover
Proposal; any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (iii) of _Section
8.3(a)_ shall be made to Parent promptly following termination of this
Agreement by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ (and in any event not
later than one (1) Business Day after delivery to the Company of notice of
demand for payment following such termination); any payment required to be
made pursuant to clause (iv) of _Section 8.3(a)_ shall be made to Parent

 



60  prior to or simultaneously with (and as a condition to the effectiveness of)
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_. All such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account to be designated by Parent.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii) (and no amount is payable by Company pursuant to _Section
8.3(a))_, then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to Parents documented
out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions, by wire transfer of same-day funds three (3) Business
Days after the date of such termination of this Agreement as referred to in
this sentence; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not limit or be deemed
to limit any liability of the Company or damages or other remedy to which
Parent may be entitled as a result of any willful breach of this Agreement by
the Company. The Company will not be obligated to make a payment pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(c)_ if the Company has paid or is required to pay the
Termination Fee set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_, and any fees paid by the
Company under this _Section 8.3(c)_ will be credited against any such
Termination Fee to the extent that such fee subsequently becomes payable by
the Company.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the fee and the other provisions of this
_Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without
these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, in
the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee required
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ when due, such fee shall accrue interest for
the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a rate equal to
the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of New York
from time to time during such period, as such banks Prime Lending Rate plus
1.00%. In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay such fee when due, the
Company shall also pay to Parent all of Parents costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect
such fee.

 

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(iii), then Parent shall pay the Company a fee equal to the
Companys documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions, by wire transfer of same-day funds
three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination of this Agreement
as referred to in this sentence; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not
limit or be deemed to limit any liability of Parent or damages or other remedy
to which the Company may be entitled as a result of any willful breach of
this Agreement by Parent.

ARTICLE IX

_Miscellaneous_

SECTION 9.1 _No Survival, Etc_. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise
provided in _SECTION 8.2_ , upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_SECTION 8.1_ , as the case may be. The Confidentiality Agreement shall (i)
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii)
terminate as of the Effective Time. No information provided or made available
by the Company or its representatives to Parent or Merger Sub or
their representatives shall be deemed to be disclosed in this Agreement or in
the Company Disclosure Letter, except to the extent actually set forth herein
or therein.

 



61 SECTION 9.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after approval of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby by the stockholders of the Company, by written agreement of the parties
hereto authorized by action taken by their respective Boards of Directors
(which in the case of the Company after the Acceptance Time shall include the
Independent Director Approval contemplated by _Section 1.5_); _provided_ _,_
_however_ , that following approval of the Transactions by the stockholders
of the Company, if required, there shall be no amendment or change to the
provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without such approval.

SECTION 9.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions; _provided_ , that in the case of the Company
following the Acceptance Time, the Independent Director Approval contemplated
by _Section 1.5_ is obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party.

SECTION 9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may, prior
to the mailing of the Company Proxy Statement, if any, assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
_Section 9.4_ shall be null and void.

SECTION 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other means
of electronic transmission (such as via portable document format (.pdf)) shall
be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart.

SECTION 9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
together with _Annex A_ hereto, the Company Disclosure Letters and the
Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and (b) except for the provisions of _Section 6.9_,

 



62  are not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding clause (b) of
the immediately preceding sentence, following the Effective Time, the right
to receive payment pursuant to the Merger pursuant to Article III shall be
enforceable by holders of Certificates and holders of Book-Entry Shares and
the right to receive payment pursuant to the Merger pursuant to _Section
3.3_ shall be enforceable by holders of Company Stock Options, Company Stock-
Based Awards and Restricted Shares.

SECTION 9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding
for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with this _Section 9.7_, (b) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue
of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

 

SECTION 9.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of
them hereunder to consummate this Agreement,

 



63  and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
specified in _Section 9.7(b)_, without proof of damages or bond or other
security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an
adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and
without such right, none of the parties would have entered into this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.9 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, facsimiled (which is confirmed) or sent by overnight courier
(providing proof of delivery) to the parties at the following addresses:

hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 9.11 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive

(which means, as of any time, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding, together with all shares of Company Common Stock that the
Company would be required to issue pursuant to the conversion or exercise of
all options, rights and securities convertible into or exercisable for shares
of Company Common Stock or otherwise) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ");

foreign antitrust, competition or similar Law shall not have expired or been
terminated;

consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (B) there shall be pending any
Action initiated or brought by any Governmental Authority seeking to enjoin,

(ii) (A)(1) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall have occurred
any event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect or (2) (x) any representation or warranty
of the Company set forth in _Section 4.2 _(Capitalization) of the Merger
Agreement shall not be true and correct in all but _de minimis_ respects, (y)
any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in _Section 4.1_
(Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, Etc.), _Section 4.3_ (Authority;

of the Merger Agreement (other than the representations and warranties
referred to in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y)) shall not be true and
correct, other than for such failures to be true and correct that have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, in each case with respect to the

terms or shall have been amended in accordance with its terms to provide for

may be asserted by Merger Sub or Parent regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to such condition, in whole or in part at any applicable time or
from time to time in their sole discretion prior to the expiration of the
Offer, and all conditions (except for the Minimum Condition) may be waived by
Parent or Merger Sub in their sole discretion in whole or in part at any
applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC. The failure of Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not otherwise defined shall have
the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
to which this _Annex A_ is attached (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").

     | Re: | _Notice Pursuant to Treasury Regulations § 1.897-2(h)(2)_ 
---|---|--- 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

At the request of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (" _Buyer_ "), in
connection with the disposition of outstanding shares of capital stock of
Obagi Medical Products, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Corporation_ "),
the Corporation provided the attached statement to Buyer on the date hereof.
This notice is provided pursuant to the requirements of Treasury Regulations §
1.897-2(h)(2). A copy of a certificate, dated as of the date of this notice,
furnished to Buyer by the Corporation under Treasury Regulations § 1.897-2(h)
(the " _FIRPTA Certificate_ ") is attached hereto.

The following information relates to the Corporation, which is providing this
notice:

    Name: |  | Obagi Medical Products, Inc. 
  Address: |  | 3760 Kilroy Airport Way, Suite 500

States real property interest," as that term is defined in § 897(c)(1)(A) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") because the
Corporation is not, and has not been within the five-year period preceding the
date hereof, a "United States real property holding corporation" as that term
is defined in § 897(c)(2) of the Code.

Under penalties of perjury, the undersigned, an officer of the Corporation,

7.1(f) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of [ _DATE_ ], by
and among the Corporation, Buyer and Merger Sub (as defined therein) (the "
_Agreement_ ").

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), provides that a transferee of a "United States real property interest"
must withhold tax if the transferor is not a United States person. In order to
confirm that Buyer, as transferee, is not required to withhold tax upon its
acquisition of all the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation, the
undersigned, an officer of the Corporation and solely in the capacity of an
officer of the Corporation, hereby certifies as follows:



     | 1. | The stock of the Corporation does not constitute a "United
States real property interest," as that term is defined in Section
897(c)(1)(A) of the Code;  
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | The determination in _Paragraph 1_ above is based on a
determination by the Corporation that the Corporation is not, and has not been
a "United States real property holding corporation," as that term is defined
in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, during the five-year period ending on the
date hereof; 
---|---|--- 



     | 3. | The Corporations federal employer identification number is
22-3904668; and

Internal Revenue Service by Buyer and that any false statement contained
herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment or both. 

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true, correct, and
complete, and I further declare that I have the authority to sign this
document on behalf of the Corporation.
