any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable
state securities Law. Purchaser acknowledges that the Securities are not

and that the Securities may not be sold except pursuant to the registration
provisions of the Securities Act or pursuant to an applicable exemption

identified therein have committed, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein to TRC (together
with any alternative financing obtained in accordance with Section 6.4(a), the

modification is contemplated and (iii) none of the commitments contained in

otherwise modified in any respect. The Financing Commitment is in full force

side contracts, arrangements or understandings (except for customary fee
letters and engagement letters, true and complete copies of which have been
provided to Seller, with only fee amounts redacted, none of which redactions
would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability,

accuracy of Seller's representations contained in Article V and Seller's and
Willbros' compliance with its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
TRC under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Financing
Commitment. As of the date of this Agreement and assuming the accuracy of
Seller's representations contained in Article V and Seller's and Willbros'
compliance with its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, TRC does not have
any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
term or condition of the Financing Commitment required to be satisfied by it
or that any portion of the Financing to be made thereunder will otherwise not
be available to TRC on a timely basis to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. TRC has fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees required by the terms of the Financing Commitment to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such
amounts due on or before the Closing Date. Subject to satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and performance by Seller of its
obligations under this Agreement: the proceeds from the Financing will provide Purchaser with
funds, together with funds on hand, at the Closing, sufficient for Purchaser
to satisfy all of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement, including the
obligations under Article III, and to effect the Closing on the terms
contemplated hereby.

taxes that might be owed with respect to such payment or benefit.

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the Closing if
the conditions thereto are satisfied, and (v) comply in all material respects
with its covenants and other obligations under the Financing Commitment and
the Definitive Financing Documentation. In the event that TRC commences an

terms that will still enable TRC and Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. TRC and Purchaser shall deliver to Seller true and
complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide TRC with any portion of the Financing.

Definitive Financing Documentation. TRC shall not agree to any amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights
under or terminate, the Financing Commitment or the Definitive Financing
Documentation in any manner that is reasonably expected to impair, delay or
prevent the funding or Financing described therein or the occurrence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, without Seller's
prior written consent; provided, that TRC may (x) amend, supplement, modify or
replace the Financing Commitment and (y) replace all or a portion of the
facility committed under the Financing Commitment as in effect as of the date
hereof with one or more debt or equity financings in a manner that does not
impair, delay or prevent the completion of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Purchaser and TRC shall keep Seller reasonably informed on a
current basis of the status of their efforts to arrange, obtain and consummate
the Financing. Purchaser and TRC shall give Seller oral and written notice
promptly after Purchaser or TRC becomes aware (i) of the occurrence of any
material breach, default or repudiation by any party to the Financing
Commitment or Definitive Financing Documentation or of any condition therein
being not reasonably being expected to be satisfied, (ii) of the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from any source of Financing
with respect to any (A) actual or potential material breach, default,
termination or repudiation of any provisions of the Financing Commitment or
the Definitive Financing Documentation, in each case by any party thereto, or
(B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the
Financing Commitment or the Definitive Financing Documentation, (iii) of any
termination or material waiver, amendment or other modification of the
Financing Commitment or the Definitive Financing Documentation, (iv) that any
of the parties to the Financing Commitment no longer intends to provide the
Financing, (v) that any portion of the Financing is not available to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (vi) the
occurrence of any event or development that Purchaser or TRC determines would
reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of TRC to obtain all or
any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment and the
Definitive Financing Documentation. As soon as reasonably practicable,
Purchaser and TRC shall provide any information reasonably requested by Seller
relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence. Each of TRC and Purchaser acknowledges that its obligation to
consummate the Transactions is not conditioned upon the availability or
consummation of the Financing.



(b)From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller and Willbros shall
cause each of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, employees and advisors, including legal and accounting, to provide

information memorandum and other marketing and information materials relating
to the Financing, (vi) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and

required to provide cooperation under this Section that: (A) unreasonably
interferes with the ongoing business of such Company or Company Subsidiary;
(B) causes any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached;
(C) causes any closing condition set forth in this Agreement to fail to be
satisfied; or (D) requires such Company or Company Subsidiary or its
respective directors, officers, managers or employees to execute, deliver or
enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument, including any
Financing Agreement, with respect to the Financing that would be effective
prior to the Closing. In no event shall any Company or Company Subsidiary be
required to pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any expense in
connection with assisting Purchaser or TRC in arranging the Financing or as a
result of any information provided by any Company or Company Subsidiary or any
of their Affiliates or representatives in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or in any other agreement
between a Company or a Company Subsidiary and Purchaser (or its Affiliates),
Seller and Willbros agree that Purchaser and its Affiliates may share
confidential information regarding the Companies or Company Subsidiaries and
their respective businesses with the Financing Sources, and that Purchaser,
its Affiliates and such Financing Sources may share such information with
potential financing sources in connection with the Financing, provided that
the recipients of such information agree to customary (including "click
through") confidentiality arrangements. In no event shall Seller, Willbros,
any Company or any Company Subsidiary be required to provide any financial
statements other than pursuant to, and solely as and to the extent required
by, Section 6.9.



6.5. Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules. From time to time prior to
the Closing, Seller and Willbros shall have the right to supplement or amend
the Schedules with respect to any matter occurring after the delivery of the
Schedules pursuant to this Agreement that, if occurring prior to the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Schedules. No such supplement or amendment shall have any effect on the
satisfaction of the condition to Closing set forth in Section 7.1(a) or
Purchaser's right to indemnification set forth in ARTICLE IX; provided,
however, that if (i) any such supplement or amendment to the Company
Disclosure Schedule identifies a matter that constitutes a Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) Seller and Willbros confirm to Purchaser in writing that such
matter constitutes a Material Adverse Effect and that Purchaser has a right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(b) by reason of such
supplement and amendment, and (iii) Purchaser proceeds with the Closing, then
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any right or claim for
indemnification pursuant to ARTICLE IX, with respect to such matters disclosed pursuant to any such supplement or
amendment at or prior to the Closing.



6.6. Confidentiality. Unless and until the transactions contemplated hereby
have been consummated, Purchaser shall, and shall ensure that its
Representatives and other agents shall, hold all confidential information
obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby from the
Companies, the Company Subsidiaries, Willbros, or Seller or any of their
respective Representatives, in accordance with and subject to the terms of the

Affiliate of Willbros other than any Company or Company Subsidiary and (ii) to
obtain any required consents of any applicable landlords or other third
parties to such assignments.

DRA/CLP Colonnade Office Birmingham LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,
as lessor, and Willbros Engineers, LLC, a Louisiana limited liabiliby company
now known as Wink Engineering, L.L.C. (a former subsidiary of Seller) and (ii)
to obtain any required consents of any applicable landlord or other third
parties to such assignments.



(c)From the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to negotiate the replacement of each lease guaranty of
Willbros under the Guaranteed Leases with a guaranty of Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates, guaranteeing the performance of the lessee party to such
Guaranteed Leases, to be effective as of the Closing or as soon thereafter as
practicable, in each case acceptable to Seller; provided, that if any such
replacement guaranty will not be effective as of the Closing, then at the
Closing, Purchaser shall provide to Seller a guaranty of Purchaser on the same
terms as the lease guaranty of Willbros under any such Guaranteed Lease,
acceptable to Seller.



6.9. Historic Financial Statements. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide to Purchaser within 80 days after the date hereof, and in
any event no later than 55 days after the Closing Date, (i) the audited
consolidated statements of income, equity and cash flows for the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries for the last fiscal year completed prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) the audited consolidated balance sheets of the Companies
and Company Subsidiaries for the last fiscal year completed prior to the
Closing Date (in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), together with the notes
thereto and accompanied by an unqualified opinion of PricewaterhouseCoopers,
LLP) (together with the statements in clause (i), the "Required Audited
Financial Statements"). As soon as reasonably practicable and in any event no
later than 55 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements together with notes
thereto for any interim period and the corresponding period of the prior year
completed prior to the Closing Date since the date of the balance sheets
referred to in the preceding sentence (the "Required Interim Financial
Statements" and, with the Required Audited Financial Statements, the "Required
Financial Statements"). In all cases these Required Financial Statements shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with prior periods.
Purchaser shall be responsible for Seller's reasonable out of pocket costs in
preparing the aforesaid financial statements. Seller shall cooperate with
Purchaser to facilitate periodic conferences with PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP
to obtain updates on the status and progress of the delivery of the Required
Audited Financial Statements. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability
or obligation to indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees for any breach of this
Section 6.9 in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate.



6.10. Agreements relating to Intercompany Service Arrangements. Arrangements
whereby services are currently being provided by the Companies or Company
Subsidiaries to Seller or an Affiliate thereof, including but not limited to
the matters referred to as the Dominion UDT ROW project, shall be memorialized
by mutually agreeable contracts.



6.11. Employee Matters. Upon Purchaser's reasonable request, Seller shall
provide Purchaser with a list of all employees whose work hours have been
reduced within six months preceding the Closing Date, which list will indicate
the employee's name, site of employment, position or job title, starting date
of employment, date on which the reduction in work hours commenced, and the
amount of hour reduction. Such list shall be updated from time to time by the
Company to reflect departures and other changes to the Company Personnel
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.



6.12. NAVFAC Contract. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the NAVFAC Contract and the associated current assets (including
receivables thereunder) to be assigned by Government Services to, and the
associated current liabilities (including payroll obligations, other payables,
and accrued liabilities related thereto) to be assumed by, Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller other than the Companies or Company Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing. Seller and Willbros shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of the customer to the foregoing assignment
prior to the Closing. If such consent cannot be obtained prior to the Closing,
then (i) notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none
of the current assets or current liabilities related to the NAVFAC Contract
shall be included in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, (ii)
Seller, Willbros and Purchaser shall continue to seek the consent of the
customer to the assignment thereof, and (iii) Seller and Purchaser shall enter
into an appropriate and reasonable alternative arrangement whereby Seller will
obtain all of the practical benefit and burden of the NAVFAC Contract,
including the associated current assets (including receivables thereunder) and
associated current liabilities (including payroll obligations, other payables,
and accrued liabilities related thereto).

pursuant to, or necessary or proper in order to give effect to, all of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement. 8.2. Publicity. No public release or announcement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be made without advance written
approval thereof from Purchaser and Seller (which, after the Closing, shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Purchaser and TRC, on the one hand,
and Seller and Willbros, on the other, agree to cooperate in issuing any press
release or other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Whenever practicable, Purchaser and Willbros
shall each furnish to the other drafts of all such press releases or
announcements prior to their release. Nothing contained in this Section 8.2
shall prevent (a) either party from at any time furnishing any information to
any Authority or from making any disclosures required under applicable Law,
including the Securities Exchange Act, or under the rules and regulations of
any national securities exchange on which such party's shares of capital
stock, or the shares of capital stock of such party's ultimate parent
corporation, are listed, (b) subject to Section 6.6, either party from
furnishing any information concerning the transactions contemplated hereby to
such party's stockholders, Affiliates or other Representatives who have a need
to know such information or (c) Seller from communicating with other potential

so long as the identity of Purchaser and specific terms of this Agreement are
not disclosed.

Companies and the Company Subsidiaries relating to their respective operations
prior to Closing will be acquired by Purchaser in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that Seller may from
time to time require access to or copies of such records for Tax reporting,
legal compliance, litigation, claims, insurance requirements, audits and other
legitimate business purposes. Purchaser agrees that, upon reasonable prior
notice from Seller, it shall, during normal business hours, provide or cause
to be provided to Seller access to or copies of such records to be used solely
for such purposes; provided that Purchaser shall not be obligated to provide
any such records to the extent such provision would result in the loss or
waiver of any legal privilege attached thereto. Purchaser agrees that it shall
not (and shall cause each of its Affiliates, including the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries, not to), within six years after the Closing Date,
destroy any material business records of the Companies or Company Subsidiaries
prepared prior to the Closing and, in any event, shall not destroy any
material business records without first notifying Seller and affording Seller
at least 90 days to remove or copy such records.



8.4. Investigation; No Reliance by Purchaser; Knowledge of Purchaser.



(a)Purchaser acknowledges (i) that it and its Representatives have undertaken
an independent investigation, examination, analysis and verification of the
Companies and the Company Subsidiaries and the business, assets, operations,
financial condition and prospects of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries, including Purchaser's own estimate of the value of the business
of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) that it has had the
opportunity to visit with the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and Seller
and meet with their respective Representatives to discuss the business and the
assets, liabilities, financial condition, cash flow and operations of the
Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, (iii) that all materials and
information requested by Purchaser have been provided to Purchaser to
Purchaser's reasonable satisfaction, and (iv) that it has undertaken such due
diligence (including a review of the assets, liabilities, books, records and
contracts of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries) as Purchaser deems
adequate, including that described above. In connection with such
investigation, Purchaser and its Representatives have received from or on
behalf of Seller and/or the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries certain
estimates, budgets, forecasts, plans and financial projections (collectively,
"Forward-Looking Statements"). Purchaser acknowledges that (x) there are
uncertainties inherent in making Forward-Looking Statements and (y) it is
familiar with such uncertainties and it is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Forward-Looking
Statements so furnished to it and its Representatives (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying Forward-Looking Statements where such assumptions are
explicitly disclosed). Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in
any Transaction Document, neither Seller, Willbros, the Companies, the Company
Subsidiaries nor any other Person is making any representation or warranty
with respect to Forward-Looking Statements.

Company Subsidiaries or their Affiliates or any of their Representatives,
except for those representations and warranties of Seller and Willbros
expressly set forth in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.



(c)Purchaser's rights under this Agreement, including rights to
indemnification, will not be affected by any investigation conducted or
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Purchaser or its
Affiliates or Representatives at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing. Each of Seller and
Willbros hereby acknowledges that, regardless of any investigation made (or
not made) by or on behalf of Purchaser, and regardless of the results of any
such investigation, Purchaser has entered into this Agreement in express
reliance upon the representations and warranties of Seller and Willbros set
forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

8.5. Exculpation and Indemnification of Directors and Officers. For a period
of six years after the Closing Date, to the maximum extent permitted by law,
Purchaser shall cause the Companies and Company Subsidiaries to maintain
provisions in its Organizational Documents relating to exculpation or
indemnification of former officers and directors or managers, as applicable,
holding office prior to the Closing Date that are at least as favorable to
such former officers, directors, or managers as those in effect as of the date
hereof.



8.6. Limitation of Representations and Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any
other Transaction Document, Seller is not making and shall not be deemed to
have made any other representations or warranties, written or oral, statutory,
express or implied, concerning the Securities, the Companies, the Company
Subsidiaries or the business, assets or liabilities of the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, NEITHER
SELLER NOR WILBROS HAS MADE, AND SELLER AND WILLBROS HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
AND NEGATE, AND PURCHASER HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES, ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AT COMMON LAW, BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO
THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR MATERIALITY OF ANY INFORMATION, DATA OR OTHER
MATERIALS (WRITTEN OR ORAL) OR DOCUMENTS HERETOFORE FURNISHED OR MADE
AVAILABLE TO PURCHASER AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE
COMPANIES, THE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, SELLER or WILLBROS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT
OR IN ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, NONE OF THE COMPANIES, THE COMPANY
SUBSIDIARIES, SELLER NOR WILLBROS IS MAKING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY TO
PURCHASER WITH RESPECT TO ANY FORWARD‑LOOKING STATEMENTS OR THE INFORMATION
SET FORTH IN ANY SUMMARY, TEASER, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION MEMORANDUM OR
MANAGEMENT PRESENTATION DELIVERED TO PURCHASER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES.

 8.7. Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs. Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the
Companies and the Company Subsidiaries not to, take any action following the
Closing that could result in liability under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, as amended, without complying with such Act.



8.8. Seller Intellectual Property; Name Change.

(a)No more than 60 days following the Closing, Purchaser shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that neither Purchaser, the Companies, the Company
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives use the
Seller Marks at any time for any reason. All links between any domain name
included within the assets of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries and
any domain names of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be removed promptly
after the Closing. After the Closing, Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in
taking all actions necessary to complete these actions.



(b)As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, but in any event
no more than 30 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause each of the
Companies and the Company Subsidiaries to (i) amend its certificate of
formation or articles of incorporation to change the name therein to a name
not including or similar to "Willbros," and (ii) amend or terminate any
certificate of assumed name or "doing business as" filing so as to eliminate
its right to use, and all references to, the name "Willbros."



8.9. Company Intellectual Property. Subject to the provisions of the
Transition Services Agreement, all links between any domain names of Seller or
any of its Affiliates and any domain names of the Companies or the Company
Subsidiaries shall be removed promptly after the Closing. After the Closing,
Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in taking all actions necessary to
complete these actions. To the extent that Seller or any of its Affiliates
controls or possesses any websites or other property of the Companies or the
Company Subsidiaries, Seller shall, promptly after Closing, cause the control
or possession of such websites or other property to be provided to Purchaser.



8.10. Employees; Benefit Plans.



(a)During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the date which is
12 months from the Closing (or if earlier, the date of the employee's
termination of employment with any Company), Purchaser shall provide (or shall
cause the respective Companies or their Affiliate to provide, as applicable),
each employee who is employed by any Company or Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Closing who remains employed by a Company or a Company Subsidiary
immediately after the Closing ("Company Continuing Employee") with: (i) base
salary or hourly wages which are no less than the base salary or hourly wages
provided by the applicable Company or Company Subsidiary immediately prior to
the Closing; (ii) target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation), if any, which are no less than, at Purchaser's option, (A) the
target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation) provided by
the applicable Company or Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing
or (B) the target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation)
provided by Purchaser or its Affiliates to their similarly situated employees
during such period; (iii) retirement and welfare benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than, at Purchaser's option, (A) those provided by
the applicable Company immediately prior to the Closing or (B) those provided
by Purchaser or its Affiliates to their similarly situated employees during
such period; and (iv) severance benefits that are no less favorable than, at
Purchaser's option (A) the practice, plan or policy in effect for such Company
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing or (B) the practice, plan
or policy provided by Parent or its Affiliates to their similarly situated
employees during such period.

 (b)With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Purchaser Benefit Plans") in which any Company
Continuing Employees will participate effective as of or after the Closing,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Companies to, recognize all service of the
Company Continuing Employees with the Companies as if such service were with
Purchaser, for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not benefit accrual) in
any Purchaser Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate after the Closing Date; provided, however, such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits or (y) such service was not recognized
under the corresponding Benefit Plan. Purchaser agrees to accept a direct
transfer or rollover of assets from the defined contribution 401(k) Plan in
which the Company Continuing Employees participated prior to the Closing,
including, but not limited to, outstanding loans under such defined
contribution 401(k) Plan.



(c)Purchaser shall assume responsibility for providing COBRA notice and
coverage to any MandA qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.
Section 54.4980B-9, Q/A-4) who experience a qualifying event as of or after
the Closing. Seller shall retain or assume, as applicable, responsibility for
providing any remaining period of COBRA coverage for any qualified
beneficiaries who experienced a qualifying event prior to the Closing and who
were formerly employed by any Company or Company Subsidiary.



(d)This Section 8.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 8.10,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 8.10. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend
or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 8.10
shall not create any right in any employee or any other Person to any
continued employment with any Company, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.



8.11. Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition.



(a)From the Closing until the third anniversary of the date hereof, Seller and
Willbros shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, on behalf of itself or any other Person solicit, bid
for, entice, induce, cause or encourage, directly or indirectly, any Person
who is a customer or supplier of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries to
reduce or end their business with the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that soliciting, bidding for, enticing, inducing, causing
and encouraging any Person to hire or otherwise use Seller, Willbros or any of
their respective Affiliates for services that are not Covered Services (as
defined below) shall not constitute a violation of this Section 8.11(a).



(b)From the Closing until the third anniversary of the date hereof, Seller and
Willbros shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, on behalf of itself or any other Person, solicit the
employment of, enter into a Contract with or otherwise solicit, entice,
induce, cause or encourage, directly or indirectly, any employee, consultant,
independent contractor, sales or other representative of the Companies or the
Company Subsidiaries to leave the employ or service of the Companies or the
Company Subsidiaries; provided, however, that none of Seller, Willbros, and
their respective Affiliates shall be prohibited from employing any employee,
consultant, independent contractor, sales or other representative of the
Companies or the Company Subsidiaries who contacts Seller, Willbros, or their
respective Affiliates in response to a general solicitation not targeted at
employees of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries or who contacts Seller,
Willbros, or their respective Affiliates on his or her own initiative and without any direct or indirect solicitation or other violation
of this Section 8.11(b) by Seller, Willbros, or their respective Affiliates.



(c)From the Closing until the third anniversary of the date hereof and subject
to Section 8.11(d) below, Seller and Willbros shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates not to, whether directly or indirectly, on their behalf
or on behalf of any other Person, engage in the business of providing
engineering services for the oil and gas industry or other services of the
type currently provided by the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries (the
"Covered Services") anywhere in North America (including its associated
islands, coastal waters, territories and regions, collectively, the
"Territory"), including by (i) establishing a Person which engages in Covered
Services anywhere in the Territory (a "Competing Entity"), (ii) making any
investment in or acquiring any equity interest or other interest (as owner,
lender, principal, member, general or limited partner, stockholder, or
otherwise) in, a Competing Entity, or (iii) participating in the management
(as an officer, director, manager, independent contractor, employee, or
otherwise) of a Competing Entity. Seller, Willbros and Purchaser acknowledge
that the covenants contained in this Section 8.14(c) are a material inducement
to the willingness of Purchaser to enter into this Agreement without which
Purchaser would not have consummated the transactions contemplated hereby and
are being granted to maintain or preserve the goodwill value of the Companies
and the Company Subsidiaries and fair market value of the equity interests
acquired hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ownership by Seller or
Willbros, directly or indirectly, of not more than five percent of the issued
and outstanding stock of a company the shares of which are regularly traded on
a national securities exchange or over the counter market shall not be a
violation of this Section 8.14(c).



(d)For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement
shall restrict Seller, Willbros or any of their Affiliates from advertising
for, soliciting, bidding or performing (i) Construction Services, (ii)
Electrical Transmission, Distribution and Related Work, (iii) EPC and EPCM
projects in which the engineering portion of any such project is performed by
others than Seller, Willbros or any of their Affiliates, or (iv) any services
of the type currently being performed by Seller, Willbros or any of their
Affiliates other than the Companies or Company Subsidiaries.



(e)Without limiting Section 12.6, if at any time a court or arbitrator's award
holds that the restrictions in this Section 8.11 are unreasonable under
circumstances then existing, Seller, Willbros and Purchaser agree that the
maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances
shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area. Seller, Willbros
and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that any breach of the provisions
contained in this Section 8.11 will result in serious and irreparable injury
and therefore money damages would not be an adequate remedy for any such
breach; and therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any
provisions of this Section 8.11 that is continuing, Purchaser, in addition to
other rights and remedies existing in its favor, shall be entitled to specific
performance or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce, or prevent any
violations of, the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other
security). In addition, in the event of a breach of this Section 8.11, the
period of noncompetition or non-solicitation, as applicable, shall be tolled
until such breach has been duly cured.



8.12. Notifications of Customers. At Purchaser's request, Seller and Willbros
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and each of their
respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in
Purchaser's efforts to notify all of the customers and vendors and other
commercial counterparties of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries that
ownership of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries has been transferred
to Purchaser and facilitating the transition of such customers, vendors and
other commercial counterparties to Purchaser; provided, that Purchaser shall,
upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all documented and reasonable out
of pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller, Willbros or their respective
Affiliates in connection with any such cooperation. If the economic benefits
of any services performed by the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries (whether
before or after Closing), or any other payments or other funds due to the
Companies or the Company Subsidiaries, are received by Seller, Willbros or any
of their respective Affiliates from and after the Closing, Seller or Willbros,
as applicable, shall take such reasonable actions as are necessary to ensure
that Purchaser receives such economic benefits or other payments or funds. If
the economic benefits of any services performed by Seller, Willbros or any of
their Affiliates (whether before or after Closing), or any other payments or
other funds due to Seller, Willbros or any of their Affiliates, are received
by Purchaser, any of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates from and after the Closing, Purchaser or such Company or
Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall take such reasonable actions as are
necessary to ensure that Seller, Willbros or their Affiliate receives such
economic benefits or other payments or funds.

(a)Willbros hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary
obligor and not merely a surety (the "Seller Guarantor"), to and for the
benefit of Purchaser and the Purchaser Indemnitees, the complete and punctual
performance and observance by Seller of all of the covenants, undertakings,
warranties and other obligations (conditional or otherwise) of whatever nature
(collectively, "Seller Obligations") of Seller in, or pursuant to, the terms
of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document, including, on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, any and all payment obligations of
Seller under ARTICLE IX of this Agreement. The liability of the Seller
Guarantor for the Seller Obligations of Seller arising under this Section 8.13
shall not be released or diminished by forbearance, neglect or delay in
seeking performance of the obligations hereby imposed or any granting of time
of such performance.



(b)Willbros hereby agrees that Seller and Purchaser may at any time and from
time to time, without notice to or further consent of Willbros, extend the
time of payment of any of the Seller Obligations, and may also make any
agreement with Seller for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise,
discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, without in any way
impairing or affecting Willbros' obligations under this Section 8.13. Willbros
hereby waives all general guarantor and suretyship defenses (other than
defenses to the performance of the Seller Obligations that are available to
Seller under the Agreement (other than due to the rejection of the Agreement
in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency of Seller)).



(c)If and whenever Seller defaults for any reason whatsoever in the
performance of any Seller Obligations undertaken or expressed to be undertaken
by it in, or pursuant to, the terms of this Agreement, the Seller Guarantor
shall forthwith upon demand unconditionally perform (or procure performance
of) and satisfy (or procure satisfaction of) the relevant Seller Obligation so
that the same benefits will be conferred on the Purchaser as would have been
received if such Seller Obligation had been duly performed and/or satisfied by
Seller.



(d)The guarantee provided in this Section 8.13 is to be a continuing guarantee
and accordingly it is to remain in force until all of the Seller Obligations
of Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall
have been performed and satisfied regardless of the legality, validity or
enforceability of any of the provisions of this Agreement and notwithstanding
the winding up, liquidation, receivership, examinership, insolvency,
bankruptcy (or any process related thereto), dissolution or other incapacity
of Seller or any change in status, control or ownership of Seller. The
guarantee provided in this Section 8.13 is in addition to and without
limiting, and not in substitution for, any rights or security which Purchaser
may now or hereafter have or hold for the performance and observance of any
covenants, undertakings, warranties and other obligations of Seller given in
or pursuant to this Agreement.

 (e)As a separate and independent covenant, the Seller Guarantor
unconditionally agrees that any Seller Obligation expressed to be undertaken
by Seller (including without limitation any monies expressed to be payable
under this Agreement) which may not be enforceable against or recoverable from
Seller by reason of any legal limitation, disability or incapacity on or of
Seller or any fact or circumstance (other than any limitation imposed by this
Agreement) shall nevertheless be enforceable against the Seller Guarantor as
though the same had been incurred by the Seller Guarantor and the Seller
Guarantor was the sole or principal obligor in respect thereof and shall be
performed or paid by the Seller Guarantor on demand.



8.14. TRC Companies, Inc.



(a)TRC hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor
and not merely a surety (the "Purchaser Guarantor"), to and for the benefit of
Seller and the Seller Indemnitees, the complete and punctual performance and
observance by Purchaser of all of the covenants, undertakings, warranties and
other obligations (conditional or otherwise) of whatever nature (collectively,
"Purchaser Obligations") of Purchaser in, or pursuant to, the terms of this
Agreement and each other Transaction Document, including, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, any and all payment obligations of
Seller under ARTICLE IX of this Agreement. The liability of the Purchaser
Guarantor for the Purchaser Obligations of Purchaser arising under this
Section 8.14 shall not be released or diminished by forbearance, neglect or
delay in seeking performance of the obligations hereby imposed or any granting
of time of such performance.



(b)TRC hereby agrees that Seller and Purchaser may at any time and from time
to time, without notice to or further consent of TRC, extend the time of
payment of any of the Purchaser Obligations, and may also make any agreement
with Purchaser for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or
release thereof, in whole or in part, without in any way impairing or
affecting TRC's obligations under this Section 8.14. TRC hereby waives all
general guarantor and suretyship defenses (other than defenses to the
performance of the Purchaser Obligations that are available to Purchaser under
the Agreement (other than due to the rejection of the Agreement in the context
of a bankruptcy or insolvency of Purchaser)).



(c)If and whenever Purchaser defaults for any reason whatsoever in the
performance of any Purchaser Obligations undertaken or expressed to be
undertaken by it in, or pursuant to, the terms of this Agreement, the
Purchaser Guarantor shall forthwith upon demand unconditionally perform (or
procure performance of) and satisfy (or procure satisfaction of) the relevant
Purchaser Obligation so that the same benefits will be conferred on Seller as
would have been received if such Purchaser Obligation had been duly performed
and/or satisfied by Purchaser.



(d)The guarantee provided in this Section 8.14 is to be a continuing guarantee
and accordingly it is to remain in force until all of the Purchaser
Obligations of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document shall have been performed and satisfied regardless of the legality,
validity or enforceability of any of the provisions of this Agreement and
notwithstanding the winding up, liquidation, receivership, examinership,
insolvency, bankruptcy (or any process related thereto), dissolution or other
incapacity of Seller or any change in status, control or ownership of
Purchaser. The guarantee provided in this Section 8.14 is in addition to and
without limiting, and not in substitution for, any rights or security which
Seller may now or hereafter have or hold for the performance and observance of
any covenants, undertakings, warranties and other obligations of Purchaser
given in or pursuant to this Agreement.



(e)As a separate and independent covenant, the Purchaser Guarantor
unconditionally agrees that any Purchaser Obligation expressed to be
undertaken by Purchaser (including without limitation any monies expressed to be payable under this Agreement) which may not be
enforceable against or recoverable from Purchaser by reason of any legal
limitation, disability or incapacity on or of Purchaser or any fact or
circumstance (other than any limitation imposed by this Agreement) shall
nevertheless be enforceable against the Purchaser Guarantor as though the same
had been incurred by the Purchaser Guarantor and the Purchaser Guarantor was
the sole or principal obligor in respect thereof and shall be performed or
paid by the Purchaser Guarantor on demand.

9.2. Indemnification.

(a)By Seller. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, from and
after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnitees from and against any Damages which any such Purchaser Indemnitee
shall suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a result of (i) the breach by
Seller of any of the representations and warranties made by Seller in this
Agreement (in each case, as the representations or warranties of the Seller
would read if all qualifications as to materiality, including each reference
to the words "Material Adverse Change", "Material Adverse Effect", "material"
and "materially" and all similar phrases and words, were deleted therefrom) or
the other Transaction Documents, (ii) the breach by Seller of any of its

agreements contained in this Agreement.



9.3. Third Party Claims. 

(a)If any Purchaser Indemnitee desires to make a claim against Seller, or any
Seller Indemnitee desires to make a claim against Purchaser (such Purchaser
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, an "Indemnified Person") under Section 9.2 in
connection with any action, suit, proceeding or demand at any time instituted
against or made upon such Indemnified Person by any third party for which such
Indemnified Person may seek indemnification hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"),
whether or not subject to the Aggregate Deductible, such Indemnified Person
shall promptly notify in writing, in the case of a claim under Section 9.2(a),
Seller, or, in the case of a claim under Section 9.2(b), Purchaser (in each
case, an "Indemnifying Party"), of such Third Party Claim and of the
Indemnified Person's claim of indemnification with respect thereto; provided,
however, that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially and actually prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying
Party shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice to notify such
Indemnified Person if the applicable Indemnifying Party has elected to assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim (i)
involving any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, (ii) in which relief other than monetary damages are sought, or
(iii) if the Third Party Claim relates to Taxes (except as otherwise provided
in ARTICLE X). In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
maintain control of the defense of any Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying
Party has failed or is failing to defend in good faith the Third Party Claim.
If the applicable Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be entitled at its own
expense to conduct and control the defense and settlement of such Third Party
Claim through counsel of its own choosing (reasonably acceptable to the
applicable Indemnified Person) on behalf of the applicable Indemnified Person.
If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Person within 30
days after receipt of notice from the Indemnified Person of a Third Party
Claim that the applicable Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim at the expense of the applicable
Indemnifying Party through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying
Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may not compromise or
settle any Third Party Claim except as provided in Section 9.3(b). If, after
assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party determines
that it is not required to provide indemnification therefor, it shall promptly
notify the Indemnified Party, cease to control the defense thereof and shall
nonetheless be responsible for all costs of defense incurred by it prior to
such notice.



(b)Any compromise, settlement or offer of settlement of any Third Party Claim
of which the applicable Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense
shall require the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Unless such consent is
obtained, the applicable Indemnifying Party shall continue the defense of such
claim; provided, however, that, if any Indemnified Person refuses its consent
to a bona fide offer of settlement that (i) the applicable Indemnifying Party
wishes to accept, (ii) contemplates the entry of a final, non-appealable order
by a court of competent jurisdiction or the binding and due execution and
delivery of a settlement agreement, in each case in full satisfaction and
resolution of the relevant Third Party Claim, (iii) involves no payment of
money by any Purchaser Indemnitee (if such Indemnified Person is a Purchaser
Indemnitee) or Seller Indemnitee (if such Indemnified Person is a Seller
Indemnitee), (iv) involves no admission of guilt or wrong-doing and no
injunctive or non-monetary relief or other limitation on the future operation
of the business of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a
whole), (v) is not conditioned upon, coupled with, or otherwise related to or
otherwise results in (or could reasonably be expected to result in) the
waiver, termination, relinquishment, interpretation or amendment of any actual
or asserted rights of such Indemnified Person or any Purchaser Indemnitee (if such Indemnified Person is a Purchaser
Indemnitee) or Seller Indemnitee (if such Indemnified Person is a Seller
Indemnitee), and (vi) expressly and unconditionally releases such Indemnified
Person and the Purchaser Indemnitees (if such Indemnified Person is a
Purchaser Indemnitee) or Seller Indemnitees (if such Indemnified Person is a
Seller Indemnitee) from all liability in connection with such claim, the
applicable Indemnifying Party may reassign the defense of such claim to such
Indemnified Person, who may then continue to pursue the defense of such
matter, free of any participation by the Indemnifying Party, at the sole cost
and expense of such Indemnified Person. In the event of such an assignment,
the obligation of the applicable Indemnifying Party with respect thereto shall
not exceed the lesser of (i) the amount of the offer of settlement that such
Indemnified Person refused to accept or (ii) the aggregate Damages of the
Indemnified Person with respect to such claim, including the costs of defense
after reassignment of the defense of such claim to the Indemnified Person. Any
compromise, settlement or offer of settlement of any Third Party Claim of
which the applicable Indemnifying Party has not elected to assume the defense
or has reassigned the defense to the Indemnified Person shall require the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person may participate, at
its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, however,
that such Indemnified Person shall be entitled to participate in any such
defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i)
so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Person, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Party that would make such separate representation advisable; and provided,
further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more
than one such counsel for all Indemnified Persons in connection with any Third
Party Claim. So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of
any Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms hereof, the Indemnified
Person agrees that the Indemnifying Party shall have control over the conduct
of such proceeding to the extent provided herein. So long as the Indemnified
Person is conducting the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with
the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party agrees that the Indemnified Person
shall have control over the conduct of such proceeding to the extent provided
herein. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third Party
Claim, including the Indemnified Person providing the Indemnifying Party with
access to the Indemnified Person's records and personnel relating to any Third
Party Claim during reasonable hours under the circumstances.



(c)If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
rights and remedies of the Indemnified Person to any claims of the Indemnified
Person with respect to such Third Party Claim; provided, that (i) without
limitation of Section 9.4(e), Seller shall not be subrogated to any claims
under any insurance policies of the Purchaser Group and (ii) in no event shall
Seller be subrogated to any claims against any officer, director or employee
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or against any current or
prospective customer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.



9.4. Limitations on Indemnification.



(a)Deductible. Subject to the other limitations of this Section 9.4:



(i)No claim for indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than any such
claim relating to a breach of a Fundamental Representation or the
representation of Seller in Section 5.28 (Absence of Indebtedness)) shall be
made by any Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to any breach resulting in an individual item of Damages, or related items of
Damages arising out of substantially similar facts and circumstances, unless
and until the amount of such Damages suffered by the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and/or any other Purchaser Indemnitee exceeds
$65,000, at which point a claim may be made for the entire amount of such
Damages; and



(ii)No claim for indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than any such
claim relating to a breach of a Fundamental Representation or the
representation of Seller in Section 5.28 (Absence of Indebtedness)) shall be
made by any Purchaser Indemnitee unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Damages for which Purchaser Indemnitees are otherwise entitled to
indemnification under this ARTICLE IX exceeds an amount equal to one half of
one percent (0.5%) of the Enterprise Value (the "Aggregate Deductible"), and
then only to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds the
Aggregate Deductible;



(iii)No claim for indemnification under Section 9.2(b)(i) shall be made by any
Seller Indemnitee with respect to any breach resulting in an individual item
of Damages, or related items of Damages arising out of substantially similar
facts and circumstances, unless and until the amount of such Damages suffered
by the Seller Indemnitees exceeds $65,000, at which point a claim may be made
for the entire amount of such Damages; and



(iv)No claim for indemnification under Section 9.2(b)(i) shall be made by any
Seller Indemnitee unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages for
which Seller Indemnitees are otherwise entitled to indemnification under this
ARTICLE IX exceeds an amount equal to the Aggregate Deductible, and then only
to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds the Aggregate
Deductible.



(b)Cap. Subject to the other limitations of this Section 9.4, the aggregate
amount of all Damages payable (i) to all Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to
all claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than any
such claim relating to a breach of a Fundamental Representation or the
representation of Seller in Section 5.28 (Absence of Indebtedness)) shall not
exceed an amount equal to 10 percent of the Enterprise Value, and (ii) to all
Seller Indemnitees with respect to all claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2(b)(i) shall not exceed an amount equal to 10 percent of the
Enterprise Value. In no event shall (i) Seller's obligations with respect to
the indemnity provisions of Section 9.2(a) exceed an aggregate amount equal to
the Aggregate Purchase Price or (ii) Purchaser's obligations with respect to
the indemnity provisions of Section 9.2(b) exceed an aggregate amount equal to
the Aggregate Purchase Price.

(c)Time Limit. No Person shall be liable for any claim for indemnification
hereunder, whether or not as a result of a Third Party Claim, unless written
notice of a claim for indemnification is delivered by the Person seeking
indemnification to the Person from whom indemnification is sought with respect
to any such breach before the applicable Survival Date (in which case such
indemnification obligation shall survive the time at which it would otherwise
terminate pursuant to this ARTICLE IX regardless of when any Damages in
respect thereof may actually be incurred). All notices given pursuant hereto
shall set forth with reasonable specificity the basis for such claim for
indemnification.

(d)Closing Net Working Capital; Reserves. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification hereunder for any Damages as a result of any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller under ARTICLE V or the breach by Seller of any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, and the amount of any Damages shall not be
included in the calculation of aggregate Damages subject to the Aggregate
Deductible, to the extent that the amount of any Damages as a result of such
breach is taken into account as a current liability, reserved or accrued, or
otherwise accounted for, in determining the Closing Net Working Capital, or
otherwise taken into account in the calculation of Aggregate Purchase Price
(as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.3).

(e)Insurance Benefits; Other Indemnification. The amount of any Damages
subject to indemnification hereunder shall be calculated (i) net of any
amounts actually recovered Purchaser, the Companies or the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Purchaser Group") (net of costs of collection
and any associated increased cost of premiums) under insurance policies or
other collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities or contributions of
any Person which are contained outside this Agreement).

(f)Mitigation. Purchaser shall take and shall cause the Companies, the Company
Subsidiaries and any other Purchaser Indemnitees to use commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon members of the management of
Purchaser becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to,
or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum
extent reasonably necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the
Damages; provided, that the Purchaser Indemnitees' reasonable costs incurred
in connection with such mitigation efforts shall themselves be treated as
Damages and shall be paid or reimbursed by Seller. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be liable for any Damages to the
extent (but only to the extent) that the Purchaser Indemnitees are required
pursuant to this Section 9.4(f) to take commercially reasonable action to
mitigate any such Damages and do not take such action. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Purchaser Indemnitees
be required to assert or cause the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries to
assert any claim against any officer, director or employee of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or against any current or prospective customer
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

(g)No Special Damages. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, no Person shall be liable to any other Person for any exemplary or
punitive damages or for any consequential, incidental, indirect or special
damages of such other Person which would not have been reasonably foreseeable
to arise as a consequence of the applicable breach, in each case relating to
the breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or related hereto; provided, however, that nothing
shall prevent a Person from recovering any Damages, including punitive or
exemplary Damages, incurred by such Person in connection with a Third Party
Claim.

(h)Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification payments made by
Purchaser or Seller pursuant to this ARTICLE IX shall be treated by all
parties as an adjustment to the Aggregate Purchase Price hereunder.

(i)Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
Seller (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Financing,
the Financing Agreements or in respect of any other document or theory of law
or equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral
or written representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith
or therewith and Seller (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) agrees not to
commence any action or proceeding against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing, the Financing Agreements or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity and agrees to cause any such action or
proceeding asserted by Seller (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates,
directors. officers, employees, agents and representatives) in connection with
this Agreement, the Financing, the Financing Agreements or in respect of any
other document or theory of law or equity against any Financing Source to be
dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source shall
have any liability for any claims or damages to Seller in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing, the Financing Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.



9.5. Limitation of Remedies. Subject to Section 9.6 and except for the rights
of the parties pursuant to other Transaction Documents and for claims of, or
causes of action arising from, fraud, the indemnification rights contained in
this ARTICLE IX and ARTICLE X shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
parties after the Closing Date with respect to any breach of a representation,
warranty or other agreement contained in this Agreement. To the maximum extent
permitted by Law, Purchaser hereby waives and shall cause its Affiliates to
waive all rights and remedies with respect to any breach of the
representations, warranties or other agreements contained in this Agreement,
except for the rights to indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE IX and
ARTICLE X, and the rights of the parties pursuant to other Transaction
Documents and for claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud, whether
under any Laws (including any right or remedy under CERCLA or any other
Environmental, Health and Safety Law), at common law or otherwise, including
for rescission. Except as provided by this ARTICLE IX, no action, suit, claim,
proceeding or remedy shall be brought or maintained after the Closing Date by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including any other Purchaser Indemnitees,
successors or permitted assigns against Seller or any of its Affiliates, and
no recourse shall be brought or granted against Seller or any of its
Affiliates, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misstatement or omission
respecting a breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of Seller set forth or contained in this Agreement; provided,
however, that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict
the bringing or maintenance of any such claim or action, or the granting of
any such remedy, to the extent that the same shall have been the result of
intentional fraud by any such Person (and in the event of intentional fraud,
recourse shall only extend to those Persons committing intentional fraud).



9.6. Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that
any breach of this Agreement by either party hereto could not be adequately
compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition
to any other right or remedy to which Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
may be entitled, at law or in equity, such party shall be entitled to enforce
any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without the
necessity of posting any bond or other undertaking.





ARTICLE X.

TAX MATTERS



10.1. Tax Returns.

(a)Seller and Willbros shall prepare and cause to be filed all Returns of the
Companies and the Company Subsidiaries required to be filed for all Tax
Periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller and Willbros shall
deliver to Purchaser for its review a draft of each Return of the Companies
and the Company Subsidiaries to be filed after the Closing Date that may give rise to
any Tax liability over $50,000 not fewer than 30 days before the deadline for
filing such Return, including extensions (for the avoidance of doubt, Returns
of Seller's parent entity shall not be subject to the delivery and review
requirements of the foregoing sentence). Purchaser shall notify Seller in
writing if it objects to any portion of a draft Return within 15 days after
the draft Return is delivered to Purchaser. If Seller does not receive a
written objection (specifying in detail the nature of such objection) by the
end of such 15-day period, Seller may file the Return and such Return shall be
deemed final and binding as between the parties. If Purchaser notifies Seller
that it objects to any portion of the draft Return (specifying in detail the
nature of such objection) on or before the end of such 15-day period,
Purchaser and Seller shall attempt to mutually resolve any disagreements in
good faith regarding such draft Return. Any disagreements regarding the draft
Returns that are not resolved within an additional 10-day period by Seller and
Purchaser shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, whose decision
shall be final and whose fees shall be shared equally by Seller and Purchaser.
The Returns that are subject to any disagreement shall not be filed until such
disagreement is resolved; provided, that, if such Returns must be filed in
order to avoid a penalty, such Returns may be filed as prepared (with any
changes to which Seller and Purchaser agree prior to the date of filing
reflected therein), and, if further changes are agreed upon or required by the
Independent Accounting Firm, then Seller shall amend such Returns promptly to
reflect such changes. Purchaser shall cause the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries to cooperate fully and promptly in connection with Seller's
preparation of and the filing of all Returns under this Section 10.1(a).



(b)Except as provided in Section 10.1(a), Purchaser shall cause the Companies
and the Company Subsidiaries to prepare and file all Returns of the Companies
and the Company Subsidiaries due after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller for its review a draft of each Return of the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries to be filed after the Closing Date that may give rise
to any Tax liability of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries for which
Seller may be liable under this Agreement not fewer than 30 days before the
deadline for filing such Return, including extensions. Seller shall notify
Purchaser in writing if it objects to any portion of a draft Return within 15
days after the draft Return is delivered to Seller. If Purchaser does not
receive a written objection by the end of such 15-day period, Purchaser may
file the Return. If Seller notifies Purchaser that it objects to any portion
of the draft Return on or before the end of such 15-day period, Purchaser and
Seller shall attempt to mutually resolve any disagreements in good faith
regarding such draft Return. Any disagreements regarding the draft Returns
that are not resolved within an additional 10-day period by Seller and
Purchaser shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, whose decision
shall be final and whose fees shall be shared equally by Seller and Purchaser.
The Returns that are subject to any disagreement shall not be filed until such
disagreement is resolved; provided, that, if such Returns must be filed in
order to avoid a penalty, such Returns may be filed as prepared (with any
changes to which Seller and Purchaser agree prior to the date of filing
reflected therein), and, if further changes are agreed upon or required by the
Independent Accounting Firm, then Purchaser shall amend such Returns promptly
to reflect such changes.

10.2. Liability for Taxes. Seller and Willbros shall be responsible for and
indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees against all Taxes of the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and for Seller's portion
(as determined under Section 10.3) of all Taxes of the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries for any Tax period that begins before the Closing Date
and ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") to the extent such Taxes
(a) are not included as a current liability for purposes of computing the
Closing Net Working Capital or (b) are not otherwise satisfied by or on behalf
of Seller or any of its Affiliates. Purchaser shall be responsible for all
Taxes of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax
Period and for its portion (as determined under Section 10.3) of all Taxes of
the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period, except to
the extent Purchaser is indemnified against any such Tax pursuant to ARTICLE
IX hereof. 10.3. Apportionment of Taxes.



(a)With respect to any Straddle Period, the Taxes of the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries attributable to such Straddle Period shall be apportioned
between the portion of the Straddle Period that begins on the first day of the
Straddle Period and ends on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Straddle
Period"), which portion shall be the responsibility of Seller (to the extent
provided in Section 10.2), and all other Taxes attributable to the operations
or assets of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries for the Straddle
Period shall be the responsibility of Purchaser.

(b)In the case of income Taxes, sales and use Taxes, and Taxes based on gross
or net receipts or payments, the portion of the Tax allocated to the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period shall equal the amount that would be payable if the
Straddle Period ended on the last day of the Pre-Closing Straddle Period by
means of closing the books and records of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the last day of the Pre-Closing Straddle Period; provided,
that all permitted allowances, exemptions and deductions that are normally
computed on the basis of an entire year or period (such as depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be allocated
between the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the portion of the Straddle Period
that begins on the day immediately following the Closing Date and ends on the
last day of the Straddle Period (the "Post-Closing Straddle Period") in
proportion to the number of days in each such period.



(c)In the case of Taxes not described in Section 10.3(b), the portion of the
Tax allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall equal the amount of Tax
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days
during the Pre-Closing Straddle Period to the number of days during the entire
Straddle Period.

(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.3, any
deductions for income Tax purposes that are attributable to the payment of
bonuses, other compensation, the write off of capitalized financing fees and
any other deductions that arise on the Closing Date as a result of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, shall be taken into account in the
Pre-Closing Straddle Period.

(e)This Section 10.3 shall apply mutatis mutandis to any Tax refunds, Tax
credits or other Tax benefits to which any Company may be entitled.

10.4. Cooperation. In connection with the preparation of Returns, audit
examinations, and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the
Taxes imposed on the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, all Straddle Periods and all Post-Closing Tax Periods,
Purchaser, the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, including
furnishing or making available during normal business hours records, personnel
(as reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney and/or other
materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Returns, the
conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by Tax Authorities as
to the imposition of Taxes. Purchaser shall provide Seller, and Seller shall
provide Purchaser, with the information that each is respectively required to
report under section 6043A of the Code or any other applicable Tax rule. After
the Closing, Seller may deliver to Purchaser certain U.S. Tax information
requests in a similar manner provided to the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries in previous years in order to comply with Seller's U.S. Tax and
other reporting obligations and Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to
promptly complete such information requests as is required for Seller to
comply with Seller's U.S. Tax or other reporting obligations. 10.5. Tax Contests.



(a)If any Tax Authority issues to Purchaser, any of the Companies or Company
Subsidiaries (i) a notice of its intent to audit, examine or conduct a
proceeding with respect to Taxes or Returns of such Company or Company
Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii) a notice of deficiency,
notice of reassessment, proposed adjustment, assertion of claim or demand
concerning Taxes or Returns attributable to the operations or assets of any of
the Companies or Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (each, a
"Tax Claim"), Purchaser shall notify Seller of the receipt of such
communication from the Tax Authority and shall deliver a copy of any such
written communication to Seller within 10 Business Days after receiving such
Tax Claim, provided that failure to provide such notice shall not relieve
Seller of its indemnity obligations under ARTICLE IX and this ARTICLE X unless
Seller is actually prejudiced by such failure.

(b)Purchaser and such Company or Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall
control any proceeding relating to any Tax Claim with respect to Taxes
attributable to the operations or assets of or Returns of such Company or
Company Subsidiary (a "Tax Contest"); provided, that (i) Seller shall have the
right to participate in any such Tax Contest to the extent it relates to Taxes
or a Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and in such case Purchaser and such
Company or Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall promptly provide Seller
with copies of all written communications relating to the Tax Contest, (ii)
Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a timely basis regarding the progress
of any Tax Contest and consult with Seller with respect to any issue relating
to such Tax Contest that could affect Seller, and (iii) Purchaser and such
Company or Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall not settle or otherwise
resolve any Tax Contest (or any issue raised in any Tax Contest) if such
settlement or other resolution relates to Taxes for which Seller is liable
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c)At the request of Seller, Purchaser, any of the Companies or the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall settle any issue related to Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period on terms acceptable to Seller and the applicable Tax
Authority; provided, that (i) Seller shall pay when due all Taxes (and other
amounts) for which Seller is liable under this Agreement as a result of such
settlement, and (ii) the settlement would not result in Purchaser, any of the
Companies or Company Subsidiaries paying any increased Taxes for which Seller
is not required to fully indemnify Purchaser, the Companies or the Company
Subsidiaries under this Agreement.

10.6. Amended Returns. Purchaser shall not file or cause to be filed any
amended Returns covering any period or adjusting any Taxes for a period that
includes any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser
shall not take and shall not cause or permit the Companies or the Company
Subsidiaries to take any action that could increase the liability of Seller
for Taxes under this Agreement or otherwise without the prior written consent
of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

10.7. Tax Refunds. Purchaser, the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries shall
cooperate with Seller in obtaining any Tax refunds, Tax credits or any other
Tax benefits for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Any refunds, credits or other
benefits for Taxes of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods shall be the property of Seller, except to the extent
included as an asset for purposes of computing Closing Net Working Capital. If
Purchaser, any of the Companies or Company Subsidiaries receives a refund,
credit or other benefit for Taxes that is the property of Seller, Purchaser
shall pay the full amount of the refund, credit or other benefit to Seller
within 10 Business Days of the receipt thereof.

 10.8. Tax Elections; Post-Closing Actions. Neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall make an election or take any action after the Closing that
may have an impact on Seller or any of its Affiliates, including making an
election under section 338 of the Code with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Seller shall have no liability with respect to any Taxes
resulting by reason of any election made or deemed to be made by Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates after the Closing, whether express or implied, under
section 338 of the Code or with respect to any other Taxes or losses that are
caused as a result of any action or election by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing. When an action or election is required to be
taken or made by Purchaser or, after the Closing, by any of the Companies or
Company Subsidiaries in order to avoid Tax obligations being triggered, Seller
shall have no liability to the extent that any Taxes result by reason of
Purchaser, the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries failing to timely take
such action or make such election.



10.9. Other Taxes

Purchaser and Seller shall each be liable for and shall pay (and in the case
of Purchaser, shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from
and against all Damages relating to) one-half of all sales, use, stamp,
documentary, filing, recording, transfer or similar fees or Taxes or
governmental charges (together with any interest or penalty, addition to Tax
or additional amount imposed) as levied by any Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

10.10. Purchase Price Allocation



(a)The Aggregate Purchase Price will be allocated to and among Project
Services, Willbros Engineers, Government Services and EFS in proportion to
their relative fair market values. With respect to Project Services, Willbros
Engineers and Government Services (to the extent properly taken into account
under the Code, and including any other relevant items, including
Indebtedness), Aggregate Purchase Price allocated thereto shall be further
allocated among their respective assets in accordance with section 1060 of the
Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate). The allocation
among the Companies and further allocation among the assets of Project
Services, Willbros Engineers and Government Services (collectively, the
"Allocation") shall be delivered by Purchaser to Seller within 30 days after
the final determination of the Aggregate Purchase Price in accordance with
Section 3.3(b) for Seller's approval, which approval shall be delivered in
writing and not unreasonably withheld. Seller and Purchaser shall work in good
faith to resolve any disputes relating to the Allocation within 30 days of
Seller's receipt of the Allocation. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to
resolve any such dispute, such dispute shall be resolved promptly in writing
by the Independent Accounting Firm. Each of Purchaser and Seller agrees to
execute, if requested by the Independent Accounting Firm, an engagement letter
containing reasonable and customary terms. Each of Purchaser and Seller agrees
that there shall be no ex parte communications between either party, on the
one hand, and the Independent Accounting Firm, on the other hand, during the
Independent Accounting Firm's review and verification of the Allocation.
Purchaser and Seller shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred
under this Section 10.10. The costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be borne one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller.



(b)Purchaser and Seller shall file all Returns (including, but not limited to,
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent with the Allocation. Neither
Purchaser nor Seller shall take any Tax position inconsistent with such
Allocation and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall agree to any proposed
adjustment to the Allocation by any Tax Authority without first giving the
other party prior written notice; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall prevent Purchaser or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency
or adjustment by any Tax Authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation, and neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax
Authority challenging such Allocation.

10.11. Survival. The provisions of this ARTICLE X shall survive until 60 days
following the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation (including
extensions) for the matters referred to herein.





ARTICLE XI.

has materially breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, Purchaser has notified Seller of the breach and
the breach has continued uncured for a period of 30 days after the notice of

Agreement in accordance with Section 6.5 to disclose matters occurring after
the date hereof constituting a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before December 31, 2015 (the

case, unless the failure or impossibility results primarily from Purchaser
breaching any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement); or



(c)by Seller by giving written notice to Purchaser at any time (i) if
Purchaser has materially breached any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, Seller has notified Purchaser of the

case, unless the failure or impossibility results primarily from Seller
breaching any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement).



11.2. Effect of Termination. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.1 shall terminate all obligations of the parties hereunder, without

12.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, both written and oral, among the
parties hereto with respect thereto. Neither the duties nor obligations of
either party hereto, nor the rights of either party hereto, shall be expanded
beyond the terms of this Agreement on the basis of any legal or equitable
principle or on any other basis whatsoever. Neither any legal or equitable
principle nor any implied obligation of good faith or fair dealing nor any
other matter requires either party hereto to incur, suffer or perform any act,
condition or obligation contrary to the terms of this Agreement, whether or
not existing and whether foreseeable or unforeseeable. Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges that it would be unfair, and that it does not intend, to
increase any of the obligations of the other party under this Agreement on the
basis of any implied obligation or otherwise.

12.3. Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in
the case of an amendment, by Seller and Purchaser, or in the case of a waiver,
by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective, provided that no
amendment of or waiver in respect to Sections 9.4(i), 12.5, 12.9, or this
Section 12.3 shall be effective without the consent of Citizens Bank, N.A. (or any successor Financing Source
under any alternative financing). No failure or delay by either party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

12.4. Benefits; Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Except as set forth below, neither this
Agreement nor the obligations of either party hereunder shall be assignable or
transferable by such party without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto; provided that following the Closing, Purchaser may assign its
rights hereunder to any successor to the business unit of which the Companies
or Company Subsidiaries are a part.



12.5. No Third Party Beneficiary. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, Purchaser
Indemnitees, the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries, Seller, Seller
Indemnitees and their respective successors, heirs, personal representatives
and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement; provided that the Financing Sources shall be intended third parties
beneficiaries of Sections 9.4(i), 12.3, 12.9, and this Section 12.5, and shall
be entitled to enforce such provisions directly (and no amendment or
modification to such provisions in respect to the Financing Sources may be
made without the prior consent of the Financing Sources).



12.6. Severability. It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the
provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the Laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which
enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this
Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to
such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision
could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so
narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

12.7. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, the parties shall bear their own respective expenses (including
all compensation and expenses of their own counsel, financial advisors,
consultants, actuaries and accountants) incurred in connection with the
preparation, execution and consummation of this Agreement and of the
transactions contemplated hereby, provided, however, that Purchaser shall be
responsible for all filing and other similar fees payable in connection with
any filings or submissions under the HSR Act.



12.8. Counterparts and Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by the several parties hereto in separate counterparts,
and delivered by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission, each of
which shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument and an original
document.



12.9. Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICTING PROVISION OR RULE
(WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE
THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO BE APPLIED. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, THE INTERNAL
LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WILL CONTROL THE INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION
OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF UNDER SUCH JURISDICTION'S CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT
OF LAW ANALYSIS, THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW OF SOME OTHER JURISDICTION WOULD
ORDINARILY APPLY. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT SUCH PARTY MAY LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO,
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREUNDER.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto hereby agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Financing Agreements, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including, without limitation, any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and the appellate courts thereof), and that the provisions
immediately below relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.



12.10. Disclosure Schedules. To the extent that a disclosure made by Seller in
any Section of this Agreement or any of the Schedules (or subparts thereof)
reasonably informs Purchaser of information with respect to another Section of
this Agreement or any other Schedule (or subparts thereof) in order to avoid a
misrepresentation thereunder, such disclosure shall be deemed, for all
purposes of this Agreement, to have been made with respect to all such other
Sections of this Agreement and all such other Schedules (or subparts thereof),
notwithstanding any cross-references (which are included solely as a matter of
convenience) or lack of a Schedule reference in any representation or
warranty. Information reflected in the Schedules is not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Schedules. Such
additional information is set forth for informational purposes and does not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Disclosure of such
additional information shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment
that such information is required to be disclosed and disclosure of such
information shall not be deemed to enlarge or enhance any of the
representations or warranties in this Agreement or otherwise alter in any way
the terms of this Agreement. Inclusion of information in the Schedules shall
not be construed as an admission that such information is material to the
business, assets, liabilities, financial position, operations or results of
operations of the Companies and/or the Company Subsidiaries.
