 (b) _Cancellation of Stratex Excluded Shares_. Each Stratex Excluded Share issued or outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist without payment of any consideration therefor (except to the extent that such cancellation of any Stratex Excluded Shares held by Newco, Stratex or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries would result in U.S. federal income tax to Newco, Stratex or any of such Subsidiaries, in which case such Stratex Excluded Shares shall not be considered "Stratex Excluded Shares" for any purpose under this Agreement).

In addition, from time to time after the Effective 

   ##### 

  

  

Time, Newco will deposit with the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions with respect to the Class A Merger Shares to be paid or issued
pursuant to the last sentence of  _Section 6.2(c)_ upon due surrender of the

representing Class A Merger Shares, together with the amount of cash payable

other distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(a)_, are referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions acceptable to Harris) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the same number of Class A Merger Shares and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 6.2(i)_ and any dividends or other distributions to be paid or issued pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 6.2(c)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent with a duly executed copy of such letter of transmittal and compliance with all such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more certificates representing the number of Class A Merger Shares equal to one-fourth of the number of shares of Stratex Common Stock represented by such Certificate (rounded down to the next full number of such shares), (B) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in _Section 6.2(g)_ ) of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 6.2(i)_  _plus_ any cash dividends and distributions such holder is entitled to receive upon such surrender pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_, and (C) any non-cash dividends or distributions such holder is entitled to receive upon such surrender, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. If the issuance of a certificate representing Class A Merger Shares or any dividends or distributions is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent to such payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate have been paid or are not required to be paid.

No such dividends or other distributions in respect of the Class A Merger Shares shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _ARTICLE VI_. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid and/or issued to the holder of the Class A Merger Shares issued in 

   ##### 

  

    

exchange therefor, in each case without interest, (A) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date prior to the date of such surrender with
respect to such Class A Merger Shares and (B) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Class A
Merger Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
or delivery date subsequent to surrender. 

  

 (ii) At any meeting of Newcos stockholders after the Effective Time, holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to vote the number of shares of Class A Merger Shares represented by such Certificates, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates. 

  

 (d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Stratex of the shares of Stratex Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof and certificates for any Class A Merger Shares) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Stratex for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Newco. Any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this  _ARTICLE VI_ shall thereafter look only to Newco for delivery of the Merger Consideration and payments of dividends and distributions pursuant to this _ARTICLE VI_ upon due surrender of their Certificates in each case without any interest thereon.

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Newco, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Newco. 

  

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Newco shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable or deliverable pursuant to this _ARTICLE VI_ to any holder of Certificates such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Newco, as the case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of shares of Stratex Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 (h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person (who is the record holder of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Newco, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Newco as indemnity against any claim that may be 

   ##### 

  

    

made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, a certificate representing the Class A Merger
Shares and any dividends or other distributions that would be payable or
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered. 

  

 (i) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional share of Class A Common Stock will be issued and any holder of Stratex Common Stock that would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Class A Common Stock in the absence of this _Section 6.2(i)_ shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and shall represent such holders proportionate interest in a share of Class A Common Stock assuming the price of such a share was equal to four (4) _times_ the average of the closing prices per share of Stratex Common Stock on NASDAQ for the five (5) trading days ending on the last trading day prior to the Closing Date.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Stratex Common Stock (a " _Stratex Option_ ") under the Stratex Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted into an option to acquire that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to one-fourth of the number of shares of Stratex Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Stratex Option immediately prior to such conversion at an exercise price per share equal to four (4) _times_ the exercise price per share of Stratex Common Stock immediately prior to such conversion; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of Class A Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Stratex Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any Stratex Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of Class A Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Stratex Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Stratex Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) _Stratex Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive shares of Stratex Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of shares of Stratex Common Stock and each award of any kind consisting of shares of Stratex Common Stock that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Stratex Stock Plans and any other Stratex Benefits Plan, in each case other than Stratex Options (each, a " _Stratex Award_ "), shall be converted into the right to acquire, or the right to receive benefits measured by the value of, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal 

   ##### 

  

    

to one-fourth of the number of shares of Stratex Common Stock underlying such
Stratex Award (rounded down to the nearest whole number) immediately prior to
such conversion, and if such Stratex Award determines such rights by
reference to the extent the value of the shares of Stratex Common Stock
exceed a specified reference price, at a reference price per share of Class A
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to four (4) _times_
the reference price per share of Stratex Common Stock. Except as specifically
provided above, following the Effective Time, each Stratex Award shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
the rights under the relevant Stratex Stock Plan or other Stratex Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _Registration_. If, in connection with the satisfaction of the obligations set forth in _Section 6.4(a)_ and _Section 6.4(b)_, registration of any interests in the Stratex Stock Plans or other Stratex Benefit Plans or the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_ or _Section 6.4(b)_ is required under the Securities Act, Newco shall file with the SEC as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such interests or Class A Common Stock, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as the Stratex Stock Plans or other Stratex Benefit Plans, as applicable, remain in effect and such registration of interests therein or the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to be required. As soon as practicable after the registration of such interests or shares, as applicable, Newco shall deliver to the holders of Stratex Options and Stratex Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Stratex Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of such Stratex Options and Stratex Awards, and stating that such Stratex Options and Stratex Awards and agreements have been assumed by Newco and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this _Section 6.4(c)_ after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the Stratex Stock Plans). 

  

 (d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, (i) Stratex, the Stratex Board and the compensation committee of the Stratex Board, as applicable, shall adopt all resolutions and take all actions which are necessary to implement the provisions of _Section 6.4(a)_ and _Section 6.4(b)_ and (ii) Newco shall take all actions which are necessary to assume and perform the Stratex Options and Stratex Awards converted pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_ and _Section 6.4(b)_ including the reservation, issuance (subject to _Section 6.4(c)_ ) and listing of Class A Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 6.4_. Stratex shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Newco nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Stratex Common Stock or other capital stock of Stratex to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Stratex Options or Stratex Awards. 

  

 6.5. _Treatment of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 21, 2004 (the " _Warrant Agreement_ "), between Stratex and those Persons identified on _Schedule I_ to the Warrant Agreement, each Warrant shall automatically become exercisable for that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to one-fourth of the number of shares of Stratex Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time at an exercise price per share of Class A Common Stock equal to four (4) _times_ the exercise price 

   ##### 

  

    

of such Warrant per share of Stratex Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Concurrently with the Effective Time, Newco shall assume the
obligation to deliver shares of Class A Common Stock to those Persons who are
the record holders of the Warrants by entering into the Warrant Assumption

ARTICLE VII 

   

 _Representations and Warranties_  

   

 7.1. _Representations and Warranties of Stratex_. Except as set forth in the disclosure letter (subject to _Section 13.11(c))_ delivered to Harris by Stratex prior to entering into this Agreement and identified as such (the " _Stratex Disclosure Letter_ "), Stratex hereby represents and warrants to Harris that: 

  

 (a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Stratex and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization (to the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States) and has all requisite corporate or other legal entity power and authority to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where such ownership, operation or conduct requires such qualification (to the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except for any such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing or to have such power or authority that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Stratex Material Adverse Effect. Stratex has made available to Harris a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other comparable governing instruments) of Stratex and each of its Subsidiaries, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or other comparable governing instruments) so delivered is in full force and effect. Stratex is in compliance with the terms of its certificate of incorporation as amended through the date of this Agreement (the " _Stratex Certificate_ ") and its bylaws as amended through the date of this Agreement (the " _Stratex Bylaws_ " and, collectively with the Stratex Certificate, the " _Stratex Governing Instruments_ "). 

  

 (b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of Stratex consists solely of 150,000,000 shares of Stratex Common Stock, of which 97,690,241 shares were issued and outstanding as of the close of business on September 1, 2006, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock of Stratex, par value $0.01 per share (" _Stratex Preferred Stock_ "), of which no shares were issued or outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. Since September 1, 2006, Stratex has not issued any shares of Stratex Common Stock. All of the outstanding shares of Stratex Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. Stratex has no shares of Stratex Common Stock or Stratex Preferred Stock reserved for issuance other 

   ##### 

  

    

than (i) 15,530,000 shares of Stratex Common Stock reserved for issuance
pursuant to those plans of Stratex identified in _Section 7.1(b) of the
Stratex Disclosure Letter_ (the " _Stratex Stock Plans_ "), (ii) 200,000
shares of Stratex Preferred Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of November 3, 1998 (the "
_Rights Agreement_ ") between Stratex and Mellon Shareholder Services, LLC
(formerly ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, LLC), and (iii) 2,581,780 shares
of Stratex Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of warrants
for shares of Stratex Common Stock with an exercise price of $2.95 per share.
The Rights Agreement has expired and no longer has any legal force or effect,
and Stratex has not entered into or adopted or implemented any other
shareholder rights or similar plan. _Section 7.1(b) of the Stratex
Disclosure Letter_ contains a correct and complete list of each outstanding
option, restricted stock grant or other right under the Stratex Stock Plans,
including the holder, date of grant, term, number of shares of Stratex Common
Stock and, where applicable, exercise price and vesting schedule, as well as
whether the vesting will be accelerated by the execution of this Agreement or
consummation of the Transactions or by termination of employment or change of
position following consummation of the Merger. Each of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of, or other equity interest in, each of Stratexs
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and is owned by Stratex or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Stratex, free and clear of any Encumbrance. Except as described above in this
_Section 7.1(b)_, there are no preemptive or other options, warrants,
rights, conversion rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom"
stock rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, calls, stock-based performance units, commitments, Contracts,
agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which Stratex or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound (i)
obligating Stratex or any such Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause
to be issued, delivered or sold, shares of capital stock or other equity
interests in, or any security convertible into, or exercisable or
exchangeable for, any capital stock of or other equity interest in, Stratex or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Voting Debt, (ii) obligating Stratex or any
such Subsidiary to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option,
warrant, call, right, security, commitment, Contract, arrangement or
undertaking or (iii) that give any Person the right to receive any economic
benefit or right similar to or derived from the economic benefits and rights
occurring to holders of shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, or any security convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, any
capital stock of, or other equity interest in, Stratex or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Voting Debt, and no such obligations, instruments or
securities are authorized, issued or outstanding. There are no voting trusts
or other arrangements or understandings to which Stratex or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting, the dividend rights
or disposition of any capital stock of, or other equity interest in, Stratex
or any of its Subsidiaries. Stratex does not have outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right
to vote) with the stockholders of Stratex on any matter (" _Voting Debt_
"). Each Stratex Option (i) was granted in compliance with all applicable
Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the Stratex Stock Plan pursuant
to which it was issued, (ii) has an exercise price per share of Stratex
Common Stock equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share
of Stratex Common Stock on the date of such grant, (iii) has a grant date
identical to the date on which the Stratex Board or its compensation
committee actually awarded such Stratex Option and (iv) qualifies for the tax
and accounting treatment afforded to such Stratex 

   ##### 

  

    

Option in Stratexs tax returns and the financial statements included in the
Stratex Reports, respectively. Stratex does not own, directly or indirectly,
any voting interest that may require a filing by Newco, Harris or any of
their Subsidiaries under the HSR Act. Exhibit 21.1 to Stratexs Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, sets forth all of the
Subsidiaries of Stratex as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_. (i) Stratex has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions to which it is a party (collectively, the " _Stratex Transactions_ "), in each case subject only to adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Stratex Common Stock (the " _Stratex Requisite Vote_ "). This Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of Stratex enforceable against Stratex in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ "). 

  

 (ii) At a meeting duly called and held prior to execution of this Agreement, the Stratex Board unanimously adopted resolutions (A) approving, adopting and declaring advisable this Agreement and the Transactions and determining that the terms of the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, Stratex and the holders of Stratex Common Stock (collectively, the " _Board Approval_ ") and (B) recommending that the holders of Stratex Common Stock vote to adopt this Agreement (the " _Board Recommendation_ "). Such resolutions are sufficient to cause Section 203 of the DGCL not to apply to any of Harris, Newco or Merger Sub with respect to any of the Transactions or any other transaction following the Closing. 

  

 (iii) The Stratex Board has received the written opinion of its financial advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc. (" _Bear Stearns_ "), dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, on the basis of and subject to the matters set forth therein and assuming the simultaneous consummation of the Contribution Transaction, as of such date the exchange of one share of Class A Common Stock for four (4) outstanding shares of Stratex Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Stratex Common Stock. A signed copy of such opinion has been delivered to Harris. 

  

 (d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Consents; and Approvals_. 

  

 (i) Other than the filings or notices (A) pursuant to _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.3_ and _Section 3.4_, (B) required under the HSR Act or (C) required to be made under the Exchange Act or with NASDAQ, no Governmental Authorizations are required to be obtained or made by Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Stratex or the consummation by Stratex of the Stratex Transactions. 

  

 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance by Stratex of this Agreement do not, and the consummation by Stratex of the Stratex Transactions do not and will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Stratex Governing Documents or the comparable governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, a 

   ##### 

  

    

termination (or right of termination) or a default under or the acceleration
of any obligations or the creation of any Encumbrance on the assets of
Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or
both) pursuant to, any Contract binding upon Stratex or any of
its Subsidiaries or, assuming that the necessary consents, approvals and
filings referred to in clauses (A) through (C) of _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ are
duly obtained and/or made, any Laws, Governmental Authorizations or non
governmental permit or license to which Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under
any such Contracts, Governmental Authorizations, permits or licenses, except,
in the case of the foregoing clauses (B) or (C) only, for any breach,
violation, termination, default, acceleration, change or creation that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Stratex Material Adverse Effect. _Section 7.1(d) of the Stratex
Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a correct and complete list of Stratex Material
Contracts pursuant to which consents or waivers are or may be required prior
to consummation of the Transactions (whether or not subject to the exception
set forth with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above). 

  

 (iii) Without limiting the generality of clause (ii) above, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by Stratex nor the consummation by Stratex of the Stratex Transactions will require the receipt of any consent pursuant to, or give rise to any right of termination under, any of the Stratex Material Contracts except for any such consents and any such termination rights which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Stratex Material Adverse Effect if not obtained (in the case of such consents) or if exercised (in the case of such termination rights). 

  

 (iv) _Section 7.1(d) of the Stratex Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a correct and complete list of all material claims held by Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries, as creditors or claimants, with respect to debtors or debtors-in-possession subject to proceedings under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the " _Bankruptcy Code_ "), together with a correct and complete list of all orders entered by the applicable United States Bankruptcy Court with respect to each such proceeding. None of such orders, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Stratex Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (e) _Stratex Reports; Financial Statements_. (i) Stratex has made available to Harris each registration statement, report, form, proxy or information statement or other document filed or furnished by Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries with or to the SEC since March 31, 2006 (the " _Stratex Audit Date_ "), including Stratexs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2006, each in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively with each other, any such registration statements, reports, forms, proxy or information statements or other documents so filed or furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement and any amendments to any of the foregoing, the " _Stratex Reports_ "). Stratex and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished, as applicable, with or to the SEC all registration statements, reports, forms, proxy or information statements and other documents required to be so filed or furnished by them pursuant to applicable securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules since the Stratex Audit Date. Each of the Stratex Reports, at the time first filed with or furnished to the SEC, complied or will comply (as applicable) in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and complied in all material respects with the then 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable accounting standards. As of their respective dates, the Stratex
Reports did not, and any Stratex Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the
date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading. The Stratex Reports included or will
include all certificates required to be included therein pursuant to Sections
302 and 906 of the SOX Act, and the internal control report and attestation
of Stratexs outside auditors required by Section 404 of the SOX Act. 

  

 (ii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Stratex Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents or, in the case of Stratex Reports filed or furnished after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stratex and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Stratex Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents or, in the case of Stratex Reports filed or furnished after the date hereof, will fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated results of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows, respectively, of Stratex and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein. 

  

 (iii) Stratex is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the SOX Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ. 

  

 (iv) The management of Stratex has (A) designed and implemented disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) which management reasonably believes will ensure that material information relating to Stratex, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Stratex by others within those entities and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to Stratexs outside auditors and the audit committee of the Stratex Board (1) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Stratexs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Stratexs internal controls over financial reporting. Stratex has made available to Harris a summary of any such disclosure made by management since March 31, 2004. Since the Stratex Audit Date, any material change in internal controls over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any Stratex Report has been so disclosed. 

  

 (v) Since the date of their last certification filed with the SEC, neither the chief executive officer nor the chief financial officer of Stratex has become aware of any fact, circumstance or change that is or is reasonably likely to result in a "significant deficiency" or a 

   ##### 

  

    

"material weakness" in Stratexs internal controls over financial reporting,
other than as disclosed in the Stratex Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement. 

  

 (vi) Since March 31, 2003, (A) neither Stratex nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Stratex, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices and (B) no attorney representing Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of the securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Stratex or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Stratex Board or any committee thereof or, to the Knowledge of any officer of Stratex, to any director or officer of Stratex. 

  

 (vii) Since March 31, 2004, each registration statement of Stratex (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments or supplements thereto) filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not misleading. 

  

 (f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Stratex for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the registration statement on Form S-4 of Newco (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Registration Statement_ "), pursuant to which the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger will be registered with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act, or the proxy statement/prospectus (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") included in the Registration Statement which is to be sent to the stockholders of Stratex in connection with the Stratex Stockholder Meeting shall (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, at the time it is filed with the SEC or at the time it is declared effective by the SEC, or becomes effective, or (ii) in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time it is mailed to the stockholders of Stratex or at the time of the Stratex Stockholder Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus only, in light of the circumstances under which they are made). 

  

 (g) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the Stratex Audit Date, Stratex and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of such businesses. Since the Stratex Audit Date and on or prior to the date of this Agreement, there has not been any event, occurrence, discovery or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Stratex Material Adverse Effect. On or after the Stratex Audit Date and on or prior to the date of this Agreement, none of the actions or events described in clauses (a) through (w) of _Section 8.1_ has been taken or has occurred. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) _Litigation and Liabilities_. (i) There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, demands, claims, hearings, litigations, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Stratex, threatened against Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates by, before or with any Government Entity or any other Person. None of Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates is a party to, or subject to the provisions of, any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Government Entity. 

  

 (ii) There are no liabilities or obligations of Stratex or any Subsidiary of Stratex, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be disclosed, or any other facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any obligations or liabilities of, Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries, other than those: 

   

 (A) reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of Stratex or readily apparent in the notes thereto, in each case included in Stratexs annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended March 31, 2006 (but only to the extent so reflected or readily apparent); 

   

 (B) incurred in the ordinary course of business since March 31, 2006; 

   

 (C) required to be performed after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Contracts listed in _Section 7.1(d) of the Stratex Disclosure Letter_ or applicable Law; or 

   

 (D) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had since the Stratex Audit Date, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Stratex Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (i) _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements covering current or former employees of Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries and current or former directors of Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, and any deferred compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive, bonus, workers compensation, short term disability, vacation and severance plans and all employment, severance and change in control agreements, and all amendments thereto (the " _Stratex Benefit Plans_ ") are listed in _Section 7.1(i)(i) of the Stratex Disclosure Letter_, and each Stratex Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, including any master or prototype plan, has been separately identified. True and complete copies of all Stratex Benefit Plans listed in _Section 7.1(i)(i) of the Stratex Disclosure Letter_, including any trust instruments, insurance contracts and, with respect to any employee stock ownership plan, loan agreements forming a part of any Stratex Benefit Plans, and all amendments thereto have been provided or made available to Harris. 

  

 (ii) No Stratex Benefit Plan is a "multi-employer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multi-Employer Plan_ "). All Stratex Benefit Plans are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. Each Stratex Benefit Plan which 

   ##### 

  

    

is subject to ERISA (the " _Stratex ERISA Plans_ ") that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "
_Stratex Pension Plan_ ") and that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") for all Tax Law changes prior to the
Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to
the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable
remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and Stratex is
not aware of any circumstances likely to result in the loss of
the qualification of such Stratex Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the
Code. Any voluntary employees beneficiary association within the meaning of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code which provides benefits under a Stratex Benefit
Plan has (A) received an opinion letter from the IRS recognizing its exempt
status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and (B) filed a timely notice with
the IRS pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code, and Stratex is not aware of
circumstances likely to result in the loss of such exempt status under
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. Neither Stratex nor any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Stratex ERISA Plan that,
assuming the Taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date of
this Agreement, would subject Stratex or any Subsidiary to a Tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an
amount that would be material. Neither Stratex nor any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a Tax or penalty imposed
by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any Liability under
Section 4071 of ERISA. 

  

 (iii) No Liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer with Stratex under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (a " _Stratex ERISA Affiliate_ "). No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30 day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Stratex Pension Plan or by any Stratex ERISA Affiliate within the 12 month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No notices have been required to be sent to participants and beneficiaries or the PBGC under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. 

  

 (iv) All contributions required to be made under each Stratex Benefit Plan, as of the date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each Stratex Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Stratex Reports prior to the date hereof. Neither any Stratex Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of a Stratex ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and neither Stratex nor any Stratex ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. It is not reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any Stratex Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased by application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither Stratex nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is 

   ##### 

  

    

required to provide, security to any Stratex Pension Plan or to any single-
employer plan of a Stratex ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of
the Code. 

  

 (v) Under each Stratex Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Stratex Pension Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Stratex Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial condition of such Stratex Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year. 

  

 (vi) Neither Stratex nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Stratex Benefit Plan or collective bargaining agreement.

which they are made). 

  

 (g) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since June 30, 2006, Harris and its Subsidiaries have conducted the MCD Business only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of business. Since June 30, 2006 and on or prior to the date of this Agreement, there has not been any event, occurrence, discovery or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a Harris Material Adverse Effect.

None of Harris or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates is a party to, or subject to the provisions of, any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any Government Entity relating to the Contributed Assets, the MCD Business or the Transactions. 

  

 (ii) There are no liabilities or obligations of Harris or any Subsidiary of Harris relating to the Contributed Assets, the MCD Business or the Transactions, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be disclosed, or any other facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any obligations or liabilities of, Harris or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Contributed Assets, the MCD Business or the Transactions, other than those:

 (i) _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements covering the MCD Employees, including any "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 3(3) of ERISA, any deferred compensation, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive, bonus, workers
compensation, short term disability, vacation and severance plans and all
employment, severance and change in control agreements, and all amendments
thereto (the " _MCD Employee Benefit Plans_ "), are listed in  _Section
7.2(i)(i) of the Harris Disclosure Letter_, and each MCD Employee Benefit Plan
which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, including
any master or prototype plan, has been separately identified. True and
complete copies of all MCD Employee Benefit Plans listed in _Section
7.2(i)(i) of the Harris Disclosure Letter_, including any trust instruments
and insurance contracts and all amendments thereto, have been provided or
made available to Stratex. 

  

 (ii) No MCD Employee Benefit Plan is a Multi-Employer Plan. All MCD Employee Benefit Plans covering MCD Employees are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws, except to the extent failure to comply would not cause any Liability to Newco. Each MCD Employee Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (the " _MCD Employee ERISA Plans_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _MCD Employee Pension Plan_ ") and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS for all Tax Law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and Harris is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Any voluntary employees beneficiary association within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code which provides benefits under a MCD Employee Benefit Plan has (A) received an opinion letter from the IRS recognizing its exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and (B) filed a timely notice with the IRS pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code, and Harris is not aware of circumstances likely to result in the loss of its exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. Neither Harris nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any MCD Employee ERISA Plan that, assuming the Taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement, would subject Newco to a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount that would be material. 

  

 (iii) No Liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Harris or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, formerly maintained by any of them, or the terminated single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer with Harris under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (a " _Harris ERISA Affiliate_ "). 

  

 (iv) All contributions required to be made with respect to any MCD Employees under each MCD Employee Benefit Plan, as of the date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each MCD Employee Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the Audited Financial Statements. Neither Harris nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any Harris ERISA Affiliate maintains as of the date of this Agreement a single-employer plan within the meaning of 4001(a)(15) of ERISA or any plan subject to the requirements of Section 412 of the Code. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (v) Neither Harris nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any MCD Employee Benefit Plan. 

  

 (vi) There has been no amendment to, or announcement by Harris or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of the MCD Employees relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any MCD Employee Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such MCD Employee Benefit Plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will (A) entitle any MCD Employees to severance pay or benefits or any increase in severance pay or benefits upon any termination of employment after the date hereof or (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the MCD Employee Benefit Plans to any MCD Employees. None of Harris or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any contract, agreement or arrangement with any MCD Employee in connection with or in contemplation of any of the Transactions. 

  

 (vii) _Section 7.2(i)(vii) of the Harris Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all MCD Employees on September 1, 2006, identifying as to each a job title, years of service and location of employment. 

  

 (viii) There are no outstanding loans to any MCD Employee from any Contributed Subsidiary other than claims any MCD Employee may have under an MCD Employee Benefit Plan covering such MCD Employee. As of the date hereof, there is no pending, or to the Knowledge of Harris, threatened investigations or other proceedings by or with any Government Entity or litigation relating to the MCD Employee Benefit Plans. 

  

 (j) _Compliance with Laws and Regulations; Governmental Authorizations_. The MCD Business has not been, and is not being, conducted in material violation of any applicable Laws. To the Knowledge of Harris, no material change is required in the processes, properties or procedures Related to the MCD Business for them to continue to comply with such Laws, and Harris has not received any notice or communication of any material noncompliance with any such Laws that has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement. The MCD Business and the Contributed Assets have obtained, and are in substantial compliance with, all material Governmental Authorizations required or necessary for the conduct of the MCD Business as presently conducted, and neither Harris nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice from any Government Entity of any material noncompliance with any such Governmental Authorizations that has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement.

 (i) to the Knowledge of Harris, Harris and its Subsidiaries have materially complied at all times with all applicable Environmental Laws in conducting the MCD Business; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) to the Knowledge of Harris, no property currently owned, leased or operated by Harris or its Subsidiaries which is Related to the MCD Business (including soils, groundwater, surface water buildings or other structures) is contaminated with any Hazardous Substance in a manner that has given or could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Environmental Liability; 

  

 (iii) to the Knowledge of Harris, no property formerly owned, leased or operated by Harris or any of its Subsidiaries which is Related to the MCD Business was contaminated with any Hazardous Substance during or prior to such period of ownership, leasehold or operation in a manner that has given or could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Environmental Liability;

 (v) neither Harris nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice, demand, letter, claim or request for information alleging that Harris or any of its Subsidiaries may be in violation of or subject to liability under any Environmental Law as a result of the conduct of the MCD Business or any condition in, on, under or about the MCD Real Property; 

  

 (vi) neither Harris nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any order, decree, injunction or agreement with any Government Entity, or any indemnity or other agreement with any third party, concerning liability or obligations relating to any Environmental Law or otherwise relating to any Hazardous Substance, in each case relating to the conduct of the MCD Business or any condition in, on, under or about the MCD Real Property;

   ##### 

  

    

examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax

income Tax Returns (including all schedules and attachments thereto) filed by
or on behalf of the Contributed Subsidiaries for each of its fiscal years

 9.1. _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Stratex agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (any such Persons, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant, a " _Representative_ ") shall, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer with respect to (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, reorganization or other business combination transaction involving Stratex, (ii) any acquisition of any equity or other ownership interests in Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, 15% or more of the total voting power or economic interest of all of the outstanding equity or other ownership interest in Stratex or an economic interest of equivalent value in any Subsidiary of Stratex or (iii) any acquisition of assets of Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the total assets of Stratex and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (any such inquiry, proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "). Stratex further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives shall, directly or indirectly, provide any confidential or non public information or data to, or engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise encourage or facilitate any effort or attempt by any Person, in each case, other than Harris, Newco or Merger Sub, to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Stratex or the Stratex Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under Sections 14d-9 and 14e-2 of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or making any disclosures to holders of Stratex Common Stock that the Stratex Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the Stratex Board is required to make in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the holders of Stratex Common Stock under the DGCL (but if any disclosure made to effect such compliance has the substantive effect of withdrawing, or modifying or qualifying in any manner adverse to Harris, the Board Recommendation or Board Approval or recommending or approving another Acquisition Proposal (each, a " _Change In Recommendation_ "), Harris shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_) or (ii) at any time prior to, but not after, the Stratex Requisite Vote is obtained: (A) providing confidential or non public information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (assuming, for this purpose only, that all references to "15% or more" in the definition of such term were changed to "a majority") which did not result from a breach of this _Section 9.1_ (a " _Qualifying Acquisition Proposal_ "); (B) engaging or participating in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made a Qualifying Acquisition Proposal; or (C) approving or recommending to the holders of shares of Stratex Common Stock a Qualifying Acquisition Proposal (or agreeing to take any such action), if and only to the extent that, (1) in the case of any action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, after consulting with outside legal counsel the Stratex Board determines in good faith that failing to take such action would 

   ##### 

  

    

constitute a breach by the directors of Stratex of their fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; (2) prior to taking any action described in
clause (A) or (B) above, Stratex and the other Person referred to in such
clauses execute and deliver a written confidentiality agreement on
terms substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; (3) in the case of any action described in clause (B) or (C)
above, the Stratex Board determines in good faith and after consulting with
its financial advisors and outside counsel that the Qualifying
Acquisition Proposal referred to in such clauses is (x) more favorable from a
financial point of view to Stratexs stockholders than the Transactions after
taking into account any Revised Terms offered by Harris before such action is
taken and all other relevant factors (including but not limited to
the probability that such Qualifying Acquisition Proposal will be consummated
and the time required to effect such consummation) and (y) reasonably likely
to be consummated taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
(including, without limitation, any antitrust or competition approvals or non
objections) and other relevant factors (any such Qualifying Acquisition
Proposal, a " _Superior Proposal_ ") or, in the case of clause (A) or clause
(B) only, is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; (4) before
taking any of the actions described in clause (B) or (C) above, Stratex shall
have provided written notice to Harris of Stratexs or the Stratex
Boards intention to take such action, at least five (5) Business Days (in
the case of the first Qualifying Acquisition Proposal made by such Person) or
one (1) Business Day (in the case of any subsequent Qualifying Acquisition
Proposal made by such Person) shall have elapsed since the date on
which Harris received such notice and Stratex shall have complied with the
provisions of _Section 9.1(c)_. Any determination required or permitted to be
made by the Stratex Board after the date of this Agreement under this
Agreement shall be sufficient if approved by a majority of the total number
of members thereof at a meeting duly called and held and at which a quorum was
present and acting throughout. 

  

 (b) Stratex agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Stratex will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a transaction with Stratex to return or destroy all confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries and to destroy all summaries, analyses or extracts of or based upon such information in the possession of such Person or any of its Representatives. Stratex agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this  _Section 9.1_. None of Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries will waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party without the prior written consent of Harris. 

  

 (c) Stratex agrees that it will notify Harris as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 24 hours) if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal are received by, any information relating thereto is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations relating thereto are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer and thereafter shall keep Harris informed, on a current basis, as to the status and terms of any such proposal or offer and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. Stratex also agrees to 

   ##### 

  

    

provide any information to Harris that it is providing to another Person
pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ at the same time it provides it to such other
Person. Stratex agrees that during the five- and one-Business Day periods
described in subclause (4) of clause (ii) of the proviso in _Section 9.1_
 and in _Section 9.2_, Stratex shall negotiate in good faith with Harris
with respect to any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement proposed by Harris. Any such revisions which Harris offers
in writing to make which, if accepted by Stratex, would be legally binding on
the parties to this Agreement are referred to herein as " _Revised Terms_
". Stratex agrees that any material amendment to any Qualifying Acquisition
Proposal will be deemed to be a new Qualifying Acquisition Proposal for

No indemnification shall be available in respect of any settlement of any action or claim effected by an Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

EXHIBIT 1 

   

 _FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT_  

   

September 5, 2006 

   

[Name] 
 [Address] 

   

Dear Mr. : 

   

 This letter is to confirm our agreement regarding all of the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Common Stock_ "), of STRATEX NETWORKS, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Stratex_ "), beneficially owned (as defined below) by you and your Affiliates as of the date of this letter agreement (the " _Current Shares_ ") and all other shares of Common Stock as to which you or your Affiliates may hereafter acquire beneficial ownership after the date of this letter agreement (" _New Shares_ " and, collectively with the Current Shares, the " _Subject Shares_ "), which agreement was required to induce HARRIS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Harris_ "), to enter into the Formation, Contribution and Merger Agreement, dated the date hereof (the " _Formation Agreement_ "), among Stratex and Harris. As used in this letter agreement, " _beneficial ownership_ " shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing no shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options issued by Stratex shall be deemed to be beneficially owned for any purpose of this letter agreement unless, until and only to the extent that such shares are acquired upon any such exercise and nothing in this letter agreement shall be deemed to require any such exercise. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein which are defined in the Formation Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Formation Agreement; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing neither Stratex nor any of its other officers, directors or Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be your Affiliate. 

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, you hereby agree (i) to vote or cause to be voted all of the Subject Shares in favor of the adoption of the Formation Agreement and approval of the Merger at the Stratex Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), (ii) to vote or cause to be voted all of Subject Shares against any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or any other matters which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay or adversely affect the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Formation Agreement, (iii) to comply with all restrictions and obligations imposed on Stratexs Representatives by Section 9.1 of the Formation Agreement and (iv) not to sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or dispose of, or grant a proxy or enter into a voting agreement or trust or similar arrangement with respect to, any of the Subject Shares (other than pursuant to this letter agreement or to Harris or any of its Subsidiaries). In furtherance of your voting agreement in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence, you hereby revoke any and all previous proxies with respect to any of the Subject Shares and grant to Harris and such individuals or corporations as Harris may designate an irrevocable proxy to vote all of the Subject Shares beneficially owned by you or any of your Affiliates in 

   ##### 

  

    

accordance with such clause. You hereby acknowledge that the proxy granted by
the foregoing is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. In addition,
you hereby agree to execute such additional documents as Harris may
reasonably request to effectuate its proxy and voting rights under this
paragraph. You hereby agree to notify Stratexs transfer agent for the Common
Stock of the limitations on transfer imposed by this letter agreement. 

  

 You hereby represent and warrant that (i) you and/or your Affiliates are the sole record and beneficial owner of the Current Shares and will be the sole and record beneficial owner of all New Shares from and after the date you and/or your Affiliates acquire beneficial ownership thereof (with respect to each New Share, its " _Acquisition Date_ ") , (ii) you and your Affiliates have the sole and full right, power and authority to vote all of the Current Shares and will have the sole and full right, power and authority to vote all of the New Shares from and after their respective Acquisition Dates, (iii) you have full power and authority to, and will, cause each of your Affiliates who beneficially owns any Subject Shares to comply with this letter agreement, (iv) you have full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform your obligations under this letter agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) this letter agreement has been duly executed and delivered by you and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of you, enforceable against you in accordance with its terms subject only to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and (v) neither the execution, delivery or performance by you of this letter agreement nor the consummation by you or your Affiliates of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a violation of, or conflict with, or default under, any applicable Law or any contract, commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or restriction of any kind to which you or any of your Affiliates are a party or by which you or any such Affiliate or the Subject Shares are bound. 

  

 We each hereby agree that you are not making any agreement or understanding herein in any capacity other than in your capacity as a stockholder of Stratex. Nothing contained in this letter agreement shall restrict you from taking any actions as an officer or director of Stratex if the failure to take such action would result in a breach of your fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Stratex. 

  

 This letter agreement will terminate, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate, concurrently with consummation of the Merger or the termination of the Formation Agreement in accordance with its terms. No such termination shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this letter agreement. 

  

 Each party shall be entitled, without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to such party, to specific performance of all of the other partys obligations hereunder. This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof. No party shall be required to pay or reimburse any 

   ##### 

  

    

expenses incurred by any other party in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance of this letter agreement. 

  

 This letter agreement (i) is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person or entity other than the parties who are signatories hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, (ii) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (iii) may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original. No provision of this letter agreement may be amended or waived unless such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by all parties hereto or, in the case of a waiver, by the waiving party. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. 

  

 If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this letter agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this letter agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. 

  

 _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THIS LETTER AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this letter agreement and of the documents referred to in this letter agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this letter agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner 

   ##### 

  

    

provided in notice provisions of this letter agreement or in such other manner
as may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. 

  

 EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH AND THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.

Article III 
 Purpose 

   

 The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware. 

  

Article IV 
 Capitalization 

   

 The total number of shares of all classes that this Corporation is authorized to issue is [650,000,000] shares, of which (i) [50,000,000] shares shall be designated as preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ "), (ii) [400,000,000] shares shall be designated as Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Class A Common Stock_"), and (iii) [200,000,000] shares shall be designated as Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Class B Common Stock_" and, collectively with the Class A Common Stock, the " _Common Stock_ "). 

  

 Except for issuances expressly provided for in this Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation shall not issue any shares of Class B Common Stock or any securities or other rights convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Class B Common Stock without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding prior to such issuance (each such issuance requiring such prior approval is hereinafter referred to as an " _Additional Class B Issuance_"). 

  

 Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation, the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall have the same rights and privileges and shall rank equally, share ratably and be identical in all respects as to all matters. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (a) _Voting_. Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or required by law, the Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters presented to the stockholders, with each holder of Common Stock being entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on such matters; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing as long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding (i) the holders of the Class B Common Stock shall have the sole and exclusive right to elect or remove the Class B Directors (as defined below) and no holder of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation shall have any voting rights with respect to such matters and (ii) the Corporation shall not, without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B Common Stock voting separately as a class: (A) amend, alter or repeal (including by merger or otherwise) any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation so as to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or protections of the Class B Common Stock, (B) effect or agree to effect any Additional Class B Issuance or (C) take any other action upon which a separate class vote of the Class B Common Stock shall be required by law. 

   

 (b) _Dividends_. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends and distributions (whether payable in cash or otherwise) as may be declared on the Common Stock by the board of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor; _provided, howeve_ r, that the Board shall declare no dividend or distribution, and no dividend or distribution shall be paid, with respect to any outstanding share of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, whether in cash or otherwise (including any dividend in shares of Class A Common Stock on or with respect to shares of Class A Common Stock or any dividend in shares of Class B Common Stock on or with respect to shares of Class B Common Stock (collectively, " _Stock Dividends_ ")), unless the same dividend or distribution is simultaneously declared or paid, as applicable, with respect to each outstanding share of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. If a Stock Dividend is declared or paid with respect to one class of Common Stock, then a Stock Dividend shall likewise be declared or paid with respect to the other class of Common Stock and shall consist of the number of shares of such other class which bears the same relationship to the total number of shares of such other class outstanding immediately prior to the payment of such Stock Dividends as the number of shares to be issued in the Stock Dividend with respect to the first referenced class of Common Stock bears to the total number of shares of such first referenced class outstanding immediately prior to the payment of such Stock Dividends. Stock Dividends with respect to Class A Common Stock may be paid only with shares of Class A Common Stock. Stock Dividends with respect to Class B Common Stock may be paid only with shares of Class B Common Stock. 

   

 (c) _Subdivisions, Combinations and Mergers_. If the Corporation shall in any manner split, subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of either class of Common Stock, the outstanding shares of the other class of Common Stock shall likewise be split, subdivided or combined in the same manner proportionately and on the same basis per share. In the event of any merger, statutory share exchange, consolidation or similar form of corporate transaction involving the Corporation (whether or not the Corporation is the 

   ##### 

  

    

surviving entity), the holders of Class A Common Stock and the holders of
Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the same per share
consideration, if any. 

   

 (d) _Rights on Liquidation_. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation (whether voluntary or involuntary), the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders shall be distributed in equal amounts per share to the holders of Class A Common Stock and the holders of Class B Common Stock, as if such classes constituted a single class. For purposes of this paragraph, a merger, statutory share exchange, consolidation or similar corporate transaction involving the Corporation (whether or not the Corporation is the surviving entity), or the sale, transfer or lease by the Corporation of all or substantially all its assets, shall not constitute or be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation. 

   

 (e) _Exchange_. At any time or from time to time, any holder of Class B Common Stock may exchange (i) any outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock held by such holder for an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock or (ii) any outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock for an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock, in each case by surrendering the certificates, if any, for such shares together with written notice duly signed by such holder requesting such exchange and accompanied by all payments required for documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in connection with such exchange or evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation that all such taxes have been paid. To the extent permitted by law, such exchange shall be deemed to have been effected at the close of business on the date of such surrender. 

   

 (f) _Automatic Conversion_. Each outstanding share of Class B Common Stock shall convert into one outstanding share of Class A Common Stock automatically and without any further action by the Corporation or any other Person: (i) at the first time the holders of all of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (assuming that all the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class B Common Stock have been so exchanged) are collectively entitled to cast less than 10% of the Total Voting Power (as defined below) and (ii) if such Class B Common Stock is transferred by a holder to any Person who is not an Affiliate of such holder or a Nominee (as defined below) of such holder or one of its Affiliates; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing no such conversion shall occur pursuant to this clause (ii) if such transfer is part of a transfer by such holder and its Affiliates of all of the shares of Class B Common Stock then owned by them (either directly or through a Nominee) to any other Person or to any other Person and its Affiliates. From and after any such conversion, each certificate, if any, formerly representing shares of Class B Common Stock shall represent the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock and upon surrender of such certificate to the Corporation the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive a new certificate or book-entry interest representing such number of shares of Class A Common Stock. Immediately upon any such conversion of any shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock, the rights of the holders of such shares of Class B Common Stock as such shall cease and such holders 

   ##### 

  

    

shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record owners of the
shares of Class A Common Stock into which such shares of Class B Common Stock
were converted;  _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing such
holders shall be entitled to receive when paid any dividends or other
distributions declared on such shares of Class B Common Stock with a record
date preceding the time of such conversion and which have not yet been paid
as of the time of such conversion subject to the following sentence. Upon any
such conversion of any shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A
Common Stock, any dividend or other distribution declared on such shares of
Class B Common Stock with a record date or payment date after the time of
such conversion shall be deemed to have been declared, and shall be payable,
with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock into which such shares of
Class B Common Stock shall have been so converted and any such
dividend payable in shares of Class B Common Stock shall be deemed to have
been declared, and shall be payable, in shares of Class A Common Stock. 

   

 (g) _Reservation of Shares_. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, such number of shares of Class A Common Stock as would become issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class B Common Stock then outstanding. 

   

 (h) _Certain Definitions_. In this Certificate of Incorporation, any reference herein to any law, rule or regulation shall be deemed to be a reference to any successor or replacement law, rule or regulation and the following terms shall have the meanings assigned to them below:

outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the

Article V 
 Section 203 of the DGCL 

   

 The Corporation hereby elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL until the first time (the " _Section 203 Time_") on which the holders of all the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (assuming that all of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class B Common Stock are so exchanged) are collectively entitled to cast less than 15% of the Total Voting Power. At the Section 203 Time, Section 203 of the DGCL shall begin to apply prospectively to the Corporation, but no Person shall be deemed to be an "interested stockholder" (as such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) solely because such Person became an interested stockholder prior to the Section 203 Time. 

  

Article VI 
 Class B Directors 

   

 The number of Directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time pursuant to the bylaws of the Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "); _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the Bylaws to the contrary: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (a) At all times when the holders of all the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (assuming that all the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class B Common Stock have been so exchanged) are collectively entitled to cast a majority of the Total Voting Power: (i) the Board shall be comprised of nine Directors, (ii) the Class B Common Stock shall be entitled, voting separately as a class, to elect five of such Directors to serve as Class B Directors, (iii) the quorum for action by the Board shall be a majority of the Board, which majority shall include at least four Class B Directors, and (iv) the remaining four Directors will be Class A Directors nominated by a nominating committee consisting solely of the Class A Directors then in office (the " _Nominating Committee_ ") and elected by the holders of the Common Stock, voting together as a single class; _provided, however,_ that at all times when Rule 4350(d)(2)(A) of the NASDAQ Rules applies to the Corporation a sufficient number of the Class A Directors must satisfy the requirements of that Rule with respect to the Corporation so that, together with any Class B Directors which may also satisfy such requirements with respect to the Corporation, there are enough Directors to constitute an audit committee of the Board which complies with the requirements of Rule 4350(d) of the NASDAQ Rules. As used herein, " _NASDAQ Rules_ " means the rules promulgated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. which apply to issuers whose common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. 

   

 (b) At all times when the holders of all of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (assuming that all the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class B Common Stock have been so exchanged) are collectively entitled to cast a percentage of the Total Voting Power (the " _Voting Percentage_ ") which is less than a majority but equal to or greater than 10% of the Total Voting Power: (i) the Class B Common Stock shall be entitled, voting separately as a class, to elect a number of Class B Directors which represents the Voting Percentage of the total number of Directors then comprising the entire Board (rounded down to the next whole number of Directors), and (ii) the remaining Directors will be Class A Directors nominated by the Nominating Committee (the composition of which shall comply with the requirements of Rule 4350(c)(4) of the NASDAQ Rules) and elected by the holders of the Common Stock, voting together as a single class;  _provided, however,_ that at all times when such rules apply to the Corporation a sufficient number of the Class A Directors must (A) qualify as an Independent Director with respect to the Corporation as such term is defined in Rule 4200(15) of the NASDAQ Rules so that Board complies with Rule 4350(c)(1) of the NASD Rules and (B) satisfy the requirements of Rule 4350(d)(2)(A) of the NASDAQ Rules with respect to the Corporation so that, together with any Class B Directors which may also satisfy such requirements with respect to the Corporation, there are enough Directors to constitute an audit committee which complies with the requirements of Rule 4350(d) of the NASDAQ Rules. 

   

 (c) The holders of the Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class, shall have the sole right to remove the Class B Directors with or without cause at any time and for any reason and the sole right to appoint successor Directors to fill any vacancies on the Board caused by any such removals. The holders of the Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a class, shall have the sole right to remove the Class 

   ##### 

  

    

A Directors without cause and the sole right to appoint successor Directors to
fill any vacancies on the Board caused by any such removals. The holders of
the Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the sole
right to remove the Class A Directors for cause and the sole right to appoint
successor Directors to fill any vacancies on the Board caused by any such
removals. Any vacancy created by any resignation, death or incapacity of any
Class B Director shall be filled by the remaining Class B Directors then in
office or, if there are none, by the holders of the Class B Common Stock,
voting separately as a class. Any vacancy created by the resignation, death
or incapacity of any Class A Director shall be filled by the remaining Class
A Directors then in office or, if there are none, by the holders of the Class
A Common Stock, voting separately as a class. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, if any transaction or transactions occur which entitle the holders of Class B Common Stock to preemptive rights under Article VIII hereof, then no determination of the percentage of the Total Voting Power collectively entitled to be cast by the holders of all of the outstanding Class B Common Stock (assuming that all the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class B Common Stock have been so exchanged) shall be made for any purpose of this Certificate of Incorporation until after the exercise or expiration of all such preemptive rights in respect of all such transactions by such holders. 

  

Article VII 
 Corporate Opportunities 

   

 Nothing in this Article VII will impair the Corporations ability to enter into contractual arrangements with a stockholder of the Corporation which restrict the stockholder from engaging in activities otherwise allowed by this Article and the following provisions shall be subject to the terms of any such contractual arrangements. The provisions of this Article VII shall be effective to the maximum extent permitted by Law and are not intended to be enforceable to any further extent. 

  

 Except as expressly provided in the proviso to the last sentence of this Article VII, each holder of Class B Common Stock shall have the right to, and none of such holders shall have any fiduciary duty or other obligation to the Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any stockholder of any of the foregoing not to, take any of the following actions: 

   

 (a) engage in the same or similar activities or lines of business as the Corporation or any Subsidiary or develop or market any products or services that compete, directly or indirectly, with those of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; 

   

 (b) invest or own any interest in, or develop a business relationship with, any Person engaged in the same or similar activities or lines of business as, or otherwise in competition with, the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; 

   

 (c) do business with any client or customer of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) employ or otherwise engage any former officer or employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 No holder of Class B Common Stock nor any of its Affiliates nor any officer, director, employee or former employee of any such holder or Affiliate that is not currently an employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Class B Directors) shall have any obligation, or be liable, to the Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any stockholder of any of the foregoing for or arising out of the conduct described in the immediately preceding paragraph or the exercise of any rights under the Formation, Contribution and Merger Agreement, dated as of September 5, 2006, between Harris Corporation and Stratex Networks, Inc. or any other agreement attached thereto as an exhibit or contemplated thereby and none of them shall be deemed to have acted (i) in bad faith, (ii) in a manner inconsistent with the best interests of the Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their shareholders or (iii) in a manner inconsistent with, or opposed to, any fiduciary duty owed by them to the Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their stockholders by reason of any such conduct or exercise of such rights or any of their participation therein. 

  

 If any holder of Class B Common Stock, any Subsidiary of such holder or any director, officer or employee of such holder or any of such Subsidiaries, including any such individuals who are also directors, officers or employees of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (collectively, the " _Class B Entities_") acquires knowledge of a potential opportunity, transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both a Class B Entity, on the one hand, and the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, (each, a " _Corporate Opportunity_ "), then each Class B Entity shall have the right to, and none of them shall have any fiduciary duty or other obligation not to, pursue such Corporate Opportunity for itself or direct such Corporate Opportunity to any of its Affiliates or any third party and none of the Class B Entities (i) shall have any duty to communicate, offer or present such corporate opportunity to the Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any director, officer or employee of any of the foregoing, (ii) shall have any liability to the Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty as a stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, (iii) shall be deemed to have acted (x) in bad faith, (y) in a manner inconsistent with the best interests of the Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their stockholders or (z) in a manner inconsistent with, or opposed to, any fiduciary duty [or other duty] owed by them to the Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their stockholders, in each case by reason of the fact that any Class B Entity pursues or acquires such Corporate Opportunity for itself, directs such Corporate Opportunity to any of its Affiliates or any third party, or does not communicate information regarding such Corporate Opportunity to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, directors, officers or employees; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding anything in this Article VII to the contrary a Corporate Opportunity offered to an individual who is a director or officer of both the Corporation and the holder of Class B Common Stock shall belong to the Corporation if such Corporate Opportunity is expressly offered to such individual in writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation. 

  

 Neither the alteration, amendment or repeal of this Article VII nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VII nor the 

   ##### 

  

    

conversion or exchange of Class B Common Stock shall eliminate or reduce the
effect of this Article VII in respect of any Corporate Opportunity any Class
B Entity began pursuing, any matter occurring or any cause of action, suit or
claim that, absent this Article VII, would have accrued or arisen prior to
such alteration, amendment, repeal, adoption, conversion or exchange. 

  

Article VIII 
 Preemptive Rights 

   

 If the Corporation proposes to issue (a " _Proposed Issuance_ ") any capital stock of the Corporation or any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, such capital stock (collectively, the " _Offered Securities_ ") at any time when the holders of all the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (assuming that all the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class B Common Stock have been so exchanged) are collectively entitled to cast a majority of the Total Voting Power, the Corporation shall give written notice of the Proposed Issuance to the holders of Class B Common Stock (the " _Offer Notice_ ") at least 30 days prior to such issuance. Such notice shall describe all the material terms and conditions of such Proposed Issuance. Each holder of Class B Common Stock shall have the right to acquire at the same price and on the same terms and conditions, an additional amount of the Offered Securities so that the percentage of the outstanding Common Stock and Total Voting Power then owned by such holder shall not change as a result of such acquisition and Proposed Issuance; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing (i) such holder may elect to acquire a lesser number of additional Offered Securities as it may determine in its sole discretion and (ii) if the Offered Securities are, or are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, Class A Common Stock, then in lieu thereof such holder shall be entitled to purchase Class B Common Stock or Offered Securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Class B Common Stock, as applicable. If any holder of Class B Common Stock fails to accept such offer by written notice received by the Corporation within fifteen (15) days following the date on which such holder received the Offer Notice, the Proposed Issuance may be consummated free and clear of the preemptive right granted to the holders of Class B Common Stock under this Article VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the purchase price for any Proposed Issuance is to be paid in whole or in part other than in cash, then the holders of Class B Common Stock may pay the purchase price in cash in an amount per Offered Security equal to the fair market value of the aggregate non-cash consideration so payable, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board, divided by the total number of Offered Securities to be issued without giving effect to the preemptive right granted by this Article VIII. 

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the preemptive right granted by this Article VIII shall not apply to any Proposed Issuance pursuant to any stock option, restricted stock or employee benefit plan of the Corporation; _provided, however,_ at the end of each month the Corporation shall give the holders of Class B Common Stock written notice of all such Proposed Issuances during such month (the " _Monthly Offer Notice_ ") and each holder of Class B Common Stock shall have the right, exercisable by delivering written notice to the Corporation (each, a " _Monthly Exercise Notice_ ") within fifteen days after the date on which such holder received the Monthly Offer Notice, to purchase for cash a sufficient number of shares of Class B Common Stock so that the percentage of the outstanding Common Stock and Total Voting Power then owned by such holder shall not change as a result of such acquisition and Proposed Issuances; 

   ##### 

  

    

 _provided, however,_ that such holder may elect to acquire a lesser number of
such shares of Class B Common Stock as it may determine it its sole
discretion. The per share purchase price for any purchase of Class B Common
Stock pursuant to a Monthly Exercise Notice shall be (i) if the Class A
Common Stock is then listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an
automated inter-dealer quotation system, the closing price of the Class A
Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the
Corporation received the Monthly Exercise Notice or (ii) in all other cases,
the fair market value of one share of Class A Common Stock as determined in
good faith by the Board. 

  

Article IX 
 Limitation of Liability 

   

 A Director shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director, except to the extent that such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as currently in effect or as the same may hereafter be amended. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize corporate action further limiting or eliminating the liability of Directors to the Corporation or its stockholders, then without any further action by any Person such liability shall be so limited or eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended. No adoption, amendment, modification or repeal of this Article IX or any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation shall adversely affect any right or protection of a Director existing at the time of such adoption, amendment, modification or repeal with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such time. 

  

Article X 
 Bylaws 

   

 In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board is expressly authorized to adopt, repeal, alter, amend and rescind from time to time any or all of the Bylaws of the Corporation. 

  

Article XI 
 Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation 

   

 This Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred on stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

this to the meeting and such business not properly brought before the meeting

of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the
meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 14 and if it shall be so determined, the chairman shall so
declare this to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be
disregarded.

   

ARTICLE III 

   

DIRECTORS 

   

 Section 1\. Subject to any requirements in the certificate of incorporation, the number of directors that shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors but in no event shall be less than six (6). The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article, and each director elected shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders, but shall not be older than 75 years of age on the date of their election or appointment to be eligible to serve as a director unless otherwise specifically approved by resolution passed by the directors then in office or by the sole remaining director. 

  

 Section 2\. Except as otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having a right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, unless sooner removed. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors 

   ##### 

  

    

may be held in the manner provided by statute. If, at the time of filling any
vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office shall
constitute less than a majority of the whole Board of Directors (as
constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery
may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten
percent (10%) of the total voting power of all the outstanding capital stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of such directors, summarily order
an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created
directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in
office. 

  

 Section 3\. The business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the certificate of incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. 

  

 Section 4\. The Board of Directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.

 Section 6\. Each person who was or is made a party to or witness or other participant in or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (hereinafter a "designee"), whether the basis of the proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer or designee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer or designee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, penalties, amounts paid in settlement, liability and loss (including, without limitation, all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any of the foregoing) (hereinafter collectively "expenses", which expenses shall also include without limitation any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification or advancement under this Section 6 or Article VII, Section 7 or 8) reasonably incurred or suffered by such director, officer or designee in connection therewith;  _provided, however_ , that, except as provided in Article VII, Section 8, the corporation shall indemnify any such director, officer or designee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director, officer or designee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The corporation may, by 

   ##### 

  

    

action of the Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and
agents of the corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors, officers and designees. 

  

 Section 7\. Expenses incurred by or on behalf of any person in defending any proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or designee of the corporation shall be advanced by the corporation prior to the final disposition of such proceeding; _provided, however_ , that if the General Corporation Law of Delaware requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director, officer or designee in his or her capacity as a director, officer or designee (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director, officer or designee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director, officer or designee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director, officer or designee is not entitled to be indemnified under Article VII, Section 6 or this Section 7 or otherwise. 

  

 Section 8\.

It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of Delaware for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or the stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or the stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 

  

 Section 9\. Article VII, Sections 6 and 7 shall be deemed to be a contract between the corporation and each director who serves in such capacity at any time while this Bylaw is in effect, and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. 

  

 Section 10\. The foregoing rights of indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled 

   ##### 

  

    

under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in
another capacity while holding such office, to the extent such additional
rights to indemnification are authorized in the certificate of incorporation.
Persons seeking indemnification or advancement may seek either or both at his
or her discretion and the pursuit of one shall neither be deemed a waiver of
such persons rights to pursue the other, nor shall it have any effect on the
outcome of such persons pursuit of the other. Nothing contained in Article
VII, Section 6, 7, 8 or 9 or this Section 10 shall affect any right to
indemnification to which persons other than directors, officers or designees
may be entitled by contract or otherwise. Nothing in this section shall
restrict the power of the corporation to indemnify its directors, officers,
designees, employees or agents under any provision of the General Corporation
Law of Delaware, as amended from time to time, or under any other provision
of law from time to time applicable to the corporation, nor shall anything
in Article VII, Section 6, 7, 8 or 9 or this Section 10 authorize the
corporation to indemnify its directors, officers, designees, employees or
agents in situations prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware or
other applicable law.

 Section 1.6. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Board by the President, or in the absence of the President by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the absence of the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. 

   

 Section 1.7. _Voting; Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the 

   ##### 

  

    

Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be
by written ballot and need not be conducted by inspectors unless the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to
vote thereon present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting shall
so determine. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the
shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled
to vote on the election of directors. In all other matters, unless
otherwise provided by law or by the certificate of incorporation of the
Corporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the
stockholders. Where a separate vote by class or classes is required,
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of such class
or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be
the act of such class or classes, except as otherwise provided by law or by
the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws. 

   

 Section 1.8. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; _provided, however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 

  

 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has 

   ##### 

  

    

been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be
at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts
the resolution taking such prior action. 

  

 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 

   

 Section 1.9. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. 

   

 Section 1.10. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or by law, any action required by law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to (a) its registered office in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified mail or registered mail, return receipt requested, (b) its principal place of business, or (c) an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner required by this by-law to the Corporation, 

   ##### 

  

    

written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to (a) its registered office in the
State of Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, (b) its principal place of business, or (c) an officer or agent of
the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings
of stockholders are recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate
action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given
to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the
action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the
meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written
consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take the action
were delivered to the Corporation as provided in this Section 1.10. 

  

ARTICLE II

 Section 2.1. _Powers; Number; Qualifications_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise provided by law or in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation.

Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class or from any other cause may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director. 

   

 Section 2.3. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such times as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine, and if so determined notice thereof need not be given. 

   ##### 

  

   

 Section 2.4. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware whenever called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, by the President or by any two directors. Reasonable notice thereof shall be given by the person or persons calling the meeting. 

   

 Section 2.5. _Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone Permitted_. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case may be, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this by-law shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 

   

 Section 2.6. _Quorum; Vote Required for Action_. At all meetings of the Board of Directors one-third of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors unless the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws shall require a vote of a greater number. In case at any meeting of the Board of Directors a quorum shall not be present, the members of the Board of Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. 

   

 Section 2.7. _Organization_. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Board by the President, or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the absence of the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. 

   

 Section 2.8. _Action by Directors Without a Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation Corporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee. 

   

 Section 2.9. _Compensation of Directors_. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE III 

   

 _Committees_  

    

 Section 3.1. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors or in these Bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the following matters: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by law to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (ii) adopting, amending or repealing these Bylaws. 

   

 Section 3.2. _Committee Rules_. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides, each committee designated by the Board of Directors may adopt, amend and repeal rules for the conduct of its business. In the absence of a provision by the Board of Directors or a provision in the rules of such committee to the contrary, a majority of the entire authorized number of members of such committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, the vote of a majority of the members present at a meeting at the time of such vote if a quorum is then present shall be the act of such committee, and in other respects each committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board of Directors conducts its business pursuant to Article II of these Bylaws. 

  

ARTICLE IV 

   

 _Officers_  

    

 Section 4.1. _Officers; Election_. As soon as practicable after the annual meeting of stockholders in each year, the Board of Directors shall elect a President and a Secretary, and it may, if it so determines, elect from among its members a Chairman of the Board and a Vice Chairman of the Board. The Board of Directors may also elect one or more Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries, a Treasurer and one or more 

   ##### 

  

   

Assistant Treasurers and such other officers as the Board of Directors may
deem desirable or appropriate and may give any of them such further
designations or alternate titles as it considers desirable. Any number of
offices may be held by the same person unless the certificate of
incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws otherwise provide. 

   

 Section 4.2. _Term of Office; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies_. Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors electing any officer, each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Any officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board of Directors or to the President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein, and unless otherwise specified therein no acceptance of such resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The Board of Directors may remove any officer with or without cause at any time. Any such removal shall be without prejudice to the contractual rights of such officer, if any, with the Corporation, but the election of an officer shall not of itself create contractual rights. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by death, resignation, removal or otherwise may be filled by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting. 

   

 Section 4.3. _Powers and Duties_. The officers of the Corporation shall have such powers and duties in the management of the Corporation as shall be stated in these Bylaws or in a resolution of the Board of Directors which is not inconsistent with these Bylaws and, to the extent not so stated, as generally pertain to their respective offices, subject to the control of the Board of Directors. The Secretary shall have the duty to record the proceedings of the meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors and any committees in a book to be kept for that purpose. The Board of Directors may require any officer, agent or employee to give security for the faithful performance of his or her duties. 

  

ARTICLE V 

   

 _Stock_  

    

 Section 5.1. _Certificates_. Every holder of stock in the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the Corporation, representing the number of shares of stock in the Corporation owned by such holder. If such certificate is manually signed by one officer or manually countersigned by a transfer agent or by a registrar, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has 

   ##### 

  

    

been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer
agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the
Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer,
transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 

   

 Section 5.2. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owners legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate. 

  

ARTICLE VI 

   

 _Miscellaneous_  

    

 Section 6.1. _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be determined by the Board of Directors. 

   

 Section 6.2. _Seal_. The Corporation may have a corporate seal which shall have the name of the Corporation inscribed thereon and shall be in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Board of Directors. The corporate seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced. 

   

 Section 6.3. _Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and Committees_. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under any provision of the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws. 

   

 Section 6.4. _Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees_. The Corporation shall indemnify to the full extent permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such 

   ##### 

  

    

person or such persons testator or intestate is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Corporation or serves or served at the request of the
Corporation any other enterprise as a director, officer or employee.
Expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by any such person in defending
any such action, suit or proceeding shall be paid or reimbursed by the
Corporation promptly upon receipt by it of an undertaking of such person to
repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is
not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. The rights provided to any
person by this by-law shall be enforceable against the Corporation by such
person who shall be presumed to have relied upon it in serving or continuing
to serve as a director, officer or employee as provided above. No amendment
of this by-law shall impair the rights of any person arising at any time
with respect to events occurring prior to such amendment. For purposes of
this by-law, the term "Corporation" shall include any predecessor of the
Corporation and any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed by the Corporation in a consolidation or merger; the
term "other enterprise" shall include any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or employee benefit plan; service "at the request of
the Corporation" shall include service as a director, officer or employee of
the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such
director, officer or employee with respect to an employee benefit plan, its
participants or beneficiaries; any excise taxes assessed on a person with
respect to an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be indemnifiable
expenses; and action by a person with respect to an employee benefit plan
which such person reasonably believes to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of such plan shall be deemed to be action not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. 

   

 Section 6.5. _Interested Directors; Quorum_. No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or (2) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in 

   ##### 

  

    

determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or
of a committee which authorizes the contract or transaction. 

   

 Section 6.6. _Form of Records_. Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs or any other information storage device, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible form within a reasonable time. The Corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon the request of any person entitled to inspect the same. 

   

 Section 6.7. _Amendment of Bylaws_. These Bylaws may be amended or repealed, and new bylaws adopted, by the Board of Directors, but the stockholders entitled to vote may adopt additional bylaws and may amend or repeal any by-law whether or not adopted by them.

ARTICLE II 

   

Scope of Agreement 

   

 2.1. _Scope of Agreement_. Harris and the Company desire to set forth in this Agreement certain terms and conditions upon which Harris will hold its equity interests in the Company, including but not limited its rights as a holder of Class B Common Stock. Solely with respect to Harris rights as a holder of Class B Common Stock, if there is any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the Governing Instruments as a result of any amendment of this Agreement or otherwise, the parties agree to take promptly all necessary action to amend the Governing Instruments to eliminate such inconsistency to the fullest extent permitted by Law. 

  

 2.2. _Governing Instruments and Class B Common Stock_. On or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Harris and Stratex have caused the Company to be incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with Governing Instruments in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_. As of the date of this Agreement, Harris owns, directly or indirectly through its Affiliates, all the outstanding Class B Common Stock and the shareholders of Stratex immediately prior to the Effective Time own all the outstanding Class A Common Stock. Pursuant to the Governing Instruments, the rights and privileges of the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock are identical in all respects except that the holders of the Class B Common Stock have the additional right to vote separately as a class to elect, remove and replace the Class B Directors (the " _Additional Voting Rights_ "), the right to receive Class B Common Stock instead of Class A Common Stock in certain circumstances, the absence of certain duties and obligations with respect to Corporate Opportunities (as defined in the Governing Instruments) and preemptive rights consistent with those granted in Section 4.5 hereof. The holders of Class B Common Stock also have the right at any time to exchange (a) any outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock held by such holder for an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock or (b) any outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock for an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock, in each case as provided in the Governing Instruments. Each outstanding share of Class B Common Stock shall convert into one outstanding share of Class A Common Stock automatically and without any further action by the Company or any other Person if: (i) the holders of all of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (assuming that all the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class B Common Stock have been so exchanged) are collectively entitled to cast less than 10% of the Total Voting Power or (ii) such Class B Common Stock is transferred by a holder to any Person who is not an Affiliate of such holder or a Nominee of such holder or one of its Affiliates; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing no such conversion shall occur if such transfer is part of a transfer by such holder and its Affiliates of all of the shares of Class B Common Stock then owned by them (either directly or through a Nominee (as defined below)) to any other Person or to any other Person and its Affiliates. As of the date of this Agreement, the Class B Common Stock represents 56 % of the outstanding Common Stock determined on a fully diluted basis using the treasury stock method assuming a market price per share of Class A Common Stock equal to $20.80. 

     ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE III 

   

Boards of Directors 

   

 3.1. _Role and Composition of the Board_. (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the Board is comprised of nine directors of which the Initial Harris Directors are the five Class B Directors and the Initial Stratex Directors are the four Class A Directors. Of the Initial Harris Directors, ____________ is an Audit Independent Director, ____________ is not an employee of Harris or any of its Subsidiaries and ____________ is the chief executive officer of the Company, in each case as of the date of this Agreement. Of the Initial Stratex Directors, ____________ and ____________ are Audit Independent Directors and ____________ is the Chairman of the Board, in each case as of the date of this Agreement. All Directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of the Companys shareholders and the Initial Directors shall serve until their successors are elected at the first such annual meeting. Until the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement, one of the Class B Directors must be an Audit Independent Director and one of the other Class B Directors must not be an employee of Harris or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) At all times when the holders of all the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (assuming that all the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class B Common Stock have been so exchanged) are collectively entitled to cast a majority of the Total Voting Power, (i) the Company will rely on the Controlled Company exemption contained in Rule 4350(c)(5) of the NASDAQ Rules, (ii) the Board will be comprised of nine Directors, (iii) the holders of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to elect five of the Directors pursuant to the Additional Voting Rights and the quorum for action by the Board shall be a majority of the Board, which majority shall include at least four Class B Directors and (iv) the remaining four Directors will be Class A Directors nominated by a nominating committee consisting solely of the Class A Directors then in office (the " _Nominating Committee_ "), and elected by the holders of the Common Stock, voting together as a single class; _provided, however,_ that at all times when Rule 4350(d)(2)(A) of the NASDAQ Rules applies to the Company a sufficient number of the Class A Directors must satisfy the requirements of that Rule with respect to the Company so that, together with any Class B Directors which are required or otherwise satisfy such requirements with respect to the Company, there are enough Directors to constitute an audit committee of the Board which complies with the requirements of Rule 4350(d) of the NASDAQ Rules. Harris agrees to vote, or caused to be voted, all Voting Securities owned by it, its Affiliates and their respective Nominees in favor of the election of the Class A Directors nominated by the Nominating Committee pursuant to this Section 3.1(b). 

  

 (c) At all times when the holders of all of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (assuming that all the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class B Common Stock have been so exchanged) are collectively entitled to cast a percentage of the Total Voting Power (the " _Voting Percentage_ ") which is less than a majority but equal to or greater than 10% of the Total Voting Power (i) the Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to elect pursuant to the Additional Voting Rights a number of Class B Directors which represents the Voting Percentage of the total number of Directors then comprising the entire Board (rounded down to the next whole number of Directors), and (ii) the remaining Directors will be Class A Directors nominated by the Nominating Committee (the composition of which shall comply with the requirements of Rule 4350(c)(4) of the NASDAQ 

   ##### 

  

    

Rules) and elected by the holders of the Common Stock, voting together as a
single class;  _provided, however,_ that at all times when such rules apply
to the Company a sufficient number of the Class A Directors must (A) qualify
as an Independent Director with respect to the Company as such term is
defined in Rule 4200(15) of the NASDAQ Rules so that Board complies with
Rule 4350(c)(1) of the NASD Rules and (B) satisfy the requirements of Rule
4350(d)(2)(A) of the NASDAQ Rules with respect to the Company so that,
together with any Class B Directors which are required to or otherwise
satisfy such requirements with respect to the Company, there are enough
Directors to constitute an audit committee which complies with the
requirements of Rule 4350(d) of the NASDAQ Rules. The Nominating Committee
will nominate individuals for election as Class A Directors who comply with
the foregoing requirements and Harris agrees to vote, or cause to be voted,
all Voting Securities owned by it, its Affiliates and their respective
Nominees in favor of the election of such nominees. 

  

 3.2. _Removal and Vacancies_. (a) Without limiting Harris obligations under Section 3.1(a), the holders of the Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class, shall have the sole right to remove the Class B Directors with or without cause at any time and for any reason and the sole right to elect successor Directors to fill any vacancies on the Board caused by any such removals. Any vacancy created by any resignation, death or incapacity of any Class B Director shall be filled by the remaining Class B Directors then in office or, if there are none, by the holders of the Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class. 

  

 (b) The holders of the Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a class, shall have the sole right to remove the Class A Directors without cause and the sole right to appoint successor Directors to fill any vacancies on the Board caused by any such removals. Any vacancy created by the resignation, death or incapacity of any Class A Director shall be filled by the remaining Class A Directors then in office or, if there are none, by the holders of the Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a class. Harris agrees that none of the shares of Class A Common Stock owned by it, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Nominees will be voted for the removal of any Class A Director without cause and all such shares will be voted for the election of the individual nominated by the Nominating Committee to replace any Class A Director who has been removed with or without cause. 

  

 (c) The holders of the Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall have the sole right to remove the Class A Directors for cause and the sole right to elect successor Directors to fill any vacancies on the Board caused by any such removals. 

  

 3.3. _Committees_. At all times, the audit, nominating and compensation committees of the Board shall comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 4350 of the NASDAQ Rules (after taking advantage of all available exemptions for Controlled Companies under such Rules). 

  

 3.4. _Voting Requirements_. All actions of the Board must be approved by a majority of a quorum. 

  

 3.5. _Determination of Total Voting Power_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any transaction or transactions occur which entitle the holders of Class B Common Stock to preemptive rights under Section 4.5, then no determination of the 

   ##### 

  

    

percentage of the Total Voting Power collectively entitled to be cast by the
holders of all the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (assuming that
all the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then
exchangeable for Class B Common Stock have been so exchanged) shall be made
for any purpose under this Agreement until after the exercise or expiration of
all such preemptive rights in respect of all such transactions by such
holders. 

  

ARTICLE IV 

   

Covenants 

   

 4.1. _Standstill Provisions_. For a period of two years from the Closing Date, Harris may not acquire or dispose of beneficial ownership of any Voting Securities of the Company through open-market transactions, third party purchases, business combinations or otherwise except (i) pursuant to Section 4.5, (ii) as a result of any actions taken by the Company that do not increase or decrease the percentage of Voting Power which Harris and its Affiliates are entitled to cast in respect of all Voting Securities beneficially owned by Harris or (iii) with the prior approval of a majority of the Class A Directors. From the second to the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, Harris may not beneficially own Voting Securities which entitle Harris and its Affiliates to cast more than 80% of the Voting Power without the prior approval of a majority of the Class A Directors. From the second until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, Harris may not Transfer Voting Securities entitled to cast a majority of the Voting Power in a single transaction or series of related transactions if a single Person would acquire beneficial ownership of all of such Voting Securities or a portion of such Voting Securities that would entitle such Person to cast a majority of the Total Voting Power unless (i) such Transfer is approved in advance by a majority of the Class A Directors or (ii) such Person offers to acquire all the Voting Securities then owned by each other holder of Voting Securities at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as apply to the Transfer from Harris. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4.1 shall prohibit or restrict any pro rata dividend or other pro rata distributions of Voting Securities to Harris shareholders or any bona fide sale to the public of Voting Securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or a bona fide registered public offering. For all purposes of this Agreement, Harris shall be deemed to beneficially own all Voting Securities beneficially owned by any of its Affiliates. 

  

 4.2. _Access to Information, Audit and Inspection_. As long as Harris continues to beneficially own Voting Securities that entitle it to cast at least 20% of the Total Voting Power: 

  

 (a) Harris and its Representatives shall have (and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide Harris and its Representatives with) full access at reasonable times and during normal business hours to all the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses (including those books and records pertaining to periods prior to the Closing Date), including the right to examine and audit any of such books and records and to make copies and extracts therefrom. Harris shall bear all expenses incurred by it or its Representatives in making any such examination or audit and will reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it or its Subsidiaries in connection therewith. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make arrangements for Harris and its Representatives to have prompt access at reasonable times and during normal business hours to 

   ##### 

  

    

its officers, directors and employees to discuss the business and affairs of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and the books and records pertaining
thereto. The provisions of this Section 4.2(a) shall continue to apply to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and be enforceable by Harris after Harris ceases
to beneficially own any Voting Securities of the Company or Voting
Securities of the Company that entitle it to cast at least 20% of the Voting
Power, but only to the extent, in each case, that such books and records and
such access to officers, directors and other employees are reasonably
requested by Harris in connection with any pending or threatened
Litigation, proceeding or investigation involving Harris or any of its
Affiliates insofar as such matter relates to the business or affairs of the
Company or such Subsidiary (including any matters relating to the business
and affairs of any predecessor businesses, including relating to
periods prior to the Closing Date). 

  

 (b) The Company shall provide Harris with copies of each completed tax return required to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by applicable Law (each, a " _Tax Return_ ") at least 20 Business Days prior to the due date (including any extensions of such due date) of the filing of such Tax Return, and Harris may review such Tax Return prior to its filing with the appropriate Government Entity. The Company shall consult with Harris and negotiate in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the Harris review of such Tax Return. Harris, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use all reasonable good faith efforts to resolve any issue in dispute as promptly as possible, but in any event prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return. In the event an issue resulting from the review by Harris of such Tax Return remains in dispute as of the due date for the filing of such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed with the appropriate Government Entity in accordance with the recommendation of the Companys external tax advisors. 

  

 4.3. _Related Party Transactions_. Harris will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, enter into any transaction or series of related transactions (including any Transfer of any assets or the provision of any goods or services) with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Affiliate Transaction_ ") unless (i) such Affiliate Transaction is on Arms Length Terms and (ii) if the Affiliate Transaction has a Fair Market Value of more than $5 million, such Affiliate Transaction shall have been approved in advance by a majority of the Class A Directors. The foregoing shall not apply to: 

   

 (i) any issuance of securities to, or other payments, awards or grants of in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment arrangements, employee benefits, stock options and stock ownership plans approved by the Board, 

   

 (ii) the payment of reasonable and customary fees to Directors who are not employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, 

   

 (iii) indemnification or insurance arrangements covering directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and 

   

 (iv) any payments or other transactions pursuant to any tax-sharing agreement between the Company and any other Person with which the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

files a consolidated tax return or with which the Company is part of
a consolidated group for tax purposes. 

  

 4.4. _Freedom of Action_. (a) Nothing in this Section 4.4 will impair the Companys ability to enter into contractual arrangements with a shareholder of the Company which restrict the shareholder from engaging in activities otherwise allowed by this Section and the following provisions shall be subject to the terms of any such contractual arrangements. 

  

 (b) Except as expressly provided in the Non-Competition Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, among the Company, Harris and Stratex (the " _Non-Competition Agreement_ ") or the proviso at the end of Section 4.4(c), Harris and its Affiliates shall have the right to, and none of them shall have any fiduciary duty or other obligation to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their shareholders not to, take any of the following actions: 

   

 (i) engage in the same or similar activities or lines of business as the Company or any Subsidiary or develop or market any products or services that compete, directly or indirectly, with those of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; 

   

 (ii) invest or own any interest in, or develop a business relationship with, any Person engaged in the same or similar activities or lines of business as, or otherwise in competition with, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; 

   

 (iii) do business with any client or customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or 

   

 (iv) employ or otherwise engage any former officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) Neither Harris nor any of its Affiliates nor any officer, director, employee or former employee of Harris or any of its Affiliates that is not currently an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Class B Directors) shall have any obligation, or be liable, to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their shareholders for or arising out of the conduct described in Section 4.4(b) or the exercise of Harris rights under any of the Agreements and none of them shall be deemed to have acted (i) in bad faith, (ii) in a manner inconsistent with the best interests of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their shareholders or (iii) in a manner inconsistent with, or opposed to, any fiduciary duty owed by them to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their shareholders by reason of any such conduct or exercise of such rights or any of their participation therein. If Harris or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their directors, officers or employees, including any such individuals who are also directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (collectively, the " _Harris Entities_ ") acquires knowledge of a potential opportunity, transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both Harris or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, (each, a " _Corporate Opportunity_ "), then each of the Harris Entities shall have the right to, and none of them shall have any fiduciary duty or other obligation not to, pursue such Corporate Opportunity for itself or to direct such Corporate Opportunity to any of its Affiliates or to any third party and none of the Harris Entities 

   ##### 

  

  

(i) shall have any duty to communicate, offer or present such Corporate
Opportunity to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, directors, officers or
employees, (ii) shall have any liability to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their shareholders for breach of any fiduciary duty or
other duty, as a shareholder, director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, (iii) shall be deemed to have acted (x)
in bad faith, (y) in a manner inconsistent with the best interests of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their shareholders or (z) in a
manner inconsistent with, or opposed to, any fiduciary duty owed by them to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their shareholders, in each
case by reason of the fact that any Harris Entity pursues or acquires such
Corporate Opportunity for itself, directs such Corporate Opportunity to any
of its Affiliates or any third party, or does not communicate information
regarding such Corporate Opportunity to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers or employees; _provided, however,_ that
notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.4 to the contrary a Corporate
Opportunity offered to a person who is a director or officer of both the
Company and Harris shall belong to the Company if such Corporate Opportunity
is expressly offered to such person in writing solely in his or her capacity
as a director or officer of the Company.

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 4.4 shall be effective to the maximum extent permitted by Law and are not intended to be enforceable to any further extent.

(a) If the Company proposes to issue (a " _Proposed Issuance_ ") any capital stock of the Company or any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, such capital stock (collectively, the " _Offered Securities_ ") at any time when the holders of all the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (assuming that all the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class B Common Stock have been so exchanged) are collectively entitled to cast a majority of the Total Voting Power, the Company shall give written notice of the Proposed Issuance to the holders of Class B Common Stock (the " _Offer Notice_ ") at least 30 days prior to such issuance. Such notice shall describe all the material terms and conditions of such Proposed Issuance. Each holder of Class B Common Stock shall have the right to acquire at the same price and on the same terms and conditions, an additional amount of the Offered Securities so that the percentage of the outstanding Common Stock and Total Voting Power then owned by such holder shall not change as a result of such acquisition and Proposed Issuance; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing (i) such holder may elect to acquire a lesser number of additional Offered Securities as it may determine in its sole discretion and (ii) if the Offered Securities are, or are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, Class A Common Stock, then in lieu thereof such holder shall be entitled to purchase Class B Common Stock or Offered Securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Class B Common Stock, as applicable. If any holder of Class B Common Stock fails to accept such offer by written notice received by the Company within fifteen (15) days following the date on which such holder received the Offer Notice, the Proposed Issuance may be consummated free and clear of the preemptive right granted to the holders of Class B Common Stock under this Section 4.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the purchase price for any Proposed Issuance is to be paid in whole or in part other than in cash, then the holders of Class B Common Stock may pay the purchase price in cash in an amount per Offered Security equal to the fair market value of the aggregate non-cash consideration so payable, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board, divided by the 

   ##### 

  

    

total number of Offered Securities to be issued without giving effect to the
preemptive right granted by this Section 4.5. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the preemptive right granted by this Section 4.5 shall not apply to any Proposed Issuance pursuant to any stock option, restricted stock or employee benefit plan of the Company; _provided, however,_ at the end of each month the Company shall give the holders of Class B Common Stock written notice of all such Proposed Issuances during such month (the " _Monthly Offer Notice_ ") and each holder of Class B Common Stock shall have the right, exercisable by delivering written notice to the Company (each, a " _Monthly Exercise Notice_ ") within fifteen days after the date on which such holder received the Monthly Offer Notice, to purchase for cash a sufficient number of shares of Class B Common Stock so that the percentage of the outstanding Common Stock and Total Voting Power then owned by such holder shall not change as a result of such acquisition and Proposed Issuances; _provided, however,_ that such holder may elect to acquire a lesser number of such shares of Class B Common Stock as it may determine it its sole discretion. The per share purchase price for any purchase of Class B Common Stock pursuant to a Monthly Exercise Notice shall be (i) if the Class A Common Stock is then listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an automated inter-dealer quotation system, the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company received the Monthly Exercise Notice or (ii) in all other cases, the fair market value of one share of Class A Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board. 

  

 4.6. _Covenants Relating to Financial, Accounting and Disclosure Matters_. (a) The Company agrees to comply with the requirements of all of the following paragraphs of this Section 4.6 other than paragraph (m) at all times when Harris is required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") to consolidate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (j), (m) and (n) of this Section 4.6 at all time when Harris is required by GAAP to account for its investment in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the equity method of accounting. 

  

 (b) _Disclosure and Internal Controls_. The Company will (and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to) maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act or any similar or successor rule applicable to Harris. The Company shall cause each of its principal executive and principal financial officers to (i) sign and deliver certifications to its periodic reports and shall include the certifications in its periodic reports, as and when required pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 and Item 601 of Regulation S-K or any similar or successor rule applicable to Harris and (ii) sign and deliver to Harris such certification and representation documents, and to participate in discussions of related matters, with respect to Harris periodic reports under the Exchange Act as Harris may reasonably request. The Company shall cause its management to evaluate its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (including any change in internal control over financial reporting) as and when required pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or any similar or successor rule applicable to Harris. The Company shall disclose in its periodic reports filed with the SEC information concerning its managements responsibilities for and evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (including the annual management report and attestation report of its independent auditors relating to internal control over financial reporting) as and 

   ##### 

  

    

when required under Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K and other applicable
SEC rules. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the
Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) maintain internal
systems and procedures which provide reasonable assurance that (i) its
financial statements are reliable and timely prepared in accordance with GAAP
and applicable Law, (ii) all transactions of the Company and its Subsidiaries
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of their respective
financial statements, (iii) the receipts and expenditures of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are authorized at the appropriate internal level, and (iv)
unauthorized use or disposition of the assets of any the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that could have material effect on their financial
statements is prevented or detected in a timely manner. The Company shall
report in reasonable detail to Harris any of the following events or
circumstances promptly after any executive officer of the Company or any
Director becomes aware of such matter: (i) any significant deficiency or
material weakness in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
internal control over financial reporting of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (iii) any illegal act within the meaning of Section 10A(b) and
(f) of the Exchange Act, and (iv) any report of a material violation of Law
that an attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
formally made to any officers or directors of the Company pursuant to the
SECs attorney conduct rules (17 C.F.R. Part 205). 

  

 (c) _Fiscal Year, Fiscal Quarter and Fiscal Monthly Accounting Periods_. The Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) maintain the same fiscal year, fiscal quarter and fiscal monthly accounting periods as Harris as they may change from time to time. 

  

 (d) _Quarterly and Annual Information_. The Company shall cooperate with Harris and use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Harris consolidated quarterly and annual financial statements of the Company by such dates as Harris shall reasonably determine in order to give Harris reasonable time to review and include such information in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K, as applicable. The Company hereby acknowledges that Harris internal policies and procedures will impose certain requirements on its divisions and subsidiaries with respect to the type and format of financial information provided to Harris management at the end of each fiscal quarter and fiscal year end and that Harris currently requires such information to be so provided no later than the eighth (8th) Business Day following the end of each fiscal quarter and fiscal year end. The Company acknowledges that Harris is a Large Accelerated Filer (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and is required to file its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K with the SEC on an accelerated basis and must make file such reports with the SEC before the Company is currently required to file its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Annual Reports on Form 10-K or may be required to file such reports in the future. Senior employees of the Company and Harris with responsibility for preparation and review of SEC filings will actively consult with each other regarding the details of the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K to be filed by the Company and in particular review any changes (whether or not substantive) that the Company is considering or plans to make to the most recent draft provided to Harris before such documents are filed with the SEC. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Other SEC Filings_. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries which files any information with the SEC (each, a " _Filing Party_ ") shall promptly deliver to Harris: preliminary and substantially final drafts, as soon as the same are prepared, of (i) all reports, notices and proxy and information statements to be sent or made available by such Filing Party to its security holders, (ii) all regular, periodic and other reports (other than those on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q) to be filed or furnished by such Filing Party under Sections 13, 14 and 15 of the Exchange Act, and (iii) all registration statements and prospectuses to be filed by such Filing Party with the SEC or any securities exchange pursuant to the listed company manual (or similar requirements) of such exchange. Thereafter, senior employees of the Company and Harris with responsibility for preparation and review of SEC filings will actively consult with each other regarding any changes (whether or not substantive) that the Company may consider making to such documents before they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. 

  

 (f) _Earnings Releases and Financial Guidance_. Senior employees from the Company and Harris with responsibility for such matters shall consult with each other as to the timing of their annual and quarterly earnings releases and any interim financial guidance for a current or future period and the Company shall give Harris the opportunity to review and comment on the information contained in such releases or guidance. The Company shall make reasonable efforts to issue its respective annual and quarterly earnings releases at approximately the same time on the same date as Harris. No later than eight hours prior to the time and date (or, if the same will be published before noon, no later than 5 p.m. Melbourne, Florida time on the previous Business Day) on which the Company intends to publish its regular annual or quarterly earnings release, any financial guidance for a current or future period or any other matters that could be reasonably likely to have a material financial impact on the earnings, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Harris copies of substantially final drafts of all press releases and other statements relating thereto which will be made available by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to employees or public and senior employees with responsibility for such maters shall consult regarding any changes (other than typographical or other similar minor changes) to such substantially final drafts. Immediately following the issuance thereof, the Company shall deliver to Harris copies of final versions of all such press releases and other public statements. 

  

 (g) _Harris Public Filings_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and to cause its auditors to cooperate with Harris to the extent reasonably requested by Harris in the preparation of Harris public earnings or other press releases, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports to Shareholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any other proxy, information and registration statements, reports, notices, prospectuses and any other filings made by Harris with the SEC or any national securities exchange or otherwise made publicly available by or on behalf of Harris (collectively, the " _Harris Public Filings_ ") and Harris shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection therewith. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Harris all information Harris reasonably requests in connection with any Harris Public Filings or that, in the reasonable judgment of legal advisors to Harris, is required to be disclosed or incorporated by reference therein under applicable Law. The Company shall provide such information in a timely manner on the dates requested by Harris (which may be earlier than the dates on which the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

otherwise would be required hereunder to have such information available) to
enable Harris to prepare, print and release all Harris Public Filings on such
dates as Harris shall reasonably determine but in no event later than as
required by applicable Law. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Company Auditors to consent to any reference to them as
experts in any Harris Public Filings if required under applicable Law. If and
to the extent requested by Harris, the Company shall diligently and promptly
review all drafts of such Harris Public Filings and prepare in a diligent and
timely fashion any portion of such Harris Public Filing pertaining to the
Company. Prior to any printing or public release of any Harris Public Filing,
an appropriate executive officer of the Company shall, if requested by Harris,
certify that the information relating to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their businesses in such Harris Public Filing is accurate, true,
complete and correct in all material respects. Unless required by Law, the
Company shall not publicly release any financial or other information
that conflicts with the information with respect to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses that is included in any
Harris Public Filing without Harris prior written consent. Prior to the
release or filing thereof, Harris shall provide the Company with a draft
of any portion of a Harris Public Filing containing information relating to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their businesses and shall
give the Company an opportunity to review such information and comment
thereon. 

  

 (h) _Company Disclosures_. Nothing in Section 4.6(d), Section 4.6(e), Section 4.6(f) or Section 4.6(n) shall prevent or otherwise limit the ability of the Company to make any disclosure which the Company reasonably believes is necessary to comply with applicable Law, including any changes to drafts previously furnished to Harris. Nothing in Section 4.6(d), Section 4.6(e), Section 4.6(f) or Section 4.6(n) shall prevent or otherwise limit the ability of Harris to make any disclosure which Harris reasonably believes is necessary to comply with applicable Law, including any changes to drafts previously furnished to the Company. 

  

 (i) _Consistency of Accounting Principles, Policies and Practices_. All information to be provided to Harris by, or with respect to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement shall be consistent in terms of format, detail and otherwise with the accounting principles, policies and practices of Harris, with such changes therein as may be requested by Harris from time to time consistent with changes in such accounting principles, policies and practices. Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall give Harris as much prior notice as reasonably practicable of any proposed determination of, or any significant changes in, the Companys accounting estimates or accounting principles. Senior employees of Harris and the Company with responsibility for accounting and financial reporting shall consult with each other (and their respective auditors, if requested) with respect to any such proposed determination or change. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the Company shall not make any such determination or changes without the prior written consent of Harris if such a determination or change would be sufficiently material to be required to be disclosed in financial statements or other disclosure documents filed by the Company or Harris with the SEC. 

  

 (j) _Auditors_. Ernst and Young shall initially serve as the independent certified public accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Auditors_ "). The Company shall thereafter maintain as the Company Auditors the same firm (and its affiliated firms) as Harris appoints to act as the independent certified public accountants for Harris and its Subsidiaries, unless and until the audit committee of the Company determines in good faith that 

   ##### 

  

    

it is required by Law or that it is in the best interest of the stockholders
of the Company to appoint a different independent certified public accountant
for the Company than that appointed by Harris for Harris and its
Subsidiaries. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enable
the Company Auditors to complete their audit such that they may date their
opinion on the audited financial statements of the Company (the " _Annual
Financial Statements_ ") on the same date that Harris independent certified
public accountants (the " _Harris Auditors_ ") date their opinion on the
audited annual financial statements of Harris (the " _Harris
Annual Statements_ ") and to enable Harris to meet its timetable for the
printing, filing and public dissemination of the Harris Annual Statements,
all in accordance with this Agreement and as required by applicable Law. The
Company shall request that the Company Auditors date their opinion on the
Annual Financial Statements on the same date that the Harris Auditors date
their opinion on the Harris Annual Statements. The Company shall provide to
Harris on a timely basis all information Harris reasonably requires to meet
its schedule for the preparation, printing, filing and public dissemination
of the Harris Annual Statements in accordance with this Agreement and
as required by applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall provide all required financial information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Company Auditors in a
sufficient and reasonable time and in sufficient detail to permit the
Company Auditors to take all steps and perform all reviews necessary to
provide sufficient assistance to Harris Auditors with respect to information
to be included or contained in the Harris Annual Statements. The Company
shall authorize the Company Auditors to make available to the Harris Auditors
both the personnel who performed, or are performing, the annual audit of the
Company and work papers related to the annual audit of the Company, in all
cases within a reasonable time prior to the opinion date for the Company
Auditors, so that the Harris Auditors are able to perform the procedures they
consider necessary to take responsibility for the work of the Company Auditors
as it relates to the report of the Harris Auditors on the Harris financial
statements, all within sufficient time to enable Harris to meet its timetable
for the printing, filing and public dissemination of the Harris Annual
Statements. 

  

 (k) _Inaccuracies_. If Harris determines in good faith that there may be an inaccuracy in any financial statements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any deficiency in the internal accounting controls or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could materially impact Harris financial statements, then upon request the Company shall provide to Harris internal auditors access to the books and records of Harris and its Subsidiaries so that Harris may conduct reasonable audits relating to the financial statements provided by the Company under this Agreement as well as to the internal accounting controls and operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Harris shall be responsible for the fees and expense of its internal auditors in connection with such audits but shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection therewith. 

  

 (l) _Information for Equity Accounting Periods_. The Company shall provide to Harris on a timely basis all information Harris reasonably requires to meet its schedule for the preparation, printing, filing and public dissemination of the Harris Annual Statements in accordance with this Agreement and as required by applicable Law, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall provide all required financial information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Company Auditors in a sufficient and reasonable time and in sufficient detail to permit the Company Auditors to take all steps and 

   ##### 

  

    

perform all reviews necessary to provide sufficient assistance to Harris
Auditors with respect to information to be included or contained in the
Harris Annual Statements. 

  

 (m) _Certifications_. The Company shall provide to Harris certifications from appropriate employees of the Company, at the times and in form and substance reasonably requested by Harris, to provide backup support for any certifications by any officers of Harris which are required to be included as part of, or as an exhibit to, any report filed by Harris under the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, Item 601 of Regulation S-K or any successor or additional rule or regulation; _provided, however,_ that such employees need only provide such certifications to the extent they believe they accurately characterize the matters described therein. 

  

 (n) _Nonpublic Information_. Each party recognizes that information shared pursuant to this Article IV may constitute material nonpublic inside information, and will use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to treat such material nonpublic information as confidential, (ii) in the case of Stratex only, not to disclose it to any Person who is not an employee or director of such party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their advisers who need to know such information for purposes of carrying out the provisions of this Section 4.6. and (iii) in the case of Harris only, not to disclose it to any Person who is not an employee or director of such party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their advisers who need to know such information for purposes of advising Harris with respect to its investment in the Company or carrying out the provisions of this Section 4.6. 

  

 4.7. _Option Exercise_. If and to the extent the Company shall determine to use the proceeds from the exercise of any options to acquire Common Stock to repurchase shares of Class A Common Stock in the market at the then prevailing market price, at the request of Harris or otherwise, such determination or repurchase shall not be deemed to be an Affiliate Transaction or a breach by Harris or any Class B Director of any duty or obligation they may have to the Company or its stockholders. 

  

ARTICLE V 

   

Miscellaneous 

   

 5.1. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate at the first time at which the Total Voting Power of Voting Securities owned by Harris, its Affiliates and their respective Nominees collectively represent less than 10% of the Total Voting Power. 

  

 5.2. _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver Of Jury Trial_. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the 

   ##### 

  

    

transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in any Delaware Court or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced
in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all
claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined in any Delaware Court; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding
the foregoing each party agrees that any claim which primarily seeks
injunctive relief and related monetary claims that cannot be brought in any
Delaware Court for jurisdiction reasons may be commenced, heard
and determined in any other court having proper jurisdiction over such claim.
The parties hereby consent to and grant any Delaware Court jurisdiction over
the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by law, over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in  _Section 5.6_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall
be valid and sufficient service thereof. 

  

 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 5.2_. 

  

 5.3. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. If necessary to effect the intent of the parties, the parties will negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to replace the unenforceable language with enforceable language which as closely as possible reflects such intent. 

  

 5.4. _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended or any performance, term or condition waived in whole or in part only by a writing signed by persons authorized to so bind each party (in the case of an amendment) or the waiving party (in the case of a waiver). Any such amendment or waiver by the Company shall require the prior approval of a majority of the Class A Directors. No failure or delay by any party to take any action with respect to a breach by another party of this Agreement or a default by another party hereunder shall constitute a waiver of the former partys right to enforce any provision of this Agreement or 

   ##### 

  

    

to take action with respect to such breach or default or any subsequent breach
or default. Waiver by any party of any breach or failure to comply with any
provision of this Agreement by another party shall not be construed as, or
constitute, a continuing wavier of such provisions, or a waiver of any other
breach of or failure to comply with any other provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 5.5. _Assignment_. Harris shall be entitled to assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Person to whom it transfers all of the ownership interests in the Company then owned by Harris and its Affiliates if such Person delivers a written undertaking to the Company in which such Person expressly assumes all of Harris obligations under this Agreement, and from and after such a transfer all references herein to Harris shall be deemed to be references to such Person. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no party may assign this Agreement or any rights, benefits, obligations or remedies hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, except that no such consent shall be required for a transfer by operation of Law in connection with a merger or consolidation of such party. Any attempt so to assign or to delegate any of the foregoing without such consent shall be void and of no effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by and against the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. All certificates representing shares subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall bear an appropriate legend with respect thereto. 

  

 5.6. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is intended to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other Person any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or in respect to this Agreement or any provision herein contained.

 WHEREAS, Harris and Stratex have entered into a Formation, Contribution and Merger Agreement, dated as of September 5, 2006 (the " _Formation Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Company was formed to acquire Stratex pursuant to the Merger and to receive the Contributed Assets from Harris in the Contribution Transaction, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Formation Agreement;

 WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition to closing under the Formation Agreement. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants in the Agreements, the parties agree as follows: 

   

 1. _Definitions_.

In addition, all capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Formation Agreement; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Harris or any of its other Subsidiaries or Affiliates for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 2\. _Non-Competition_. In consideration for the issuance to Harris of shares of the Company pursuant to the Formation Agreement and the performance by Stratex of its obligations under the Agreements (collectively, the " _Non-Compete Consideration_ "), Harris agrees that, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the fifth anniversary of the date hereof, Harris will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to (a) engage, directly or indirectly, in the Restricted Business, (b) form any Person other than the Company and its Subsidiaries (a " _Covered Person_ ") or change or extend the current business activities of any existing Covered Person for the purpose of engaging, directly or indirectly, in the Restricted Business or (c) invest, directly or indirectly, in any Covered Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in the Restricted Business in any material respect; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing Harris and/or its Subsidiaries may (i) collectively own less than 20% of the total equity interests in any Covered Person engaged in the Restricted Business as 

   ##### 

  

 

long as none of the employees of Harris or any of its Subsidiaries is involved
in the management of such Covered Person, (ii) participate as a passive
investor with no management rights in any investment fund that holds an
ownership interests in Covered Persons engaged in the Restricted Business
which is managed by Persons that are not Affiliates of Harris (each, an "
_Unaffiliated Person_ ") (x) with any employee benefit or retirement plan
funds and (y) with any other funds subject, in the case of this clause (y)
only, to a maximum interest in such investment fund of 15% and (iii) acquire
a Covered Person or business unit of a Covered Person engaged in the
Restricted Business if (x) the Restricted Business contributed less than 20%
of such Covered Persons or business units, as applicable, total revenues
(based on its latest annual audited financial statements, if available) and
(y) such Covered Person or Harris, as applicable, divests or ceases to
conduct the Restricted Business within 18 months after the acquisition
date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the defined
term "Restricted Business" shall not include, and the prohibition contained
in this _Section 2_ shall in no way prohibit Harris and/or its Subsidiaries
from, (a) purchasing and reselling products produced by, and marked with the
brands of, an Unaffiliated Person in connection with the sale, service, design
or maintenance of a system that contains or uses microwave radios or related
components, systems or services or (b) developing, manufacturing,
distributing or selling microwave radios or related components, systems or
services for use by Government Entities. 

   

 3. _Sufficiency of Consideration_. Each of the parties acknowledges that the Non-Compete Consideration is sufficient consideration for the duration and scope of the non-competition agreement contained herein and that such duration and scope are reasonable in all respects. 

  

 4. _Severability; Enforceability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or any part thereof, is held by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court or authority making such determination will have the power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision or to delete specific words or phrases as necessary (but only to the minimum extent necessary) to cause such provision or part to be valid and enforceable. If such court or authority does not have the legal authority to take the actions described in the preceding sentence, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith a modified provision that would, in so far as possible, reflect the original intent of this Agreement without violating applicable law. 

  

 5. _Availability of Injunctive Relief_. The parties hereto acknowledge and recognize that irreparable damage could result to the Company and its Subsidiaries, businesses and properties if Harris fails or refuses to perform its obligations under this Agreement and that no adequate remedy at law will exist for any breach by Harris of this Agreement. In addition to any other rights or remedies and damages available, the Company shall be entitled to appropriate injunctive relief, including preliminary and mandatory injunctive relief, enjoining or restraining Harris or any of its Subsidiaries from any violation or threatened violation of this Agreement. 

  

 6\. _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE 

   ##### 

  

 

CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to
the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal
courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware
(collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby
waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or
proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit
or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in any Delaware Court
or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or
any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in any Delaware Court; _provided,
however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing each party agrees that any claim
which primarily seeks injunctive relief and related monetary claims that
cannot be brought in any Delaware Court for jurisdiction reasons may be
commenced, heard and determined in any other court having proper jurisdiction
over such claim. The parties hereby consent to and grant any Delaware Court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by
law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in _Section 12_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. 

   

 (b) Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) each party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 6_. 

   

 7. _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended or any performance, term or condition waived in whole or in part only by a writing signed by persons authorized to so bind each party (in the case of an amendment) or the waiving party (in the case of a waiver). No failure or delay by any party to take any action with respect to a breach by another party of this Agreement or a default by another party hereunder shall constitute a waiver of the former partys right to enforce any provision of this Agreement or to take action with respect to such breach or default or any subsequent breach or default. Waiver by any party of any breach or failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement by another party shall not be construed as, or constitute, a continuing wavier of such provisions, or a waiver of any other breach of or failure to comply with any other provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 9\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto 

   ##### 

  

 

were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). 

   

 10. _Successors in Interest; Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon and enforceable against the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each other party hereto. 

  

 11. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is intended solely for the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and shall not confer upon any other person any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement or other right. The Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed to create any third party beneficiaries or to provide to any third parties with any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right or privilege.

 2. _Demand Registrations_. (a) Each Holder shall have the right, subject to the terms of this Agreement, to require the Company to register for offer and sale under the Securities Act all or a portion of the Registrable Securities then owned by such Holder subject to the requirements and limitations in this _Section 2_. In order to exercise such right, the Holder (the " _Demanding Holder_ ") must give written notice to the Company (a " _Demand Notice_ ") requesting that the Company register under the Securities Act the offer and sale of Registrable Securities (i) 

   ##### 

  

  

having a market value on the date the Demand Notice is received (the " _Demand
Date_ ") of at least $50 million based on the then prevailing market price,
(ii) representing at least 5% of the outstanding Common Stock (on a fully
diluted basis) or (iii) representing all of the Registrable Securities then
held by such Holder and its Affiliates. Upon receipt of the Demand Notice,
the Company shall (i) promptly notify the other Holders of the receipt of such
Demand Notice, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission as soon as
practicable and in no event later than 90 days after the Demand Date a Demand
Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Applicable
Securities on any available form requested by the Demanding Holder (which may
include a "shelf" Registration Statement under Rule 415 promulgated under the
Securities Act solely for use in connection with delayed underwritten
offerings under Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act) and (iii) use
reasonable efforts to cause such Demand Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable. The
Company shall use reasonable efforts to have each Demand Registration
Statement remain effective until the earlier of (i) two years (in the case of
a shelf Demand Registration Statement) or 90 days (in the case of any
other Demand Registration Statement) from the Effective Time of such
Registration Statement and (ii) such time as all of the Applicable Securities
have been disposed of by the Electing Holders.

   

 (b) The Company shall have the right to postpone (or, if necessary or advisable, withdraw) the filing, or to delay the effectiveness, of a Registration Statement or offers and sales of Applicable Securities registered under a shelf Demand Registration Statement if the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith that such Registration would interfere with any pending financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other corporate transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or would otherwise be seriously detrimental to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and furnishes to the Electing Holders a copy of a resolution of the board of directors of the Company setting forth such determination; _provided, however_ , that the Company may postpone a Demand Registration or offers and sales of Applicable Securities under a shelf Demand Registration Statement no more than once in any 12 month period and that no single postponement shall exceed 90 days in the aggregate. The Company shall advise the Electing Holders of any such determination as promptly as practicable. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2_, the Company shall not be obligated to take any action under _this Section 2_: 

  

       | (i)  |   | with respect to more than four non-shelf Demand
Registration Statements relating to underwritten offerings which have become
effective and which covered all the Registrable Securities requesting to be
included therein, or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | with respect to more than two shelf Demand
Registration Statements which have become and remained effective as required
by this Agreement.  
   

  

 (d) The Company may include in any registration requested pursuant to _Section 2(a)_ hereof other securities for sale for its own account or for the account of another Person, subject to the following sentence. In connection with an underwritten offering, if the managing 

   ##### 

  

    

underwriter advises the Company and the Electing Holders in writing that in
its opinion the number of securities requested to be registered exceeds the
maximum number which can be sold in such offering without materially
adversely affecting the pricing, timing or likely success of the offering
(with respect to any offering, the " _Maximum Number_ "), the Company shall
include such Maximum Number in such Registration as follows: (i) first, the
Applicable Securities requested to be registered by the Demanding Holder,
(ii) second, the Applicable Securities requested to be included by any other
Electing Holders, if any, (iii) third, any securities proposed to be
included by the Company and (iv) fourth, any other securities requested to be
included in such Registration. For purposes of this Agreement, an "
_underwritten offering_ " shall be an offering pursuant to which securities
are sold to a broker-dealer or other financial institution or group thereof
for resale by them to investors. 

  

 (e) The Demanding Holder shall have the right to withdraw its Demand Notice (in which case such Demand Notice shall be deemed never to have been given for purposes of _Section 2(a)_) (i) at any time prior to the time the Demand Registration Statement has been declared or becomes effective if the Demanding Holder reimburses the Company for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it prior to such withdrawal in effecting such Registration, (ii) upon the issuance by the Commission or any court or other governmental agency or authority of a stop order, injunction or other order which prohibits or interferes with such Registration, (iii) if the conditions to closing specified in the purchase agreement or underwriting agreement entered into in connection with such registration are not satisfied other than as a result of default by the Demanding Holder, (iv) there has been a material adverse change in market conditions or in the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects since the date of such Demand Notice, or (v) if the Company exercises any of its rights under _Section 2(b)_ of this Agreement. If the Holders withdraw a Demand Notice pursuant to this _Section 2(e)_ and the Company nevertheless decides to continue with the Registration as to securities other than the Applicable Securities, then the Holders shall be entitled to participate in such Registration pursuant to _Section 3_ hereof, but in such case the Intended Offering Notice must be given to the Holders at least 10 business days prior to the anticipated filing date of the Registration Statement and the Holders shall be required to give the Piggyback Notice no later than five business days after the Companys delivery of such Intended Offering Notice. 

  

 (f) If any Registration pursuant to this _Section 2_ shall relate to an underwritten offering, the Demanding Holder shall select the managing underwriter or underwriters with the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the right of any other Holder to participate therein shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in the underwriting agreements and arrangements required by this Agreement. 

  

 3. _Piggyback Registrations_. (a) If at any time the Company intends to file on its behalf or on behalf of any holder of its securities a Registration Statement under the Securities Act in connection with a public offering of any securities of the Company (other than a registration statement on Form S-8 or Form S-4 or their successor forms), then the Company shall give written notice of such intention (an " _Intended Offering Notice_ ") to each Holder at least 

   ##### 

  

  

20 business days prior to the date such Registration Statement is filed. Such
Intended Offering Notice shall offer to include in such Registration
Statement for offer to the public the number or amount of Registrable
Securities as each such Holder may request, subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and shall specify, to the extent then known, the number and
class of securities proposed to be registered, the proposed date of filing of
such Registration Statement, any proposed means of distribution of such
securities, any proposed managing underwriter or underwriters of such
securities, together with a good faith estimate by the Company of the
proposed maximum offering price of such securities. Any Holder that elects to
have its Registrable Securities offered and sold pursuant to such
Registration Statement shall so advise the Company in writing (such written
notice from any such Holder being a " _Piggyback Notice_ ") not later than
seven business days after the date on which such Holder received the Intended
Offering Notice, setting forth the number of Registrable Securities that such
Holder desires to have offered and sold pursuant to such Registration
Statement. Upon the request of the Company, the Electing Holders shall enter
into such underwriting, custody and other agreements as shall be customary
in connection with registered secondary offerings or necessary or appropriate
in connection with the offering. Each Holder shall be permitted to withdraw
all or part of its Applicable Securities from any Registration pursuant to
this _Section 3_ at any time prior to the sale thereof (or, if applicable,
the entry into a binding agreement for such sale). If any Registration
pursuant to this  _Section 3_ shall relate to an underwritten offering, the
right of any Holder to participate therein shall be conditioned upon such
Holders participation in the underwriting agreements and arrangements
required by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) In connection with an underwritten offering, if the managing underwriter or underwriters advise the Company in writing that in its or their opinion the number of securities proposed to be registered exceeds the Maximum Number with respect to such offering, the Company shall include in such Registration such Maximum Number as follows: (i) first, the securities that the Company proposes to sell, (ii) second, the Applicable Securities requested to be included in such Registration _pro rata_ among the Electing Holders thereof based on the respective amount of Applicable Securities owned by them and (iii) third, if any, securities held by other holders of securities of the Company who have requested that their securities be included in such Registration Statement and who hold contractual registration rights with respect to such securities. 

  

 (c) The rights of the Holders pursuant to _Section 2_ hereof and this _Section 3_ are cumulative, and the exercise of rights under one such Section shall not exclude the subsequent exercise of rights under the other such Section (except to the extent expressly provided otherwise herein). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company may abandon and/or withdraw any registration as to which rights under _Section 3_ may exist (or have been exercised) at any time and for any reason without liability hereunder. In such event, the Company shall notify each Holder that has delivered a Piggyback Notice to participate therein. No Registration of Registrable Securities effected pursuant to a request under this _Section 3_ shall be deemed to be, or shall relieve the Company of its obligation to effect, a Registration upon request under  _Section 2_ hereof. The Company may enter into other registration rights agreements;  _provided,_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _however_ , that the rights and benefits of a holder of securities of the
Company with respect to registration of such securities as contained in any
such other agreement shall not be inconsistent with, or adversely affect, the
rights and benefits of holders of Registrable Securities as contained in this
Agreement. 

  

 4. _Registration Procedures_. In connection with a Registration Statement, the following provisions shall apply: 

  

 (a) Each Electing Holder shall in a timely manner (i) deliver to the Company and its counsel a duly completed copy of any form of notice and questionnaire reasonably requested by the Company and (ii) provide the Company and its counsel with such other information as to itself as may be required by law for inclusion in the Registration Statement. 

  

 (b) The Company shall furnish to each Electing Holder, prior to the Effective Time, a copy of the Registration Statement initially filed with the Commission, and shall furnish to such Electing Holders copies of each amendment thereto and each amendment or supplement, if any, to the Prospectus included therein. 

  

 (c) The Company shall promptly take such action as may be reasonably necessary so that (i) each of the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and the Prospectus forming part thereof and any amendment or supplement thereto (and each report or other document incorporated therein by reference in each case), when it becomes effective, complies in all material respects with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) each of the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) each of the Prospectus forming part of the Registration Statement, and any amendment or supplement to such Prospectus, does not at any time during the period during which the Company is required to keep a Registration Statement continuously effective under _Section 2(a)_ (other than any period during which it is entitled and elects to postpone offers and sales under _Section 2(b)_ (each, a " _Postponement Period_ ")) include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 (d) The Company shall, promptly upon learning thereof, advise each Electing Holder, and shall confirm such advice in writing if so requested by any such Electing Holder: 

  

       | (i)  |   | when the Registration Statement and any amendment
thereto has been filed with the Commission and when the Registration
Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | of any request by the Commission for amendments or
supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus included therein
or for additional information;  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (iii)  |   | of the issuance by the Commission of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the
initiation of any proceedings for such purpose;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (iv)  |   | of the receipt by the Company of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification of the securities included in
the Registration Statement for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of
any proceeding for such purpose;  
      
    | (v)  |   | following the effectiveness of any Registration
Statement, of the happening of any event or the existence of any state of
facts that requires the making of any changes in the Registration Statement
or the Prospectus included therein so that, as of such date, such
Registration Statement and Prospectus do not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact and do not omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the
Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading (which advice shall be accompanied by an instruction to such
Electing Holders to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite
changes have been made which instruction such Electing Holders agree to
follow); and  
      
    | (vi)  |   | if at any time any of the representations and
warranties of the Company contemplated by paragraph (l) below cease to be
true and correct or will not be true and correct as of the closing date for
the offering.  
   

  

 (e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance, and if issued to obtain the withdrawal, of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement at the earliest possible time. 

  

 (f) The Company shall furnish to each Electing Holder, without charge, at least one copy of the Registration Statement and all post-effective amendments thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if such Electing Holder so requests in writing, all reports, other documents and exhibits that are filed with or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. 

  

 (g) The Company shall, during the period during which the Company is required to keep a Registration Statement continuously effective under _Section 2(a)_ or elects to keep effective under _Section 3(a)_, deliver to each Electing Holder and any managing underwriter or agent, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus (including each preliminary Prospectus) included in the Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto and other documents as they may reasonably request to facilitate the distribution of the Registrable Securities; and the Company consents (except during the continuance of any event described in _Section 4(d)(v)_ hereof) to the use of the Prospectus, with any amendment or supplement thereto, by each of the Electing Holders and any managing underwriter or agent in connection with the 

   ##### 

  

    

offering and sale of the Applicable Securities covered by the Prospectus and
any amendment or supplement thereto during such period. 

  

 (h) Prior to any offering of Applicable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement, the Company shall (i) use reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the Electing Holders and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification of such Applicable Securities for offer and sale under any applicable securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as any Electing Holder may reasonably request, (ii) use reasonable efforts to keep such registrations or qualifications in effect and comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of offers and sales in such jurisdictions for the period during which the Company is required to keep a Registration Statement continuously effective under  _Section 2(a)_ or elects to keep effective under _Section 3(a)_ and (iii) take any and all other actions reasonably requested by an Electing Holder which are necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of such Applicable Securities; _provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section 4(h)_ shall require the Company to (A) qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this _Section 4(h)_ or (B) take any action which would subject it to general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not then so subject. 

  

 (i) The Company shall, if requested by the Electing Holders, use reasonable best efforts to cause all such Applicable Securities to be sold pursuant to the Registration Statement to be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation service on which securities of the Company are listed or quoted. 

  

 (j) The Company shall cooperate with the Electing Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Applicable Securities to be sold pursuant to the Registration Statement, which certificates shall comply with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation service on which any securities of the Company are listed and quoted, and which certificates shall be free of any restrictive legends and in such permitted denominations and registered in such names as Electing Holders or any managing underwriter or agent may request in connection with the sale of Applicable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement. 

  

 (k) Upon the occurrence of any fact or event contemplated by _Section 4(d)(v)_ hereof, the Company shall promptly prepare a post-effective amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any document incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, after such amendment or supplement, such Registration Statement and Prospectus do not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and do not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading;  _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be required to take any such action during a Postponement Period (but it shall promptly thereafter). In the event that the Company notifies the Electing Holders of the occurrence of any fact or event contemplated by _Section_  

   ##### 

  

  

 _4(d)(v)_ hereof, each Electing Holder agrees, as a condition of the
inclusion of any of such Electing Holders Applicable Securities in the
Registration Statement, to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the
requisite changes to the Prospectus have been made.

   

 (l) The Company shall, together with all Electing Holders, enter into such customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form in the event of an underwritten offering) and take all other reasonable and appropriate action in order to expedite and facilitate the registration and disposition of the Registrable Securities, and in connection therewith, if an underwriting agreement is entered into, cause the same to contain indemnification provisions and procedures substantially similar to those set forth in _Section 6_ hereof with respect to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 6_ hereof. In addition, in such agreements, the Company will make such representations and warranties to the Electing Holder(s) and the underwriters or agents, if any, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers in primary equity offerings. The Electing Holder(s) shall be party to such agreements and may, at their option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of the Electing Holders and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of the Electing Holders. No Electing Holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or the underwriters or agents other than representations, warranties or agreements relating to such Electing Holder, its Registrable Securities and its intended method of distribution or any other representations required by law. 

  

 (m) If requested by the managing underwriter in any underwritten offering, the Company and each Holder (whether or not an Electing Holder) will agree to such limitations on sale, transfer, short sale, hedging, option, swap and other transactions as are then customary in underwriting agreements for registered underwritten offerings; _provided, however_ , that such limitations shall not continue beyond the 180th day after the effective date of the Registration Statement in question or, if later, the commencement of the public distribution of securities to the extent timely notified in writing by the managing underwriters. 

  

 (n) The Company shall use best efforts to: 

  

       | (i)  |   | (A) make reasonably available for inspection by
Electing Holders, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant
to the Registration Statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent
retained by such Holders or any such underwriter all relevant financial and
other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company
and its subsidiaries, and (B) cause the Companys officers, directors and
employees to participate in road shows or other customary marketing
activities and to supply all information reasonably requested by such
Electing Holders or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in
connection with the Registration Statement as is customary for similar due  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | diligence examinations; _provided, however_ , that all
records, information and documents that are designated by the Company, in
good faith, as confidential shall be kept confidential by such Holders and
any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent, unless such disclosure
is required in connection with a court proceeding after such advance notice
to the Company (to the extent practicable in the circumstances) so as to
permit the Company to contest the same, or required by law, or such records,
information or documents become available to the public generally or through
a third party without an accompanying obligation of confidentiality; and
_provided further_  that, the foregoing inspection and information gathering
shall, to the greatest extent possible, be coordinated on behalf of the
Electing Holders and the other parties entitled thereto by one counsel
designated by and on behalf of the Electing Holders and such other parties;  
---|---|---|--- 
     | (ii)  |   | in connection with any underwritten offering, obtain
opinions of counsel to the Company (which counsel and opinions (in form,
scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the underwriters)
addressed to the underwriters, covering the matters customarily covered in
opinions requested in secondary underwritten offerings of equity securities,
to the extent reasonably required by the applicable underwriting agreement;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | in connection with any underwritten offering, obtain
"cold comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent public
accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, from the independent public
accountants of any Subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by
the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are
required to be, included in the Registration Statement), addressed to each
Electing Holder participating in such underwritten offering (if such Electing
Holder has provided such letter, representations or documentation, if any,
required for such cold comfort letter to be so addressed) and the
underwriters, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily
covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with secondary underwritten
offerings of equity securities;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | in connection with any underwritten offering, deliver
such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by any
Electing Holders participating in such underwritten offering and the
underwriters, if any, including, without limitation, certificates to evidence
compliance with any conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or
other agreements entered into by the Company; and  
      
    | (v)  |   | use its best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Commission and make generally available to its
security holders, as  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | soon as reasonably practicable (but not more than
fifteen months) after the effective date of the Registration Statement, an
earnings statement satisfying the provisions of _Section 11(a)_ of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 (o) Not later than the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement, the Company shall provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities and provide the applicable transfer agent with printed certificates for the Registrable Securities which are in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company. 

  

 (p) The Company shall cooperate with each Electing Holder and each underwriter or agent participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with the NASD. 

  

 (q) As promptly as practicable after filing with the Commission of any document which is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, the Company shall provide copies of such document to counsel for each Electing Holder and to the managing underwriters and agents, if any. 

  

 (r) The Company shall provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement from and after a date not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement. 

  

 (s) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all other steps necessary to effect the timely registration, offering and sale of the Applicable Securities covered by the Registration Statements contemplated hereby. 

  

 5. _Registration Expenses_. The Company shall bear all of the Registration Expenses and all other expenses incurred by it in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. The Electing Holders shall bear all other expenses relating to any Registration or sale in which such Electing Holders participate, including without limitation the fees and expenses of counsel to such Electing Holders and any applicable underwriting discounts or commissions. 

  

 6. _Indemnification and Contribution_. (a) Upon the Registration of Applicable Securities pursuant to _Section 2_ or _Section 3_ hereof, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Electing Holder and each underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional, if any, which facilitates the disposition of Applicable Securities, and each of their respective officers and directors and each person who controls such Electing Holder, underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional within the meaning of _Section 15_ of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each such Person, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Indemnified Person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue 

   ##### 

  

    

statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement under which such Applicable Securities are to be
registered under the Securities Act, or any Prospectus contained therein or
furnished by the Company to any Indemnified Person, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company
hereby agrees to reimburse such Indemnified Person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; _provided,
however_ , that the Company shall not be liable to any such Indemnified
Person in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such
Registration Statement or Prospectus, or amendment or supplement, in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by
such Indemnified Person or its agent expressly for use therein; and
_provided, further,_ that the Company shall not be liable to the extent that
any loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect
thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon the use of any Prospectus
after such time as the Company has advised the Electing Holder in writing that
a post-effective amendment or supplement thereto is required, except such
Prospectus as so amended or supplemented. 

  

 (b) Each Electing Holder agrees, as a consequence of the inclusion of any of such Holders Applicable Securities in such Registration Statement, and shall cause each underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional, if any, which facilitates the disposition of Applicable Securities shall agree, as a consequence of facilitating such disposition of Applicable Securities, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such other persons may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Holder, underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional, as applicable, expressly for use therein; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary the maximum aggregate amount that any Electing Holder shall be required to pay pursuant to this _Section 6_ in respect of any Registration shall be the net proceeds received by such Electing Holder from sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration. 

  

 (c) Promptly after receipt by any Person entitled to indemnity under _Section 6(a)_ or (b) hereof (an " _Indemnitee_ ") of any notice of the commencement of any action or claim, such 

   ##### 

  

    

Indemnitee shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any
other person under this _Section 6_ (an " _Indemnitor_ "), notify such
Indemnitor in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to
notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve it from any liability which it may
have to any Indemnitee except to the extent the Indemnitor is
actually prejudiced thereby. In case any such action shall be brought against
any Indemnitee and it shall notify an Indemnitor of the commencement thereof,
such Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent
that it shall wish, jointly with any other Indemnitor similarly notified, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnitee (which shall not be counsel to the Indemnitor without the consent
of the Indemnitee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
After notice from the Indemnitor to such Indemnitee of its election so to
assume the defense thereof, such Indemnitor shall not be liable to
such Indemnitee under this _Section 6_ or otherwise for any legal expenses
of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by
such Indemnitee, in connection with the defense thereof (other than
reasonable costs of investigation) unless the Indemnitee shall have been
advised by counsel that representation of the Indemnitee by counsel provided
by the Indemnitor would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
conflicting interests between the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor, including
situations in which there are one or more legal defenses available to
the Indemnitee that are different from or additional to those available to
Indemnitor; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnitor shall not, in
connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar
actions arising out of the same general allegations, be liable for the
fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel at any time for all
Indemnitees, except to the extent that local counsel, in addition to their
regular counsel, is required in order to effectively defend against such
action. No Indemnitor shall, without the written consent of the Indemnitee,
effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in
respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
(whether or not the Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such action
or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes
an unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an
admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any
Indemnitee. No indemnification shall be available in respect of
any settlement of any action or claim effected by an Indemnitee without the
prior written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (d) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6_ is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnitee under _Section 6(a)_ or _Section 6(b)_ hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each Indemnitor shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or 

   ##### 

  

    

alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
such Indemnitor or by such Indemnitee, and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 6(d)_ were determined
solely by pro rata allocation (even if the Electing Holders or any
underwriters, selling agents or other securities professionals or all of them
were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the considerations referred to in
this _Section 6(d)_. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnitee as a
result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees
or expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of _Section 11(f)_ of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the
Electing Holders and any underwriters, selling agents or other securities
professionals in this _Section 6(d)_ to contribute shall be several in
proportion to the percentage of Applicable Securities registered or
underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint. 

  

 7. _Miscellaneous_. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 7(d)_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. 

  

 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, 

   ##### 

  

    

OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III)
EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 7(A)_ AND _SECTION 7(B)_. 

  

 (c) This Agreement may be amended, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may be given, only by a written instrument duly executed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company and the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding, or in the case of a waiver or consent, by the party against whom such waiver or consent is to be effective. Each Holder of Registrable Securities outstanding at the time of any such amendment, waiver or consent or thereafter shall be bound by any amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to this  _Section 7(c)_, whether or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment, waiver or consent appears on the Registrable Securities or is delivered to such Holder. Waiver by any party of any breach in accordance with this _Section 7(c)_ or failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement by another party shall not be construed as, or constitute, a continuing wavier of such provisions, or a waiver of any other breach of or failure to comply with any other provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile transmission) and shall be effective (a) when delivered, (b) when transmitted via telecopy (or other facsimile device) to the number set out below if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), (c) the day following the day on which the same has been delivered prepaid to a reputable national overnight air courier service or (d) the third Business Day following the day on which the same is sent by certified or registered mail or by overnight courier, postage prepaid, in each case to the respective parties at the address set forth below, or at such other address as such party may specify by written notice to the other party hereto:

 (e) Any Holder of Registrable Securities shall be entitled to assign all or any part of its rights hereunder to any person in connection with any transfer to such person of Registrable Securities permitted by Law and the Investor Agreement and upon any such assignment and transfer such person shall be entitled to receive the benefits so assigned, and shall be bound by the terms and provisions of, this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such assignment of rights hereunder may be made if it would result in their being more than four Holders (treating any Holder and its Affiliates collectively as one Holders). Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall not be assignable or transferable and there shall be no third party beneficiaries hereto. All the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the legal successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto and any Holder. 

  

 (f) This Agreement may be executed by the parties in any number of separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 (g) The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. 

  

 (h) In any action or proceeding related to or arising out of the enforcement of, or defense against, any provision of this Agreement, the non-prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall pay, and the prevailing party shall be entitled to, all reasonable out-of-pocket 

   ##### 

  

    

costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of the prevailing
party incurred in connection with such action or proceeding. 

  

 (i) The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provisions of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or entity or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (i) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable the intent of such provision and (ii) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons, entities or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 (j) The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other provisions set forth in this Agreement or made pursuant hereto shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Electing Holder, any director, officer or partner of such Electing Holder, any agent or underwriter, any director, officer or partner of such agent or underwriter, or any controlling person of any of the foregoing, and shall survive the transfer and registration of the Applicable Securities of such Holder. 

  

 (k) This Agreement has been negotiated by the parties and their respective counsel in good faith and will be fairly interpreted in accordance with its terms and without any strict construction in favor of or against any party. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. 

  

 (l) Each party hereby acknowledges and agrees that because the obligations undertaken by them hereunder are unique and the breach of any such obligations would cause irreparable harm and significant injury that would be difficult to ascertain and would not be adequately compensable by damages alone, each party will have the right to enforce such provisions by injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies the enforcing party may have. 

  

 (m) Harris agrees that a majority of the Class A Directors (as defined in the Investor Agreement) shall have the sole and exclusive right to direct the exercise and enforcement of all rights of the Company hereunder.

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, in connection with the combination of Harris Microwave Communications Division with Stratex Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Stratex_ " or the " _Company_ "), Harris and Stratex have entered into a Formation, Contribution and Merger Agreement, dated as of September 5, 2006 (the " _Formation Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Company was formed to acquire Stratex pursuant to the Merger (as defined in the Formation Agreement) and to receive the Contributed Assets (as defined in the Formation Agreement) from Harris in the Contribution Transaction (as defined in the Formation Agreement), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Formation Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, Harris and Stratex would not have entered into the Formation Agreement without the undertakings contained in this Agreement and the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition to closing under the Formation Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants in the Agreement the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 
  _DEFINITIONS_  

   

 1.01 _Definitions_. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, any term used but not expressly defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Formation Agreement. " _Affiliate_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term by Rule 405 under the Securities Act; _provided, however_ , that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be an Affiliate of Harris or any of its other Subsidiaries. 

  

ARTICLE 2 
  _ASSIGNMENT AND LICENSE BACK OF TRADE SECRETS_  

   

 2.01 _Assignment of Contributed Trade Secrets_. Subject to the licenses granted back to Harris and its Subsidiaries pursuant to _Section 2.02_ and to any and all pre-existing licenses granted by Harris or its Subsidiaries, Harris and its Subsidiaries hereby irrevocably transfer and assign to the Company, all of their present worldwide right, title and interest in and to the Trade Secrets included in the Contributed Intellectual Property together with all Copyrights that are also Contributed Intellectual Property, along with all rights to sue and recover for any past infringements thereof (collectively, (" _Contributed Trade Secrets_ "). 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.02 _License Back to Harris and its Subsidiaries_. In consideration for the transfer and assignment of the Contributed Trade Secrets by Harris and its Subsidiaries to the Company pursuant to _Section 2.01_, the Company grants to Harris and its Subsidiaries a personal, nonexclusive, non-transferable (except as provided in _Article 7_), irrevocable (subject to  _Article 6_), worldwide, fully paid-up license to use, copy, execute and perform, and to display and distribute (subject to confidentiality provisions at least as restrictive as those contained in _Section 9.02(c)_ and _Section 9.02(d)_), the Contributed Trade Secrets, and to create, use, copy, execute and perform, and to display and distribute (subject to confidentiality provisions at least as restrictive as those contained in _Section 9.02(c)_ and _Section 9.02(d)_), derivative works from the Contributed Trade Secrets. 

  

 2.03 _Sublicenses of Contributed Trade Secrets_. The grant to Harris and its Subsidiaries from the Company in _Section 2.02_ shall include a personal, non-transferable (except as provided in _Article 7_) and nonexclusive right to communicate portions of and grant nonexclusive sublicenses (subject to confidentiality provisions at least as restrictive as those contained in _Section 9.02(c)_ and _Section 9.02(d)_) to such Contributed Trade Secrets to customers, suppliers, sublicensees or other third parties as necessary with respect to any products or services sold by Harris or its Subsidiaries now or in the future. 

  

 2.04 _Delivery of Contributed Trade Secrets_. In the event that any Contributed Trade Secret is not already in the possession of the MCD Business or MCD Employees transferred to the Company, Harris agrees to deliver to the Company, within a commercially reasonable amount of time, any missing parts of the Contributed Trade Secrets, to the extent such Contributed Trade Secrets are available and can be so transferred. 

  

 2.05 _Retained Copies of Contributed Trade Secrets_. To the knowledge of Harris, Harris has attempted to retain adequate copies of the Contributed Trade Secrets. However, the parties hereto recognize that the best or only available copy of certain Contributed Trade Secrets may reside, prior to or after the Closing Date, within the MCD Business, and that Harris may require certain access to or copies of the Contributed Trade Secrets.Accordingly, the Company agrees, upon receiving a reasonable written request from Harris, to make a good faith effort to locate and provide, to the extent such Contributed Trade Secret is available, within a commercially reasonable amount of time after receipt of Harris or its Subsidiarys written request, copies of all or any portion of the Contributed Trade Secrets. 

  

ARTICLE 3 
  _LICENSES TO TRADE SECRETS_  

   

 3.01 _Trade Secrets Licensed to the Company_. Harris and its Subsidiaries grant to the Company a fully paid-up, worldwide, irrevocable (subject to _Article 6_), non-transferable (except as provided in _Article 7_) and nonexclusive (subject to _Section 3.02_) license, subject to any and all pre-existing licenses granted by Harris, to use any Trade Secrets owned by Harris that are not Contributed Trade Secrets, but are otherwise used in connection with the design, development, repair, manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, lease, importation or other distribution of products or services of the MCD Business immediately prior to the Closing together with all Copyrights (collectively, the " _Licensed Trade Secrets_ "). 

   ##### 

  

  

 3.02 _Right to Sublicense Licensed Trade Secrets_. Subject to any and all pre-existing licenses granted by Harris or its Subsidiaries, Harris and its Subsidiaries grant to the Company a personal, non-transferable (except as provided in _Article 7_) and nonexclusive right to communicate portions of and grant nonexclusive sublicenses (subject to confidentiality provisions at least as restrictive as those in _Section 9_) to the Licensed Trade Secrets in connection with the operation of the MCD Business or any products or services sold by the Company now or in the future to suppliers to the extent necessary to produce products or components for such products for the Company and to customers to the extent necessary to permit such customers to use any product or service produced or provided by the Company for its intended purpose. The Company may not under any circumstances grant sublicenses of such rights in connection with a general licensing program, for settlement purposes or other purposes not directly related to its own operations. 

  

 3.03 _Retained Copies of Licensed Trade Secrets_. To the knowledge of Harris, Harris has attempted to retain adequate copies of the Licensed Trade Secrets. However, the parties recognize that the best or only available copy of certain Licensed Trade Secrets may reside, after the Closing Date, within the MCD Business or the businesses retained by Harris following the Closing, and Harris or the Company may require certain access to or copies of the Licensed Trade Secrets. Accordingly, the Company and Harris each agree, upon receiving a reasonable written request from the other party, to make a good faith effort to locate and provide, to the extent such Licensed Trade Secrets is available, within a commercially reasonable amount of time after receipt of the other partys written request, copies of all or any portion of the Licensed Trade Secrets reasonably deemed necessary by such other party. 

  

ARTICLE 4

 4.01 _Assignment of Contributed Patents_. Subject to the licenses granted back to Harris and its Subsidiaries pursuant to _Section 4.03_ and to any and all pre-existing licenses granted by Harris or its Subsidiaries, Harris and its Subsidiaries hereby assign and transfer to the Company all of their right, title and interest in and to the contributed patents listed in _Schedule A_, along with all rights to sue and recover for any past infringements thereof (collectively, the " _Contributed Patents_ "). 

  

 4.02 _Patents Licensed to the Company_. Harris and its Subsidiaries hereby grant to the Company a personal, fully paid-up, worldwide, non-transferable (except as provided in _Article 7_ ), irrevocable (subject to _Article 6_) and nonexclusive license under the Licensed Patents, subject to any and all pre-existing licenses granted by Harris or its Subsidiaries, to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, lease, transfer, import, export or otherwise distribute products or services of the Company now or in the future and to use and perform all processes and methods claimed by the Licensed Patents. The licenses in this _Section 4.02_ include the right to convey to any customer of the Company, with respect to any product which is sold or leased by the Company to such customer, rights to use and resell such products as sold or leased by the Company. " _Licensed Patents_ " shall mean those Patents, other than Patents which are part of the Contributed Intellectual Property ( _i.e._ , the " _Contributed Patents_ "), which Harris or its Subsidiaries own or control as of the Closing Date, which are used in the MCD Business immediately prior to the Closing, and for which Harris or its Subsidiaries have the right to grant 

   ##### 

  

    

licenses hereunder without the payment of royalties (other than to an inventor
thereof), loss of rights or imposition of a penalty. 

  

 4.03 _License Back to Harris and its Subsidiaries_. The Company hereby grants to Harris and its Subsidiaries a personal, fully paid-up, worldwide, non-transferable (except as provided in  _Article 7_), irrevocable (subject to _Article 6_) and nonexclusive license under the Contributed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, lease, transfer, import, export or otherwise distribute products or services sold by Harris or its Subsidiaries now or in the future and to use and perform all processes and methods claimed by the Contributed Patents.

 4.04 _Term_. The licenses granted under _Section 4.02_ and _Section 4.03_ shall extend until the applicable patents expiration or the expiration of as much of such term as grantor has the right to grant unless otherwise terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 4.05 _Right to Sublicense Licensed Patents_. Subject to any and all pre-existing licenses granted by Harris or its Subsidiaries, Harris and its Subsidiaries grant to the Company a personal, non-transferable (except as provided in _Article 7_), irrevocable (subject to Article 6) and nonexclusive right to grant nonexclusive sublicenses under the Licensed Patents in connection with the operation of the MCD Business or any products or services sold by the Company now or in the future to suppliers to the extent necessary to produce products or components for such products for the Company and to customers to the extent necessary to permit such customers to use any product or service produced or provided by the Company for its intended purpose. The Company may not under any circumstances grant sublicenses of such rights in connection with a general licensing program, for settlement purposes or other purposes not directly related to its own operations. 

  

 4.06 _No Sham_. The "have made" rights granted hereunder to a party do not extend or give rights to such party which would effectively create a sublicense to a third party for the patents licensed hereunder and not for bona fide business purposes of the ordinary operations of such party.

 5.01 The parties acknowledge that any information and software (including, but not limited to, services and training) provided under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export laws and regulations and export of such information and software must be authorized under those regulations.

the Formation Agreement.

measures.  
   

  

Harris acknowledges that _Sections 9.02(d)(i)_, _(iii)_ and _(iv)_ will not
apply with respect to the Contributed Trade Secrets by virtue of Harris, and
its Subsidiaries, or employees or contractors thereof having been involved

 (e) It is understood that Licensee may contest and defend any claims, proceedings, hearings or demands made against Licensee or any of its Subsidiaries by a third party challenging its use of the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name but only to the extent that such claim, proceeding, hearing or demand seeks a monetary recovery from Licensee or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 8. _Compliance, Etc_. 

  

 (a) Licensee and its Subsidiaries agree to comply with any reasonable trademark and trade name usage guidelines provided by Licensor to Licensee, as may be established from time to time by Licensor, with respect to the appearance and manner of use of the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark and Licensed Trade Name. Each time Licensee or its Subsidiaries intend to use any form of the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name not permitted by such usage guidelines, Licensee or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall submit such form to Licensor for its prior written approval, notwithstanding any previous use by Licensee or its Subsidiaries of such form of the Licensed Trademark, the 

   ##### 

  

    

Stylized Mark or Licensed Trade Name. Unless Licensor objects or denies
approval for such use within thirty (30) Business Days of actual receipt of
notice of such use by Licensee (which notice shall reference this section),
such use shall be deemed approved by Licensor; _provided_ that the Licensor
can by written notice to Licensee (specifying reasonable grounds for such
notice) later object to any subsequent use of the Licensed Trademark, the
Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name in such a manner and Licensee or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall cease such use of the Licensed
Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name as soon as
reasonably practicable following the receipt of such notice. Representative
specimens showing the use of the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark and/or
the Licensed Trade Name by Licensee and its Subsidiaries shall be sent to
Licensor from time to time upon its reasonable request. 

  

 (b) Licensee and its Subsidiaries acknowledge that the rights of Licensor in the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark and the Licensed Trade Name are paramount to any right hereby granted to Licensee and its Subsidiaries, and Licensee and its Subsidiaries agree that they will comply in all material respects with all trademark laws and regulations of all countries where the Licensee Business Products are marketed or sold or the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name is used by Licensee and its Subsidiaries. Should Licensees and its Subsidiaries compliance with the laws or regulations of any country result in the potential dilution or loss of trade name or trademark rights of Licensor in the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name, Licensee and its Subsidiaries shall take such actions as may be reasonably required by Licensor from time to time to preserve the validity and the strength of the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark and/or the Licensed Trade Name. 

  

 (c) At the reasonable request of Licensor, Licensee and its Subsidiaries agree to promptly provide to Licensor a list of countries in which Licensee and its Subsidiaries intend to market or sell the Licensee Business Products during the term of this Agreement or otherwise conduct business using the Licensed Trade Name. Licensee and its Subsidiaries, at Licensors expense, shall cooperate in assisting Licensor with filing or registering this Agreement (or relevant portions thereof) in countries requiring the same, _provided_ that if such filing requirement results solely from Licensees or its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates use of the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or Licensed Trade Name, then Licensee shall be responsible for all expenses associated with complying with such filing requirement. 

  

 9. _Quality Control_. To protect the value of the Licensed Trademark and the Stylized Mark, Licensee and its Subsidiaries agree that, during the term of this Agreement and for so long as Licensee or any of its Subsidiaries is using the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name, the Licensee Business Products manufactured, marketed and/or sold by Licensee and its Subsidiaries will be substantially equivalent, at a minimum, in quality to the Licensee Business Products presently being manufactured and sold by the Licensor as of the Closing Date with respect to materials, workmanship, and performance. Licensee and its Subsidiaries shall not use the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name in any manner which might reasonably be expected to tarnish, disparage or reflect adversely on Licensor or any of its Affiliates or the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name. Licensee and its Subsidiaries shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations in the manufacture, sale, distribution and marketing of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Licensee Business Products, Existing Packaging, New Packaging, Existing
Marketing and Promotional Material, and New Marketing and Promotional
Material bearing the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed
Trade Name, and Licensee and its Subsidiaries shall use all legends, notices,
and markings as required by applicable law. Licensor reserves the right
to inspect the quality of the Licensee Business Products manufactured, sold,
leased, distributed or marketed by Licensee and its Subsidiaries under the
Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name in order to
ensure that the quality is as aforesaid and for the purpose of maintaining in
full force and effect Licensors rights to and in the Licensed Trademark,
the Stylized Mark and the Licensed Trade Name under applicable laws. From
time to time, and at Licensors expense, Licensor may send representatives to
the plants of Licensee and its Subsidiaries (or their contract manufacturers)
to consult with and advise Licensee and its Subsidiaries with respect to
Licensees and its Subsidiaries quality control of the Licensee Business
Products; _provided_ that Licensor shall provide Licensee with five (5)
Business Days prior written notice of such visits, that such visits shall be
conducted during Licensees normal business hours and in a manner so as not
to disrupt Licensees business operations, and Licensors representatives
agree to a reasonable confidentiality agreement provided by Licensee and to
comply with Licensees (or its contract manufacturers) then-current security
practices and procedures on each visit. In response to any reasonable request
by Licensor, Licensee and its Subsidiaries shall, from time to time, at
Licensors option, send to Licensor one or more of the following: (i) copies
of Licensees and its Subsidiaries quality assurance tests, or
equivalents, conducted on the Licensee Business Products, (ii) representative
samples of the Licensee Business Products (free of cost and at the expense of
Licensee) or (iii) a written certification that all Licensee Business
Products sold by Licensee or any of its Subsidiaries during the relevant
period have been at least equivalent in quality to the Licensee Business
Products presently being manufactured and sold by Licensor immediately prior
to the Closing with regard to material, workmanship and performance. Nothing
in this agreement shall prohibit Licensor from acquiring Licensee Business
Products independently or otherwise independently verifying Licensees or
its Subsidiaries adherence to the quality standards set forth in this
Section 9.

 15. _Injunction_. The parties agree that each party shall have the right to a claim for injunctive relief in the event of any repudiation or breach or attempted repudiation or breach, of any term or condition hereunder, and acknowledge that for any such claim, a remedy at law may be inadequate. 

  

 16. _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not in any way limit or otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 17. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Licensor has the right to assign this Agreement to any subsequent owner of the Licensed Trademark, the Stylized Mark or the Licensed Trade Name, _provided_  that such assignee agrees in writing to be bound to Licensee by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by and against the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

together with the non-exclusive right with Landlord and other occupants of the

the Property, the zoning, streets, sidewalks, parking areas, curbs and access
ways adjoining it, visible easements, any surface conditions and the present
uses, and the fixtures and furniture currently installed or located in the
Premises, and Tenant accepts them in the condition in which they now are,

Tenant and its agents shall have the right, at Tenants own risk, expense and
responsibility, at all reasonable times prior to the Commencement Date, to
enter the Premises for the purpose of taking measurements and installing its
furnishings and equipment; provided that the Premises are vacant and
Tenant obtains Landlords prior written consent. 

  

4\. _Use; Compliance._  

   

 (a) Permitted Use. Tenant shall occupy and use the Premises for and only for the Use specified in Section 1(d) above and in such manner as is lawful, reputable, and will not create any nuisance or otherwise interfere with any other tenants normal operations or the management of the Building. Without limiting the foregoing, such Use shall exclude any use that would cause the Premises or the Property to be deemed a "place of public accommodation" under the Americans with Disability Act (the "ADA") as further described in the Building Rules (defined below). All Common Areas shall be subject to Landlords exclusive control and management at all times. Tenant shall not use or permit the use of any portion of the Common Areas for other than their intended use. 

   

 (b) Compliance. From and after the Commencement Date, Tenant shall comply promptly, at its sole expense, with all laws (including the ADA), ordinances, notices, orders, rules, regulations and requirements regulating the Property during the Term which impose any duty upon Landlord or Tenant with respect to use, occupancy of, or Tenants installations in or upon, the Property including the Premises, (as the same may be amended by Landlord from time to time, the "Building Rules"). Tenant shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for the cost of any alterations or improvements to the Property required by applicable law (including the ADA), ordinances, notices, orders, rules, regulations and requirements ("Required Alterations") which arise by virtue of any alterations made by Tenant or its employees, agents, contractors, licensees or invitees ("Agents") or by any Use by Tenant or its Agents other than specified in Section 1(d) above.

Tenant shall deliver to Landlord copies of all Material Safety Data Sheets or other written information prepared by manufacturers, importers or suppliers of any entity regulating any Restricted Activities. 

   

 (d) Notice. If at any time during or after the Term, Tenant becomes aware of any inquiry, investigation or proceeding regarding the Restricted Activities or becomes aware of any claims, actions or investigations regarding the ADA, Tenant shall give Landlord written notice, within 5 days after first learning thereof, providing all available information and copies of any notices. 

    ##### 

  

     

5\. _Term and Termination_. 

   

 (a) The Initial Term of this Lease shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall end at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the Initial Term (the "Expiration Date"), without the necessity for notice from either party, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms hereof. Tenant shall confirm the Commencement Date and Expiration Date by executing a lease commencement certificate in the form attached as _Exhibit "B"_. In addition to the Initial Term, Tenant will have two (2) one-year options to renew this Lease ("Extended Term"). Tenant may exercise each option to renew the lease for an additional year provided Landlord and Tenant have agreed to the Annual Rental Rate for the option year being exercised. The parties to this Lease have agreed that the Annual Rental Rate for any option year shall in no event be less than one hundred and three (103%) percent of the prior Annual Rental Rate. In the event the parties are unable to agree to the Annual Rental Rate, then the lease shall not be renewed. Landlord shall have no responsibility or liability to Tenant in the event the parties are unable to agree to the Annual Rental Rate for each option year. Any and all exercises of an option shall be in writing given by Tenant at least ninety (90) days prior to the then-current expiration date, and a writing setting forth the agreed Annual Rental Rate applicable to any Extended Term shall be executed by both Parties and incorporated into this Lease as an amendment thereto. 

   

 (b) Tenant shall have the option of termination this Lease at any time upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to Landlord provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Tenant shall pay, as an early termination fee and not as a penalty, (x) if such termination occurs during the first year of the Term one (1) full years Rent, and (y) if such termination occurs thereafter, the lesser of (i) six (6) months Rent and (ii) the Rent for the then-remaining Term of this Lease. 

  

6\. _Annual Rent_. Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord the Annual Rent in equal
monthly installments in the amount set forth in _Section 1(c) _(as increased
at the beginning of each option lease year as set forth in _Section 1(c)_,
in advance, on the first day of each calendar month during the Term, without
notice, designates otherwise, provided that rent for the first full month
shall be paid at the signing of this Lease. If the Commencement Date falls on
a day other than the first day of a calendar month, the rent shall be
apportioned pro rata on a per diem basis for the period from the Commencement
Date until the first day of the following calendar month and shall be paid
on or before the Commencement Date. As used in this Lease, the term "lease
year" for any option year means the period from the anniversary of the
Commencement Date if it falls on the first day of a calendar month and of the
first day of the succeeding calendar month if it does not through
the succeeding 12 full calendar months. This Lease as stated above is for an
initial lease period of two (2) years plus any partial month between the
Commencement Date and the first day of the next succeeding calendar month.
For each exercisable Extended Term, the lease year shall mean the successive
12 month period thereafter. 

   

7\. _Operation of Property; Expenses_. 

   

 (a) Payment of Operating Expenses. Included in the Annual Rental Rate are the expenses for operating and maintaining the Premises which costs may include by way of example rather than limitation: insurance premiums, fees, impositions, maintenance, service contracts, management and administrative fees, governmental permits, overhead expenses, costs of furnishing water, sewer, gas, fuel, electricity, other utility services, janitorial service, trash removal, security services, landscaping and grounds maintenance, and the cost of any other items attributable to operating or maintaining any or all of the Property excluding any costs which under generally accepted accounting principles are capital expenditures; provided, however, that annual operating costs also shall include the annual amortization (over an assumed useful life of ten years) of the costs (including financing charges) of building improvements made by Landlord to the Property after the Commencement Date that are required by any governmental authority or for the purpose of reducing operating expenses or directly enhancing the safety   ##### 

  

  

  

of tenants in the Building generally. Items specifically not included in the
expenses for operating the Property shall be associated with operating each
of these examples. Such expenses shall be the responsibility of Tenant,
separate and apart from the amount owed Landlord under this Agreement.
Landlord agrees to make access to telecommunications services available, to
the same extent as they are at the Commencement Date of this Lease, however
the cost of such service are in addition to the Annual Rental Rate and is
borne by the Tenant. 

   

 (b) Impositions. As used in this Lease "impositions" refer to all levies, taxes (including sales taxes and gross receipt taxes) and assessments, which are applicable to the Term, and which are imposed by any authority or under any law, ordinance or regulation thereof, or pursuant to any recorded covenants or agreements, and the reasonable cost of contesting any of the foregoing, upon or with respect to the Property or any part thereof, or any improvements thereto. Florida Statutes §212.031 requires a sales tax on monthly rental. Such tax is currently six percent (6%) of the monthly rental amount. Tenant shall pay to Landlord with the monthly payment of Rent any imposition imposed directly upon this Lease or the Rent (defined in _Section 7(g)_) or amounts payable by any subtenants or other occupants of the Premises, or against Landlord because of Landlords estate or interest herein. 

   

 (i) Nothing herein contained shall be interpreted as requiring Tenant to pay any income, excess profits or corporate stock tax imposed or assessed upon Landlord. 

  

 (ii) If it shall not be lawful for Tenant to reimburse Landlord for any of the impositions, the Annual Rent shall be increased by the amount of the portion of such imposition allocable to Tenant, unless prohibited by law. 

  

 (c) Insurance. 

   

 (i) Property. Landlord shall keep in effect insurance against loss or damage to the Building or the Property by fire and such other casualties as may be included within fire, extended coverage and special form insurance covering the full replacement cost of the Building (but excluding coverage of Tenants personal property in, and any alterations by Tenant to, the Premises), and such other insurance as Landlord may reasonably deem appropriate or as may be required from time-to-time by any mortgagee. 

  

 (ii) Liability. Tenant, at its own expense, shall keep in effect comprehensive general public liability insurance with respect to the Premises and the Property, including contractual liability insurance, with such limits of liability for bodily injury (including death) and property damage as $1,000,000 per occurrence and a general aggregate limit of not less than $2,000,000 (which aggregate shall not limit the liability of Tenant hereunder. The policy of comprehensive general public liability insurance also shall name Landlord and Landlords agent as additional insured parties with respect to the Premises, shall be written on an "occurrence" basis and not on a "claims made" basis, shall provide that it is primary with respect to any policies carried by Landlord and that any coverage carried by Landlord shall be excess insurance, shall provide that it shall not be cancelable or reduced without at least 30 days prior written notice to Landlord and shall be issued in form satisfactory to Landlord. The insurer shall be a responsible insurance carrier which is authorized to issue such insurance and licensed to do business in the state in which the Property is located and which has at all times during the Term a rating of no less than A VII in the most current edition of _Best s Insurance Reports_. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord on or before the Commencement Date, and subsequently renewals of, a certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage and the waiver of subrogation described below. 

  

 (iii) Waiver of Subrogation. Landlord and Tenant shall have included in their respective property insurance policies waivers of their respective insurers right of subrogation 

   ##### 

  

 

against the other party. If such a waiver should be unobtainable or
unenforceable, then such policies of insurance shall state expressly that
such policies shall not be invalidated if, before a casualty, the insured
waives the right of recovery against any party responsible for a
casualty covered by the policy. 

   

 (iv) Increase of Premiums. Tenant agrees not to do anything or fail to do anything which will increase the cost of Landlords insurance or which will prevent Landlord from procuring policies (including public liability) from companies and in form satisfactory to Landlord. If any breach of the preceding sentence by Tenant causes the rate of fire or other insurance to be increased, Tenant shall pay the amount of such increase as additional rent promptly upon being billed. 

  

 (d) Repairs and Maintenance; Common Areas; Building Management. 

   

 (i) Tenant at its sole expense shall maintain the Premises in a neat and orderly condition. 

  

 (ii) Landlord shall make available to Tenant Common Areas generally made available to other tenants. "Common Areas " means all areas and facilities outside the Premises and within the exterior boundary line of the Property that are designated by Landlord from time to time for the general non-exclusive use of Landlord, Tenant and other tenants of the Property and their respective employees, suppliers, customers and invitees, including, but not limited to, common entrances, lobbies, corridors, stairwells, public restrooms, cafeterias, elevators, parking areas, roadways and sidewalks located in Building C. Tenants shall request Landlords prior written consent to use or occupy any other area located on Campus. As used herein, the term "Campus" shall mean the buildings and surrounding areas located in close proximity of the Premises and generally used and occupied by Landlord. 

  

 (iii) Landlord shall make all necessary repairs to the Premises, the Common Areas and any other improvements located on the Property, provided that Landlord shall have no responsibility to make any repair until Landlord receives written notice of the need for such repair. Landlord shall operate and manage the Property and shall maintain all Common Areas and any paved area appurtenant to the Property in a clean and orderly condition. Landlord reserves the right to make alterations to the Common Area from time to time. 

  

 (iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Landlord shall not bear the expense of any repairs and replacements to the Property including the Premise requested by and for the Tenants use, occupancy or alteration of, or made at the sole expense of Tenant to the extent not covered by any applicable insurance proceeds to Landlord. Tenant shall not bear the expense of any repairs or replacements to the Property arising out of or caused by Landlords or any other tenants use, occupancy or alteration of, or any other tenants installation in or upon, the Property or by any act or omission of any other tenant or any other tenants Agents. 

  

 (e) Utilities. 

   

 (i) Landlord will furnish the Premises with electricity, heating and air conditioning for the normal use and occupancy of the Premises as general offices between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., Monday through Friday (legal holidays excepted). If Tenant shall require electricity or install electrical equipment including but not limited to electrical heating, refrigeration equipment, electronic data processing machines, or machines or equipment using current in excess of 110 volts, which will in any way increase the amount of electricity usually furnished for use as general office space, or if Tenant shall attempt to use the Premises in such a manner that the services to be furnished by Landlord would be required during periods other than or in addition to business hours referred to above, Tenant will obtain Landlords prior written approval and will pay for the resulting additional direct expense, including the expense resulting from the installation of such equipment and meters, as additional rent promptly upon being billed. Landlord shall not be responsible or liable for any interruption in utility service, nor shall such interruption affect the continuation or validity of the lease. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) If at any time utility services supplied to the Premises are separately metered, the cost of installing Tenants meter and the cost of such separately metered utility service shall be paid by Tenant promptly upon being billed. 

  

 (f) Janitorial Services. Landlord will provide Tenant with trash removal and janitorial services five (5) days a week, Monday through Friday. 

   

 (g) "Rent." The term "Rent" as used in this Lease means the Annual Rent (which includes the Operating Expenses), Florida Taxes (see paragraph 7(b) herein) and any other additional rent or sums payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to this Lease, all of which shall be deemed rent for purposes of Landlords rights and remedies with respect thereto. Tenant shall pay all Rent to Landlord within 30 days after Tenant is billed, unless otherwise provided in this Lease, and interest shall accrue on all sums due but unpaid. 

  

8\. _Signs_. Landlord, at Tenants expense, will place Tenants name and suite
number on the Building standard sign and on or beside the entrance door to
the Premises. Except for signs which are located wholly within the interior
of the Premises and not visible from the exterior of the Premises, no signs
shall be placed on the Property without the prior written consent of
Landlord. All signs installed by Tenant shall be maintained by Tenant in good
condition and Tenant shall remove all such signs at the termination of this
Lease and shall repair any damage caused by such installation, existence or
removal. 

   

9\. _Alterations and Fixtures_. 

   

 (a) Subject to _Section 10_, Tenant shall have the right to install its trade fixtures in the Premises, provided that no such installation or removal thereof shall affect any structural portion of the Property nor any utility lines, communications lines, equipment or facilities in the Building serving any tenant other than Tenant. At the expiration or termination of this Lease or any Extended Term, at the option of Landlord or Tenant, Tenant shall remove such installation(s) and, in the event of such removal, Tenant shall repair any damage caused by such installation or removal; if Tenant, with Landlords written consent, elects not to remove such installation(s) at the expiration or termination of this Lease, all such installation shall remain on the Property and become the property of Landlord without payment by Landlord. 

   

 (b) Except for non-structural changes which do not exceed $5,000 in the aggregate, Tenant shall not make or permit to be made any alterations to the Premises without Landlords prior written consent. Tenant shall pay the costs of any required architectural/engineering reviews. In making any alterations, (i) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord the plans, specifications and necessary permits, together with certificates evidencing that Tenants contractors and subcontractors have adequate insurance coverage naming Landlord and Landlords agent as additional insureds, at least 10 (ten) days prior to commencement thereof, (ii) such alterations shall not impair the structural strength of the Building or any other improvements or reduce the value of the Property or affect any utility lines, communications lines, equipment or facilities in the Building serving any tenant other than Tenant, (iii) Tenant shall comply with Section 10 and (iv) the occupants of the Building and of any adjoining property shall not be disturbed thereby. All alterations to the Premises by Tenant shall be the property of Tenant until the expiration or termination of this Lease; at that time all such alterations shall remain on the Property and become the property of Landlord without payment by Landlord unless Landlord gives written notice to Tenant to remove the same, in which event Tenant will remove such alterations and repair any resulting damage. At Tenants request prior to Tenant making any alterations, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing, whether Tenant is required to remove such alterations at the expiration or termination of this Lease. 

    ##### 

  

    

10\. _Mechanics  Liens._ Tenant shall not suffer any mechanics lien to be
filed against the Premises by reason of work, labor, services or materials
performed or furnished to Tenant or anyone holding the Premises, or any part
hereof, through or under Tenant. If any mechanics lien or any notice of
intention to file a mechanics lien shall at any time be filed against the
Premises, Tenant shall at Tenants cost, within fourteen (14) days after
knowledge or notice of the filing of any mechanics lien, cause the same to
be removed or discharged of record by payment, bond, order of a court of
competent jurisdiction, or otherwise. 

  

If Tenant shall fail to remove or discharge any mechanics lien or any notice
of intention to file a mechanics lien within the prescribed time, then in
addition to any other right or remedy of Landlord, Landlord may, at its
option, procure the removal or discharge of the same by payment or bond or
otherwise. Any amount paid by Landlord for such purpose, together with all
legal and other expenses of Landlord in procuring the removal or discharge or
such lien or notice of intention and together with interest thereon at the
highest permissible rate, shall be and become due and payable by Tenant to
Landlord as additional rent, and in the event of Tenants failure to pay
therefor within fifteen (15) days after demand, the same shall be added to
and be due and payable with the next months rent. 

  

Nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed as consent on the part of
Landlord to subject Landlords estate in the Premises to any lien or
liability arising out of Tenants use or occupancy of the premises. 

   

11\. _Landlord s Right to Relocate Tenant; Right of Entry. _ 

   

 (a) Landlord may cause Tenant to relocate from the Premises to a comparable space ("Relocation Space") within the Building or within a five (5) mile radius of the Building by giving written notice to Tenant at least sixty (60) days in advance, provided that Landlord shall pay for all reasonable costs of such relocation. Such relocation shall not terminate, modify or otherwise affect this Lease except that "Premises" shall refer to the Relocation Space rather than the location identified in _Section 1(a) _and the Rent shall be proportionately reduced if the net usable area in the Relocation Space is smaller than that of the Premises. 

   

 (b) Tenant shall permit Landlord and its Agents to enter the Premises at all reasonable times following reasonable notice (except in the event of an emergency) for the purpose of inspection, maintenance or making repairs, alterations or additions as well as to exhibit the Premises for the purpose of sale or mortgage and, during the last 12 months of the Term, to exhibit the Premises to any prospective tenant. Landlord will make reasonable efforts not to inconvenience Tenant in exercising the foregoing rights, but shall not be liable for any loss of occupation or quiet enjoyment thereby occasioned. 

   

 (c) Tenant shall be responsible for all costs incurred by Tenant when Tenant vacates or relocates from the leased Property or any moves made within the Property when such move is made at the sole request and convenience of Tenant. 

   

12\. _Damage by Fire or Other Casualty_. __  

   

 (a) If the Property or Building shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, Tenant promptly shall notify Landlord and Landlord, subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 12, shall repair such damage and restore the Premises to substantially the same condition in which they were immediately prior to such damage or destruction, but not including the repair, restoration or replacement   ##### 

  

  

  

of the fixtures or alterations installed by Tenant. Landlord shall notify
Tenant in writing, within 30 days after the date of the casualty, if Landlord
anticipates that the restoration will take more than 180 days from the date
of the casualty to complete; in such event, either Landlord or Tenant may
terminate this Lease effective as of the date of casualty by giving written
notice to the other within 10 days after Landlords notice. 

   

 (b) Landlord shall maintain a 12 month rental coverage endorsement or other comparable form of coverage as part of its fire extended coverage and special form insurance. Tenant will receive an abatement of its Rent to the extent the Premises are rendered untenantable as determined by the carrier providing the rental coverage endorsement. 

   

13\. _Condemnation_. __  

   

 (a) Termination. If (i) all of the Premises are taken by a condemnation or otherwise for any public or quasi-public use, (ii) any part of the Premises is so taken and the remainder thereof is insufficient for the reasonable operation of Tenants business or (iii) any of the Property is so taken, and, in Landlords opinion, it would be impractical or the condemnation proceeds are insufficient to restore the remainder of the Property, then this Lease shall terminate and all unaccrued obligations hereunder shall cease as of the day before possession is taken by the condemnor. 

   

 (b) Partial Taking. If there is a condemnation and this Lease has not been terminated pursuant to Section 13(a), (i) Landlord shall restore the Building and the improvements which are a part of the Premises to a condition and size as nearly comparable as reasonably possible to the condition and size thereof immediately prior to the date upon which the condemnor took possession and (ii) the obligations of Landlord and Tenant shall be unaffected by such condemnation except that there shall be an equitable abatement of the Rent according to the rental value of the Premises before and after the date upon which the condemnor took possession and/or the date Landlord completes such restoration. 

   

 (c) Award. In the event of a condemnation affecting Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to make a claim against the condemnor for moving expenses and business dislocation damages to the extent that such claim does not reduce the sums otherwise payable by the condemnor to Landlord. Except as aforesaid and except as set forth in (d) below, Tenant hereby assigns all claims against the condemnor to Landlord. 

   

 (d) Temporary Taking. No temporary taking of the Premises shall terminate this Lease or give Tenant any right to any rental abatement. Any award for such temporary taking during the Term shall be applied first, to Landlords costs of collection and, second, on account of sums owing to Tenant hereunder, and if such amounts applied on account of sums owing by Tenant hereunder should exceed the entire amount owing by Tenant for the remainder of the Term, the excess will be paid to Tenant. 

  

14\. _Non-Abatement of Rent._ Except as otherwise expressly provided as to
damage by fire or other casualty in _Section 12(b) _and as to condemnation
in _Section 13(b), _there shall be no abatement or reduction of the Rent for
any cause whatsoever, and this Lease shall not terminate, and Tenant shall
not be entitled to surrender the Premises. 

  

15\. _Indemnification of Landlord._ (a) Subject to _Sections 7(c)(iii) _and
_16_ , Tenant will protect, indemnify and hold harmless Landlord and its
Agents from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, liability and
expense (including fees of attorneys, investigators and experts)
in connection with loss of life, personal injury or damage to property in or
about the Premises arising out of the occupancy or use of the Premises by
Tenant or its Agents or occasioned wholly or in part by any act or omission
of Tenant or its Agents, whether prior to, during or after the Term, except
to the extent such loss, injury or   ##### 

  

   

damage was caused by the negligence of Landlord or its Agents. In case any
action or proceeding is brought against Landlord and/or its Agents by reason
of the foregoing, Tenant, at its expense, shall resist and defend such action
or proceeding, or cause the same to be resisted and defended by counsel
(reasonably acceptable to Landlord and its Agents) designated by the insurer
whose policy covers such occurrence or by counsel designated by Tenant and
approved by Landlord and its Agents. Tenants obligations pursuant to this
_Section 15 _shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease. 

   

 (b) Landlord shall indemnify and hold harmless Tenant, its agents and employees from any and all damages, claims, causes of action, fines, penalties, losses, liabilities, judgment and expenses directly incurred as a result of (i) claims advanced by third persons and arising out of Landlords, its employees, or agents sole negligence, which is, in any manner connected with the use, ownership or occupancy of the property herein; (ii) claims arising from any loss occurring within the Common Area of the Premises, of which Tenant has either no control under the terms of the Lease or where none of Tenants actions or the actions of its employees, agents or invitees contributed to such claim. 

  

16\. _Waiver of Claims._ Landlord and Tenant each hereby waives all claims for
recovery against the other for any loss or damage which may be inflicted upon
the property of such party even if such loss or damage shall be brought about
by the fault or negligence of the other party or its Agents; provided,
however, that such waiver by Landlord shall not be effective with respect
to any liability of Tenant described in 
 _Sections 4(c) and 7(d) (iii)._ 

  

17\. _Quiet Enjoyment_. Landlord covenants that Tenant, upon performing all of
its covenants, agreements and conditions of this Lease, shall have quiet and
peaceful possession of the Premises as against anyone claiming by or through
Landlord, subject, however, to the exceptions, reservations and conditions of
this Lease. 

   

18\. _Assignment and Subletting._  

   

 (a) Limitation. Tenant shall not transfer this Lease, voluntarily, involuntarily, or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Landlord. Any attempted transfer shall be null and void at the option of Landlord, and Landlord may exercise any or all of its rights under  _Section 23\. _A consent to one transfer shall not be deemed to be a consent to any subsequent transfer. The term "transfer" shall include any sublease, assignment, license or concession agreement, change in ownership or control of Tenant (other than any such change resulting from any action taken by Landlord in its capacity as a stockholder in Tenant or from any action taken by Tenant approved by the Board of Directors of Tenant at a time when Landlord was entitled to designate a majority of the directors of Tenant), mortgage or hypothecation of this Lease or Tenants interest therein or in all or a portion of the Premises. 

   

 (b) Offer to Landlord. Tenant acknowledges that the terms of this Lease, including the Rent, have been based on the understanding that Tenant physically shall occupy the Premises for the entire Term. Therefore, upon Tenants request to transfer all or a portion of the Premises, at the option of Landlord, Tenant and Landlord shall execute an amendment to this Lease removing such space from the Premises. Tenant shall be relieved of any liability with respect to such space and Landlord shall have the right to lease such space to any party, including Tenants proposed transferee. 

   

 (c) Conditions. Notwithstanding the above, the following shall apply to any transfer, with or without Landlords consent: 

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) As of the date of any transfer, Tenant shall not be in default under this Lease nor shall any act or omission have occurred which would constitute a default with the giving of notice and/or the passage of time. 

  

 (ii) No transfer shall relieve Tenant of its obligation to pay the Rent and to perform all its other obligations hereunder. The acceptance of Rent by Landlord from any person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease or to be a consent to any transfer. 

  

 (iii) Each transfer shall be by a written instrument in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord which shall (A) include an assumption of liability by any transferee of all Tenants obligations and the transferees ratification of and agreement to be bound by all the provisions of this Lease, (B) afford Landlord the right of direct action against the transferee pursuant to the same remedies as are available to Landlord against Tenant and (C) be executed by Tenant and the transferee. 

  

 (iv) Tenant shall pay, within 10 days of receipt of an invoice which shall be no less than  _$250,_ Landlords reasonable attorneys fees and costs in connection with the review, processing and documentation of any transfer for which Landlords consent is requested. 

  

19\. _Subordination; Mortgagee s Rights_. 

   

 (a) This Lease shall be subordinate to any first mortgage or other primary encumbrance now or hereafter affecting the Premises. Although the subordination is self-operative, within 10 days after written request, Tenant shall execute and deliver any further instruments confirming such subordination of this Lease and any further instruments of attornment that may be desired by any such mortgagee or Landlord. However, any mortgagee may at any time subordinate its mortgage to this Lease, without Tenants consent, by giving written notice to Tenant, and thereupon this Lease shall be deemed prior to such mortgage without regard to the respective dates of execution and delivery; provided, however, that such subordination shall not affect any mortgagees right of condemnation awards, casualty insurance proceeds, intervening liens or any right which shall arise between the recording of such mortgage and the execution of this Lease. 

   

 (b) It is understood and agreed that any mortgagee shall not be liable to Tenant for any funds paid by Tenant to Landlord unless such funds actually have been transferred to such mortgagee by Landlord. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 12 and 13 above, Landlords obligation to restore the Premises after a casualty or condemnation shall be subject to the consent and prior rights of Landlords first mortgagee. 

  

20\. _Recording; Tenant s Certificate_. Tenant shall not record this Lease or
a memorandum thereof without Landlords prior written consent. Within 10 days
after Landlords written request from time to time: 

   

 (a) Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord a written statement certifying the Commencement Date and Expiration Date of this Lease, that this Lease is in full force and effect and has not been modified and otherwise as set forth in the form of estoppel certificate reasonably requested by Landlord and/or such other certifications as may be requested by a mortgagee or purchaser. Tenant understands that its failure to execute such documents may cause Landlord serious financial damage by causing the failure of a financing or sale transaction. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Tenant shall furnish to Landlord, Landlords mortgagee, prospective mortgagee or purchaser reasonably requested financial information. 

   

 21. _Surrender; Abandoned Property_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms of _Section 9(b), 12(a) _and _13(b),_ at the expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenant promptly shall yield up in the same condition, order and repair in which they are required to be kept throughout the Term, including any exercised options, the Premises and any improvements thereto, and all fixtures and equipment serving the Building, ordinary wear and tear excepted. 

   

 (b) Upon or prior to the expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenant shall remove any personal property from the Property. Any personal property remaining thereafter shall be deemed conclusively to have been abandoned, and Landlord, at Tenants expense, may remove, store, sell or otherwise dispose of such property in such manner as Landlord may see fit and/or Landlord may retain such property as its property. If any part thereof shall be sold, then Landlord may receive and retain the proceeds of such sale and apply the same, at its option, against the expenses of the sale, the cost of moving and storage and any Rent due under this Lease. 

   

 (c) If Tenant, or any person claiming through Tenant, shall continue to occupy the Premises after the expiration or termination of this Lease or any renewal thereof, such occupancy shall be deemed to be under a month-to-month tenancy under the same terms and conditions set forth in this Lease, except that the Rent shall be increased 150% from the then current rate and in no event shall such month-to-month tenancy exceed two (2) months or sixty (60) days. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, any holding over by Tenant without Landlords prior written consent shall constitute a default hereunder and shall be subject to all the remedies available to Landlord. 

  

22\. _Curing Tenant s Defaults._ If Tenant shall be in default in the
performance of any of its obligations hereunder, Landlord without any
obligation to do so, in addition to any other rights it may have in law or
equity, may elect to cure such default on behalf of Tenant after written
notice (except in the case of emergency) to Tenant. Tenant shall reimburse
Landlord upon demand for any sums paid or costs incurred by Landlord in
curing such default, including interest thereon from the respective dates of
Landlord incurring such costs, which sums and costs together with interest
shall be deemed additional rent. 

   

23\. _Defaults  Remedies. _ 

   

 (a) Defaults. It shall be an event of default: 

   

 (i) If Tenant does not pay in full when due any and all Rent; 

  

 (ii) If Tenant fails to observe and perform or otherwise breaches any other provision of this Lease; 

  

 (iii) If Tenant abandons the Premises, which shall be conclusively presumed if the Tenant fails to make the Monthly Rental Payment and the Premises remain unoccupied for more than 10 consecutive days; or 

  

 (iv) If Tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt in any sense or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or offers a settlement to creditors, or if a petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or for an arrangement with creditors under any federal or state law is filed by or against 

   ##### 

  

 

Tenant, or a bill in equity or other proceeding for the appointment of a
receive for any of Tenants assets is commenced, or if any of the real or
personal property of Tenant shall be levied upon; provided, however, that any
proceeding brought by anyone other than Landlord or Tenant under any
bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law shall not constitute a
default until such proceeding has continued unstayed for more than 60
consecutive days. 

   

 (b) Remedies. Then, and in any such event, Landlord shall have the following rights: 

   

 (i) To charge a late payment fee equal to the greater of $2,000 or 5% of any amount owed to Landlord pursuant to this Lease which is not paid within 15 days after the due date; 

  

 (ii) To enter and repossess the Premises, by breaking open locked doors if necessary, and remove all persons and all or any property therefrom, by action at law or otherwise, without being liable for prosecution or damages therefor, and Landlord may at Landlords option, make alterations and repairs in order to relet the Premises and relet all or any part(s) of the Premises for Tenants account. Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord on demand any deficiency that may arise by reason of such reletting. In the event of reletting without termination of this Lease, Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for such previous breach; 

  

 (iii) To accelerate the whole or any part of the Rent for the balance of the Term, and declare the same to be immediately due and payable; 

  

 (iv) To terminate this Lease and the Term without any right on the part of Tenant to save the forfeiture by payment of any sum due or by other performance of any condition, term or covenant broken; 

  

 (v) In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Tenant of any of the covenants or provisions hereof, Landlord shall have the right of injunction and the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity as if re-entry, summary proceedings and other remedies were not herein provided for; 

  

 (vi) No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to Landlord is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy herein or by law provided but each shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right or remedy given herein or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute; or 

  

 (vii) The right to pursue the remedies herein provided against Tenant and to enforce all of the other provisions of this Lease may, at the option of any assignee of this Lease, be exercised by any assignee of the Landlords right, title and interest in this Lease in his, her or their own name, any statute, rule of court, custom, or practice to the contrary notwithstanding. 

  

 (c) Grace Period. Notwithstanding anything hereinabove stated, neither party will exercise any available right because of any default of the other, except those remedies contained in subsection (b)(i) of this Section, unless such party shall have first given 10 days written notice thereof to the defaulting party, and the defaulting party shall have failed to cure the default within such period; provided, however, that; 

   

 (i) No such notice shall be required if Tenant fails to comply with the provisions of Sections 10 or 20(a), in the case of emergency as set forth in _Section 22 _or in the event of any default enumerated in subsections (a)(iii) and (iv) of this Section. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) Landlord shall not be required to give such 10 days notice more than 2 times during any 12-month period. 

  

 (iii) If the default consists of something other than the failure to pay money which cannot reasonably be cured within 10 days, neither party will exercise any right if the defaulting party begins to cure the default within the 10 days and continues actively and diligently in good faith to completely cure said default. 

  

 (iv) Tenant agrees that any notice given by Landlord pursuant to this Section which is served in compliance with _Section 27_ shall be adequate notice for the purpose of Landlords exercise of any available remedies. 

  

 (d) Non-Waiver; Non-Exclusive. No waiver by Landlord of any breach by Tenant shall be a waiver of any subsequent breach, nor shall any forbearance by Landlord to seek a remedy for any breach by Tenant be a waiver by Landlord of any rights and remedies with respect to such or any subsequent breach. Efforts by Landlord to mitigate the damages caused by Tenants default shall not constitute a waiver of Landlords right to recover damages hereunder. No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to Landlord is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy provided herein or by law, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right or remedy given herein or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. No payment by Tenant or receipt or acceptance by Landlord of a lesser amount than the total amount due Landlord under this Lease shall be deemed to be other than on account, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlords right to recover the balance of Rent due, or Landlord right to pursue any other available remedy. 

   

 (e) Costs and Attorneys Fees. If either party commences an action against the other party arising out of or in connection with this Lease, the prevailing party shall be entitled to have and recover from the losing party attorneys fees, costs of suit, investigation expenses and discovery costs, including costs of appeal. 

  

24\. _Representations and Covenants of Tenant_. Tenant represents and
covenants to Landlord that: 

   

 (a) The word "Tenant" as used herein includes the Tenant named above as well as its successors and permitted assigns, each of which shall be under the same obligations and liabilities and each of which shall have the same rights, privileges and powers as it would have possessed had it originally signed this Lease as Tenant. Each and every of the persons named above as Tenant shall be bound jointly and severally by the terms, covenants and agreements contained herein. However, no such rights, privileges or powers shall inure to the benefit of any assignee of Tenant immediate or remote, unless Tenant has complied with the terms of Section 18 and the assignment to such assignee is permitted or has been approved in writing by Landlord. Any notice required or permitted by the terms of this Lease may be given by or to any one of the persons named above as Tenant, and shall have the same force and effect as is given by or to all thereof. 

   

 (b) If Tenant is a corporation, partnership or any other form of business association or entity, Tenant is duly formed and in good standing, and has full corporate or partnership power and authority, as the case may be, to enter into this Lease and has taken all corporate or partnership action, as the case may be, necessary to carry out the transaction contemplated herein, so that when executed, this Lease constitutes a valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms. Tenant shall provide Landlord with corporate resolutions or other proof in a form acceptable to Landlord, authorizing the execution of this Lease at the time of such execution. 

    ##### 

  

    

25\. _Liability of Landlord._ The word "Landlord" as used herein includes the
Landlord named above as well as its successors and assigns, each of which
shall have the same rights, remedies, powers, authorities and privileges as
it would have had it originally signed this Lease as Landlord. Any such
person or entity, whether or not named herein, shall have no
liability hereunder after it ceases to hold title to the Premises except for
obligations already accrued (and, as to any unapplied portion of Tenants
Security Deposit, Landlord shall be relieved of all liability therefor upon
transfer of such portion to its successor in interest) and Tenant shall look
solely to Landlords successor in interest for the performance of the
covenants and obligations of the Landlord hereunder which thereafter shall
accrue. Neither any principal of Landlord nor any owner of the Property other
than Landlord, whether disclosed or undisclosed, shall have any personal
liability with respect to any of the provisions of this Lease or the
Premises. No mortgagee or lessor succeeding to the interest of Landlord
hereunder (either in terms of ownership or possessory rights) shall be (a)
liable for any previous act or omission of a prior landlord, (b) subject to
any rental offsets or defenses against a prior landlord or (c) bound by
an amendment of this Lease made without its written consent, or by payment by
Tenant of Rent in advance in excess of one monthly installment. 

   

26\. _Interpretation; Definitions_. __  

   

 (a) Captions. The captions in this Lease are for convenience only and are not a part of this Lease and do not in any way define, limit, describe or amplify the terms and provisions of this Lease or the scope of intent thereof. 

   

 (b) Entire Agreement. This Lease represents the entire agreement between hereto and there are no collateral or oral agreements or understandings between Landlord and Tenant with respect to the Premises or the Property. No rights, easement or licenses are acquired in the Property or any land adjacent to the Property by Tenant by implication or otherwise except as expressly set forth in the provisions of this Lease. This Lease shall not be modified in any manner except by an instrument in writing executed by the parties. The masculine (or neuter) pronoun and the singular number shall include the masculine, feminine and neuter genders and the singular and plural number. The word "including" followed by any specific item(s) is deemed to refer to examples rather than to be words of limitations. Both parties having participated fully and equally in the negotiation and preparation of this Lease, this Lease shall not be more strictly construed, nor any ambiguities in this Lease resolved, against either Landlord or Tenant. 

   

 (c) Covenants. Each covenant, agreement, obligation, term, condition or other provision herein contained shall be deemed and construed as a separate and independent covenant of the party bound by, undertaking or making the same, not dependent on any other provision of this Lease unless otherwise expressly provided. All of the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease shall apply throughout the Term unless otherwise expressly set forth herein. 

   

 (d) Interest. Wherever interest is required to be paid hereunder, such interest shall be at the highest rate permitted under law but not in excess of 15% per annum. 

   

 (e) Severability; Governing Law. If any provisions of this Lease shall be declared unenforceable in any respect, such unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Lease, and each such provision shall be deemed to be modified, if possible, in such a manner as to render it enforceable and to preserve to the extent possible the intent of the parties as set forth herein. This Lease shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state in which the Property is located. 

   

 (f) "Mortgage" and "Mortgagee." The word "Mortgage" as used herein includes any lien or encumbrance on the Premises of the Property or on any part of or interest in or appurtenance to any of the foregoing, including without limitation any ground rent or ground lease if Landlords interest is or   ##### 

  

  

  

becomes a leasehold estate. The word "mortgage" as used herein includes the
holder of any mortgage, including any ground lessor if Landlords interest is
or becomes a leasehold estate. Wherever any right is given to a mortgagee
that right may be exercised on behalf of such mortgagee by any representative
or servicing agent of such mortgagee. 

   

 (g) "Person." The word "Person" is used herein to include a natural person, a partnership, a corporation, an association and any other form of business association or entity. 

  

27\. _Notices._ Any notice or other communication under this Lease shall be in
writing and addressed to Landlord or Tenant at their respective addresses
specified at the beginning of this Lease, except that after the Commencement
Date Tenants address shall be at the premises (or to such other address as
either may designate by notice to the other), with a copy to any mortgagee
or other party designated by Landlord. Each notice or other communication
shall be deemed given if sent by prepaid overnight delivery service or by
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid or in any other
manner, with delivery in any case evidenced by a receipt, and shall be deemed
received on the day of actual receipt by the intended recipient or on the
business day delivery is refused. The giving of notice by Landlords
attorneys, representatives and agents under this Section shall be deemed to
be the acts of Landlord; however, the foregoing provisions governing the date
on which a notice is deemed to have been received shall mean and refer to
the date on which a party to this Lease, and not its counsel or other
recipient to which a copy of the notice may be sent, is deemed to have
received the notice. 

  

28\. _Security Deposit._ Intentionally Deleted. 

  

29\. _Radon Gas._ Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that, when it
has accumulated in a building in sufficient quantities may present health
risks to persons who are exposed to it over time. Levels of radon that exceed
federal and state guidelines have been found in buildings in Florida.
Additional information regarding radon and radon testing may be obtained from
your county public health unit. 

    ##### 

  

     

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, and in consideration of the mutual entry into this Lease and for other good and valuable consideration and intending to be legally bound, Landlord and Tenant have executed this Lease.

 _TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT_  

   

 This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of [Closing Date] (the " _Effective Date_ "), is made by and between HARRIS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Harris_ "), and HARRIS STRATEX NETWORKS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, Harris and Stratex Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Stratex_ "), have entered into a Formation, Contribution and Merger Agreement, dated as of September 5, 2006 (the " _Formation Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Company was formed to acquire Stratex pursuant to the Merger (as defined in the Formation Agreement) and to receive the Contributed Assets (as defined in the Formation Agreement) from Harris in the Contribution Transaction (as defined in the Formation Agreement), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Formation Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, Harris and Stratex would not have entered into the Formation Agreement without the undertakings contained in this Agreement and the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition to closing under the Formation Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants in the Agreements, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 SERVICES 

   

 Section 1.01 _Definitions_. All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Formation Agreement; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Harris or any of its other Subsidiaries or Affiliates for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.02 _Provision of Services_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Harris shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide to the Company and its Affiliates, for use in connection with the MCD Business as such business is conducted by the Company following the Closing, each of the Services described on _Schedule I_ attached to this Agreement (each, a " _Service_ " and collectively, the " _Services_ "), commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing through the Term (as defined in _Section 4.01_ of this Agreement) unless (a) otherwise specified for a particular Service on _Schedule I_, (b) a particular Service is terminated in accordance with to _Section 4.02_ or _Section 4.03_, (c) otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties in writing, or (d) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof prior to the expiration of the Term. 

  

 Section 1.03 _Quality and Scope of Services_. The Services shall be performed in a manner, amount, and quality substantially consistent with the manner, amount or quality of the Services as was being provided by Harris to the MCD Business during the six-month period 

   ##### 

  

 

prior to the Effective Date, and in no event shall Harris shall have an
obligation to perform any Service in any other manner, amount or quality
(enhanced, increased or otherwise) unless expressly so specified in _Schedule
I_ with respect to a particular Service (including any advantage of systems,
equipment, facilities, training, services or improvements procured,
obtained or made by Harris after the Effective Date). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with respect to any
Service, Harris may, in its sole discretion and at no additional charge to
the Company, (i) perform such Service substantially consistent with
any improved or enhanced practice as Harris deems reasonably prudent, or (ii)
otherwise make changes from time to time in the manner in which such Service
is provided if (A) Harris is making similar changes in the manner in which
such Service is provided for its own businesses, (B) Harris furnishes to the
Company substantially the same notice Harris provides to its own businesses
with respect to such changes, and (C) such changes do not create a
substantial risk that such changes would reasonably result in a material
disruption of the MCD Business as conducted by the Company following the
Closing or in the incurrence of a material loss or liability by the Company. 

   

 Section 1.04 _Additional Services; Initial Costs_. 

  

 (a) In the event that the Company has determined that it requires an increase or enhancement in the manner, amount or quality of any Service as compared to the manner, amount or quality of such Service as was being provided by Harris to the MCD Business during the six-month period prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall notify Harris of such determination and request that Harris so increase or enhance the manner, amount or quality, as the case may be, of such Service. Following the receipt of such notification and request, Harris shall consider in good faith such request by the Company to provide such incremental services; _provided, however_ , that this _Section 1.04_ shall in no way modify or increase Harris obligations under  _Section 1.03_ and Harris shall have the sole right to determine the scope, terms and fees of such incremental services to the extent that Harris elects to increase or enhance the manner, amount or quality of any Service. If Harris agrees to provide such incremental services,  _Schedule I_ to this Agreement shall be amended, without further action by any party hereto, to reflect such incremental services, the scope and terms thereof and the Service Fees therefor (such fees to be determined in accordance with _Section 2.01_ as if such incremental services had been included on _Schedule I_ as of the date hereof). 

   

 (b) If Harris or any of its Affiliates are required to (i) modify, increase, alter, obtain or otherwise change any software, process, method, asset or system (for example, because previously shared hardware capacity must be duplicated) or staffing or (ii) enhance their facilities or training, in order to perform the Services pursuant to _Section 1.02_, then Harris shall obtain the Companys prior written approval of any additional cost or expense that Harris or any of its Affiliates expects to incur in connection with such increase or enhancement, and the Company shall pay any such additional cost or expense incurred by Harris or such Affiliate to provide such Services to the extent so approved by the Company, and if the Company does not approve such additional cost or expense, neither Harris nor any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to provide the Services that require such increases for their respective performances. 

   

 Section 1.05 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that Harris does not as part of its usual or regular conduct of business provide any or all of the Services, or any related services, on a commercial basis and that Harris does not warrant or

REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF
HARRIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. 

   

 Section 1.06 _Independent Contractor; Employees_. The parties acknowledge and agree that each party is engaged in a business that is independent from that of the other party and that Harris shall perform the Services under this Agreement as an independent contractor with the sole right to supervise, manage, operate, control and direct the performance of the Services, including the right to designate which such resources Harris shall assign to perform any Service and the right to remove and replace any such resources at any time or, subject to _Section 6.04(b)_, to designate a third party provider to perform such Service. Harris shall have and maintain exclusive control over all of its own employees, agents, subcontractors and operations as of the Effective Date. Harris shall be solely responsible for payment of compensation to its employees and for any injury to them in the course of their employment. Harris shall assume full responsibility for payment of all federal, state and local taxes or contributions imposed or required under unemployment insurance, social security and income tax Laws with respect to such employees. The Company shall have and maintain exclusive control over all of its own employees, agents, other contractors and operations as of the Effective Date. The Company shall be solely responsible for payment of compensation to its employees and for any injury to them in the course of their employment. The Company shall assume full responsibility for payment of all federal, state and local taxes or contributions imposed or required under unemployment insurance, social security and income tax Laws with respect to such employees. Harris has no authority (express, implied or apparent) to represent the Company as to any matters or to incur any obligations or liability on behalf of the Company, and Harris shall not be, act as, purport to act as, or be deemed to be, the agent, representative, employee or servant of the Company. The Company has no authority (express, implied or apparent) to represent Harris as to any matters or to incur any obligations or liability on behalf of Harris, and the Company shall not be, act as, purport to act as, or be deemed to be, the agent, representative, employee or servant of Harris.

 Section 1.07 _Cooperation; Resources_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Harris and the Company shall use good faith efforts to cooperate with each other in all matters relating to the provision and receipt of Services. Such good faith cooperation shall include, subject to  _Section 5.01_, (i) exchanging information reasonably requested by the other party (including such information reasonably requested in connection with any internal or external audit, whether in the United States or any other country); (ii) providing electronic access to data systems used in connection with the Services; (iii) performing true-ups and adjustments; and (iv) making available, as reasonably requested by the other party, timely decisions, approvals and acceptances, and obtaining all consents, licenses, sublicenses or approvals necessary or desirable in order to permit each party to perform its obligations under this Agreement in a timely and efficient manner. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide information and documentation sufficient for Harris to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement. In connection with the Services, the Company shall make reasonably available for consultation with Harris those employees and consultants or other service providers of the Company reasonably necessary for the effective provision by Harris of such Services. 

   

 (b) In the event any cost is incurred by Harris or any of its Affiliates in connection with obtaining or soliciting the consent of any third party in accordance with  _Section 1.07(a)_, such cost shall be paid by the Company and the Company shall reimburse Harris or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be, upon receipt of an invoice from Harris or its Affiliates, as applicable, with respect to such costs. 

   

 Section 1.08 _Information From the Company; No Duty of Verification_. Harris shall not be liable for any impairment of any Service caused by its not receiving information, either timely or at all, or by its receiving inaccurate or incomplete information from the Company that is required or reasonably requested by Harris. In the absence of actual knowledge to the contrary, Harris shall not have any responsibility for verifying the correctness of any information given to it by or on behalf of the Company for the purpose of providing any Service. 

  

 Section 1.09 _Exceptions to Harris  Obligation to Perform_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Harris shall not be required to provide such Service (i) to the extent the performance of such Service would require Harris to violate any applicable Law or would result in the breach of any contract or agreement due to a failure to obtain necessary consents, licenses, sublicenses, or approvals pursuant to _Section 1.07_; (ii) if Harris reasonably determines that providing such Service would result in a significant disruption of Harris or any of its Affiliates businesses or operations, would materially increase the scope of Harris responsibilities under this Agreement, or would be impracticable; or (iii) if any such Service unreasonably inhibits any employee of Harris or any of its Affiliates from discharging his or her obligations to Harris or any of its Affiliates or places any employee of Harris or any of its Affiliates in a conflict of interest with respect to his or her employment with Harris or any of its Affiliates. If Harris reasonably determines that it is unable to provide any Service in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as a result of the circumstances set forth in subparagraphs (i) through (iii) above, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to determine the best alternative approach. Until such   ##### 

  

  

  

alternative approach is found or the problem is otherwise resolved to the
satisfaction of the parties, Harris shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide a comparable service, or in the case of data systems, support the
function to which the data system relates or permit the Company to have
reasonable access to the data system so that the Company can support the
function itself. In such case, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
determine the amounts to be paid for any such comparable service (such fees
to be determined in accordance with _Section 2.01_ , but including any out-
of-pocket costs incurred by Harris in providing or arranging for such
comparable service). To the extent that Harris provides any comparable
services to the Company pursuant to this _Section 1.09_ and the fees for any
such comparable service (as described in the immediately preceding sentence)
exceed the Service Fee for the corresponding Service that Harris determined
it was unable to provide pursuant to this _Section 1.09_, the parties shall
share such excess amount equally. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: 

   

 (i) if the Company elects to decommission, replace, modify or change its information technology or communications systems, networks, equipment, configurations, processes, procedures, practices or any other aspect of its business relationship relating to a Service in a manner that adversely affects Harris ability to provide such Service as required hereunder, then Harris shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to the effectiveness or quality of such Service and shall be excused from performance of such Service until the Company mitigates the adverse effect of such change, and the Company shall be responsible for all direct expenses incurred by Harris in connection with the cessation and, if applicable, the resumption of such Service; and 

  

 (ii) Harris may suspend performance of any Service and the Companys access to information technology or communications systems used by Harris if, in Harris reasonable judgment, the integrity, security or performance of such systems, or any data stored thereon, is being or is likely to be jeopardized by the activities of the Company, its employees, agents, representatives or contractors. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 COST OF THE SERVICES 

   

 Section 2.01 _Cost of the Services_. In consideration of the provision of the Services, the Company shall pay to Harris, without set-off, a service fee for each such Service in the amount equal to (a) all internal costs allocated to the maximum extent reasonably practicable to the provision of such Service on a fully allocated basis consistent with current charges to the MCD Business, and (b) any additional out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by Harris in connection with the provision of such Service, including without limitation, payments or costs for an ongoing license, grant or provision of rights or services (all such fees with respect to each Service, the " _Service Fee_ ", and collectively for all Services, the " _Service Fees_ "), in each case, with respect to the relevant payment period set forth on _Schedule I_. The Company shall not be obligated to pay for any individual Service that was properly terminated pursuant to _Section 4.02_ or _Section 4.03_ unless the Company knowingly accepts the benefits of such Services following any such termination. The Company will pay Harris the Service Fee relating to any terminated Service until the effective date of termination. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.02 _Manner and Timing of Payments_. All payments shall be made, without set-off, within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice therefor. Harris shall send invoices on a monthly basis for payments to be made under this Agreement. Such invoices shall specify in reasonable detail the costs and expenses to be reimbursed by the Company, and Harris shall provide such supporting detail as the Company may from time to time reasonably request. All payments made by the Company under this Agreement shall be by wire transfer of the payment amount to Harris account identified in _Exhibit A_ attached hereto or other account notified in writing by Harris to the Company, or if requested in writing by Harris, by check. All such payments shall be effective upon receipt. If payment on any invoice is not received as specified herein on the applicable date, such amount shall be subject to a late payment charge calculated at one percent (1%) per month from the due date until payment is made. If the Company disputes in good faith any portion of the amount due on any invoice, then the Company shall notify Harris in writing of the nature and basis of the dispute within 10 Business Days after the Companys receipt of such invoice. If no notification is provided to Harris in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the invoiced amount shall be deemed to be accurate and correct and shall not be subject to dispute or contest by the Company or any Affiliate thereof. In the event notification is so provided to Harris, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve the dispute prior to the payment due date. 

  

 Section 2.03 _Taxes_. Unless the Company provides Harris with a proper tax exemption certificate, the Company shall be responsible for and pay all applicable taxes (including without limitation any sales or value added taxes) that may be imposed with respect to or in connection with the provision of the Services, except for income taxes imposed on Harris for payment received with respect to such Services. To the extent Harris pays or is required to pay any such taxes that are the responsibility of the Company in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Company shall reimburse and indemnify Harris with respect to all amounts (including without limitation attorneys fees and costs of investigation) incurred in connection with the provision of such Services. 

  

 Section 2.04 _Access to Records_. Harris shall keep reasonable books and records of all Services for the Company to verify all charges made by Harris under this Agreement and to comply with all applicable requirements of Law. Harris shall, upon the Companys reasonable request and at the Companys sole cost and expense, make such books and records available to the Company, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours for the sole purpose of the Companys verifying any charges made by Harris hereunder or complying with any applicable requirement of Law. Nothing in this _Section 2.04_ or _Section 4.05_ shall require Harris to maintain its books and records relating to the Services provided to the Company under this Agreement indefinitely or in a manner, or for a length of time, inconsistent with the manner or length of time that it maintains its books and records with respect to its other businesses. 

  

ARTICLE III 
 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 Section 3.01 _Limitation of Liability_. The Company agrees that none of Harris and its Affiliates and their respective, officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (each, a " _Harris Indemnified Person_ " and collectively, the " _Harris Indemnified Persons_ ") shall have any liability, whether direct or indirect, in 

   ##### 

  

 

contract or tort or otherwise, to the Company or any of its Affiliates for or
in connection with the Services provided or to be provided by any Harris
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement or any other services provided

Agreement, or any Harris Indemnified Persons actions or inactions
in connection with any such Services, any such other services, or any such

Harris Indemnified Persons gross negligence or willful misconduct in
connection with any such Services, other services, transactions, actions
or inactions. 

   

 Section 3.02 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Harris Indemnified Person from and against all damages, claims, losses, charges, actions, suits, proceedings, deficiencies, taxes, interest, penalties and reasonable costs and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ "), and shall reimburse each Harris Indemnified Person for all reasonable expenses as they are incurred in investigating, preparing, pursuing, or defending any claim, action, proceeding, or investigation, whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation and whether or not any Harris Indemnified Person is a party (each, an " _Action_ "), related to, arising out of, or in connection or associated with Services provided or to be provided by any Harris Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement or any other services provided by any Harris Indemnified Person, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any Harris Indemnified Persons actions or inactions in connection with any such Services, any such other services, or any such transactions; _provided_ that no Company Indemnified Person will be responsible for any damages of any Harris Indemnified Person that have directly resulted from such Harris Indemnified Persons gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with any such Services, other services, transactions, actions, or inactions. 

  

 Section 3.03 _Indemnification by Harris_. Harris shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and their respective, officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (each, a " _Company Indemnified Person_ " and collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against all Losses, and shall reimburse each Company Indemnified Person for all reasonable expenses as they are incurred in investigating, preparing, pursuing or defending any Action, arising directly out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Harris Indemnified Person in connection with the Services provided or to be provided pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 3.04 _Indemnification Procedures_. The indemnification procedures set forth in Section 12.2(b) and Section 12.4 of the Formation Agreement shall apply equally to any claims for indemnification brought pursuant to this Article 3. 

  

 Section 3.05 _Maximum Liability; Limitation of Damages_. Except to the extent such liability arises directly out of a Harris Indemnified Persons gross negligence or willful misconduct, the maximum aggregate liability of all Harris Indemnified Persons under or in connection with this Agreement, in any and all events, shall be limited in the aggregate to the Service Fees paid by the Company and actually received by Harris under this Agreement. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT OR AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY HARRIS INDEMNIFIED PERSON BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE OR FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR 

   ##### 

  

 

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUES, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS,
LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO DATA, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS) AS A RESULT OF OR ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO

OF REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OR COVENANT, OR INDEMNIFICATION OR OTHERWISE,
AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH HARRIS INDEMNIFIED PERSON KNEW OF OR WAS
ADVISED AT THE TIME OF BREACH OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES.
THE COMPANY, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH OTHER COMPANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON,
HEREBY WAIVES ANY CLAIMS THAT THESE EXCLUSIONS DEPRIVE THE COMPANY OR ANY
SUCH COMPANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON OF AN ADEQUATE REMEDY. 

   

ARTICLE IV 
 TERM AND TERMINATION 

   

 Section 4.01 _Term_. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall terminate with respect to each Service as set forth on _Schedule I_ with respect to such Service; _provided_ that this Agreement shall terminate with respect to all Services provided hereunder upon the earlier of (a) such time when all Services to be provided by Harris under this Agreement have been terminated (or the terms of which have expired) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (b) the one year anniversary of the Effective Date (the " _Term_ "), unless this Agreement is terminated sooner in accordance with _Section 4.02_ or _Section 4.03_ or extended by mutual written agreement of the parties, which agreement shall set forth the length of the desired extension, the scope of the Services to be provided during such extension, and any fees relating to such Services, including any increase in such fees. Any termination or expiration of this Agreement with respect to any particular Service shall not terminate this Agreement with respect to any other Service provided under this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, upon written notice received by Harris at least 30 days prior to the termination of the Information Technology Services set forth on _Schedule I_ in accordance with this Agreement, Harris shall continue to provide such Information Technology Services that were provided to the Company immediately prior to such termination for an additional six (6) month period;  _provided, however_ , that _Section 2.01_ shall not apply during such six (6) month period and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine a commercially reasonable fee for such services during that period. 

  

 Section 4.02 _Termination for Default_. In the event: (a) the Company shall fail to pay for any or all Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (and such payment is not disputed by the Company in good faith in accordance with _Section 2.02_); (b) of any default by either party, in any material respect, in the due performance or observance by it of any of the other terms, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or (c) either party shall 

   ##### 

  

 

become or be adjudicated insolvent and/or bankrupt, or a receiver or trustee
shall be appointed for either party or its property or a petition for
reorganization or arrangement under any bankruptcy or insolvency Law shall be
approved, or either party shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or
shall consent to the appointment of a receiver or trustee (in each such case,
the " _Defaulting Party_ "); then any non-Defaulting Party shall have the
right, at its sole discretion, (i) in the case of a default under clause (c),
to terminate immediately the applicable Service(s) and/or this Agreement and
its participation with the Defaulting Party under this Agreement; and (ii) in
the case of a default under clause (a) or (b), to terminate the
applicable Service(s) and/or this Agreement and its participation with the
Defaulting Party under this Agreement if the Defaulting Party has failed to
(x) cure the default, within 30 days after receiving written notice of such
default, or if the default (except for defaults as a result of failure to
make payment) is such that it will take more than 30 days to cure, within an
extended time period which shall be not longer than what is reasonably
necessary to effect performance or compliance or (y) take substantial steps
towards and diligently pursue the curing of the default. 

   

 Section 4.03 _Termination by the Company_.

Any particular Service may be separately terminated by the Company upon the expiration of the longer of (a) thirty (30) days prior written notice to Harris or (b) the required prior written notice to Harris as specified for such Service on _Schedule I_. 

  

 Section 4.04 _Effect of Termination_. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or of any Service provided hereunder, all rights and obligations of the parties shall cease under the Agreement with respect to all Services (in the case of a termination of the Agreement) or with respect to such Service (in the case of a termination of a particular Service), except as provided in _Section 4.05_ and except that the Company shall pay to Harris within thirty (30) calendar days of the expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Service, as the case may be, all amounts that are or that will become due and payable as a result of the provision of the Services pursuant to this Agreement in the manner set forth in _Article 2_. Upon notice of termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms with respect to any Service for any reason or, in the event of expiration, for a reasonable period time prior to such expiration, Harris will reasonably cooperate, at the Companys expense, in order to minimize the disruption to the business of both parties and to effect an orderly transition and transfer of the responsibility for such Service(s) to the Company or to a third party designated by the Company, including the migration of the data described in _Section 5.05_ to the Company or its third party designee. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or any Service, as the case may be, each party, at the request of the other, shall return or destroy, at the option of the party in possession of such Confidential Information (as defined herein), all Confidential Information in its possession or control which belongs to the other party or any other information that contains or comprises the other partys information and to which the returning party does not retain rights hereunder (except one copy of which may be retained in such files for archival purposes). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Company shall no longer have any access to Harris information, data, systems and other assets that are not Contributed Assets. If requested by the other party, an appropriate 

   ##### 

  

 

officer of the party in possession of such information returned or destroyed
pursuant to this paragraph will certify to the other party that all such
information has been so delivered or destroyed. 

   

 Section 4.05 _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) _Article 2_, _Article 3_, _Section 4.04_, _Section 4.05_, _Article 5_ and _Article 6_ shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement; and (b) the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not act as a waiver of any breach of this Agreement and shall not act as a release of either party for any liability or obligation incurred under this Agreement through the effective date of the termination or expiration; _provided, however_ , that neither party shall be liable for damages of any sort resulting solely from terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

ARTICLE V 
 CONFIDENTIALITY; OWNERSHIP OF DATA 

   

 Section 5.01 _Definitions of Confidential Information, Disclosing Party and Recipient_. " _Confidential Information_ " shall mean any information of a party (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") or its customers designated as confidential and received or obtained by the other party (the " _Recipient_ ") as a result of the exercise of the Recipients rights or the performance of the Recipients obligations under this Agreement, and includes, without limitation, any business, marketing, technical and scientific information, trade secrets, processes, designs, data, formulae, plans, prototypes, software, source code, customer information and lists, research, business opportunities, agreements and other information related to or arising from the Services and which may be in any form or medium; _provided_ , that any such information disclosed in non-written form shall be reduced to writing within thirty (30) days of its disclosure to the Recipient. In addition to the foregoing, Harris agrees that any information relating primarily to the operations or affairs of the MCD Business as such business is conducted by the Company following the Closing that is disclosed by the Company to Harris in the course of performing Services under this Agreement and that is or should be reasonably understood to be confidential or proprietary to the Company shall be "Confidential Information" of the Company under this Agreement, regardless of whether such information is designated as confidential or reduced to writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential Information" shall not include any information that (a) becomes generally available other than as a result of a breach of the provisions of this  _Article 5_; (b) was received or becomes available on a nonconfidential basis to the Recipient from a source, other than the Disclosing Party or its customers, that to the Recipients knowledge is not or was not bound to hold such information confidential, (c) was acquired or developed independently by the Recipient without the use of the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information and without violating this _Article 5_ or any other confidentiality agreement with the Disclosing Party; or (d) is approved in writing for release or disclosure to the public by the Disclosing Party. 

  

 Section 5.02 _Use and Disclosure Limitations_. Except pursuant to _Section 5.03_ , unless instructed otherwise by the Disclosing Party in writing, any Confidential Information received or obtained by the Recipient as a result of the exercise of its rights or the performance of its obligations under this Agreement shall be kept in confidence and not be used for any purpose other than to provide or receive, as the case may be, the Services under this Agreement or 

   ##### 

  

 

otherwise as required for the Recipient to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and shall only be disclosed to others if the Recipient reasonably
believes such disclosure is necessary or appropriate in the course of
providing or receiving, as the case may be, such Services and only under
obligations of confidence. The Recipient shall treat the Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party in the same manner as the Recipient
treats and holds its own confidential information of a similar nature (in the
case of Harris, such manner shall be determined only with respect to the
commercial segment(s) of Harris businesses), but in no case with less than
a commercially reasonable standard of care. 

   

 Section 5.03 _Disclosure Required by Law_. In the event that disclosure of Confidential Information is compelled by judicial or administrative process or required by operation of Law, the Recipient will (a) if permitted by such process or Law, provide prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party and, at the Disclosing Partys cost and expense, assist the Disclosing Party in seeking a protective order or other similar remedy; (b) furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is, on the advice of its legal counsel, required to be disclosed pursuant to such process or Law; and (c) exercise reasonable efforts in good faith to ensure that confidential treatment is accorded to such disclosed Confidential Information. 

  

 Section 5.04 _Relief_. The Recipient agrees that unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm and result in significant commercial damage to the Disclosing Party. The parties agree that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any breach of the covenants regarding Confidential Information, in addition to all other remedies available at law and in equity. 

  

 Section 5.05 _Other Related Matters_. With respect to any Service, the Company agrees that (i) all software, hardware or data store, procedures and materials provided to the Company by or on behalf of Harris in connection with such Service are solely for the use of the Company solely for purposes of using such Services during the Term ( _provided_ that benefits received by third parties in the ordinary course of business conducted with the Company shall not be subject to this  _Section 5.05_); (ii) title to any software, hardware or data store or any other intellectual property or proprietary right of any kind used in performing such Service shall, as between the Company and Harris, remain in Harris; (iii) the Company shall not copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, distribute or in any way alter or make derivative works of any software, hardware or data store used in performing such Service without Harris prior written consent; and (iv) the Company shall comply with any and all usage guidelines pertaining to any Service and provided by or on behalf of Harris, including without limitation, any and all usage guidelines pertaining to software, data, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any assets acquired or purchased by the Company for its own account, shall not be subject to this _Section 5.05_. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement or in the performance or use of the Services under this Agreement shall be deemed to transfer, assign or otherwise convey any rights, title or interests in or to any intellectual property or proprietary rights of one party to the other party. Nothing in this _Article 5_ shall be construed as obligating any party hereto to disclose its Confidential Information to any other party or person, or as granting to or conferring on any other party or person, expressly or by implication, any rights or license to the first partys Confidential Information; _provided_ that the parties acknowledge that, in order to perform the Services, Harris shall have custody of and usage of 

   ##### 

  

 

certain of the Companys Confidential Information and the Company hereby
grants to Harris the right to do so in accordance with this Agreement. Harris
agrees that all right, title and interest in and to all records, data, files,
input materials, reports, forms and other data received, computed, used
and/or stored pursuant to this Agreement which relate to the MCD Business
as conducted by the Company after the Effective Date are the exclusive
property of the Company.

 (a) Except as provided in _Section 6.04(b)_, no party may assign this Agreement or any rights, benefits, obligations or remedies hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, except that no such consent shall be required for a transfer by operation of Law in connection with a merger or consolidation of such party.

This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by and against the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 THIS WARRANT ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT (the " _Assumption Agreement_ ") dated as of [Closing Date], by and between HARRIS STRATEX NETWORKS, INC., a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware (" _Newco_ "), and STRATEX NETWORKS, INC., a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware (" _Stratex_ "), is made and delivered pursuant to _Section 6_ of those certain Warrants to Purchase Common Stock of Stratex (the " _Warrants_ ") issued in connection with the Purchase Agreement dated as of September 21, 2004 by and between Stratex and certain Investors listed in _Schedule I_ attached thereto. All capitalized terms used in this Assumption Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Warrants. 

  

 Pursuant to a Formation, Contribution and Merger Agreement, dated September 5, 2006 (the " _Combination Agreement_ "), between Stratex and Harris Corporation, Stratex will merge into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newco (the " _Merger_ "). In the Merger, each outstanding share, par value $0.01 per share, of Stratex Common Stock (the " _Stratex Common Stock_ ") will be converted into one-fourth of a share, par value $0.01 per share, of Class A Common Stock of Newco (the " _Class A Common Stock_"). Under the terms of the Combination Agreement, Newco has agreed to enter into this Assumption Agreement pursuant to which it will assume Stratexs obligations under the Warrants. 

  

 Effective upon the effective time of the Merger, 

   

 (i) Stratex shall be released from its obligations under the Warrants. 

  

 (ii) Newco hereby assumes the obligations of Stratex under the Warrants and agrees that it shall be the "Company" for all purposes of the Warrants. Without limiting the foregoing, the undersigned hereby agrees to perform all of the obligations of the Company under, and to be bound in all respects by the terms of, the Warrants, to the same extent and with the same force and effect as if the undersigned were an original signatory thereto. At the effective time of the Merger, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Warrants, each Warrant shall automatically become exercisable for that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to one-fourth of the number of shares of Stratex Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger at an exercise price per share of Class A Common Stock equal to four (4) times the exercise price of such Warrant per share of Stratex Common Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, or $11.80 per share of Class A Common Stock. 

  

 Upon the execution and delivery of this Assumption Agreement by Stratex and Newco, the terms of the Warrants shall be supplemented in accordance herewith, and this Assumption Agreement shall form a part of the terms of the Warrants for all purposes, and every Registered Holder of a Warrant heretofore countersigned and delivered shall be bound hereby. 

  

 Except as expressly amended and supplemented hereby, the terms of the Warrants are in all respects ratified and confirmed and all terms, conditions and provisions of the Warrants shall remain in full force and effect. 

   ##### 

  

  

 This Assumption Agreement is an agreement supplemental to and in implementation of the terms of the Warrants, and the terms of the Warrants, and this Assumption Agreement shall be read and construed together. 

  

 Any notice or demand authorized or permitted by the terms of the Warrants to be given or made by the Registered Holder of any Warrants to or on Newco shall be sufficiently given or made when and if deposited in the mail, first class or registered, postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is provided to the Registered Holders in writing by Newco), as follows:

 All covenants and agreements in this Assumption Agreement by Newco shall bind and incur to the benefit of its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. 

  

 This Assumption Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of said state. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state of New York and any federal court located in such state in connection with any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Assumption Agreement. 

  

 Nothing in this Assumption Agreement shall be construed to give to any person other than Newco, Stratex and the Registered Holders of the Warrants any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Assumption Agreement; but this Assumption Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of Newco, Stratex and the Registered Holders of the Warrants. 

  

 This Assumption Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and each of such counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

AFFILIATES LETTER

   

_____________ ___, 200__ 

   

Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. 
 [Address]

   

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

   

 I have been advised that, as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Stratex Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), as such term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). 

  

 Pursuant to the terms of the Formation, Contribution and Merger Agreement, dated as of September ___, 2006, as amended as of _______________, 2006 (as it may be further amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the " _Formation Agreement_ "), among the Company, Harris Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Harris Stratex Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Harris Stratex_ "), and Stratex Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), the undersigned will receive shares of Class A common stock of Harris Stratex (" _Class A Common Stock_") in exchange for the shares of common stock of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") owned by the undersigned at the effective date of the merger provided for in the Formation Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Formation Agreement. 

  

 I have been advised that the offering, sale and delivery of Harris Stratex Common Stock pursuant to the Formation Agreement will be registered under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. I have also been advised that because I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company at the time the Formation Agreement is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, my ability to sell, assign or transfer any shares of Class A Common Stock that I receive in exchange for any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Formation Agreement may be restricted unless such sale, assignment or transfer is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. I understand that such exemptions are limited and I have obtained advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act to the sale of such Securities. 

  

 I hereby represent and warrant to and covenant to Harris Stratex that: 

  

 A. I will not sell, assign or transfer any shares of Class A Common Stock except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) by a sale made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (as such rule may be hereafter from time to time amended) (and otherwise in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if I am an affiliate of Harris Stratex and if so required at the time) or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion 

   ##### 

  

    

of independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Harris Stratex or under a
"no-action" obtained by me from the Staff of the Commission, is not required
to be registered under the Securities Act. 

  

 B. I understand that neither Harris Stratex nor Merger Sub is under any obligation to register the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of the shares of Class A Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available solely as a result of the Formation Agreement. 

  

 C. In the event of a sale of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145 under the Securities Act, I will supply Harris Stratex with evidence of compliance with such Rule in the form of customary sellers and brokers Rule 145 representation letters or as Harris Stratex may otherwise reasonably request. In the event of a sale by me of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to an opinion of counsel or no-action letter referred to in paragraph A above, I will provide Harris Stratex with a copy of such opinion or no-action letter concurrently with such sale. 

  

 D. I acknowledge and agree that appropriate legends will be placed on certificates representing shares of Class A Common Stock delivered to me, which legends will be removed if (i) one year shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Class A Common Stock received pursuant to the Formation Agreement and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then applicable to me, (ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Class A Common Stock received pursuant to the Formation Agreement and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable to me, or (iii) Harris Stratex has received either an opinion of independent counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Harris Stratex, or a "no action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Securities Act no longer apply to me. 

  

 E. I further understand and agree that Harris Stratex may instruct the transfer agent for Class A Common Stock not to register the transfer of any shares of Class A Common Stock held by me unless any such transfer is made in accordance with this letter agreement and any instructions contained in the legend on the certificates representing such shares of Class A Common Stock. 

  

 F. I also understand that, unless any transfer by me of my shares of Class A Common Stock has been registered under the Securities Act or is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, Harris Stratex reserves the right to place an appropriate legend on any certificates issued to my transferee. 

  

 G. I agree that I will, and will cause each of the other parties (who shall be identified to Harris Stratex by me prior to the Effective Time) whose shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by me to, have all shares of Class A Common Stock owned by me or such parties registered in your name or the name of such party, as the 

   ##### 

  

    

case may be, prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and not in the name of
any bank, broker-dealer, nominee or clearing house. 

  

 H. I understand and agree that the representations, warranties and covenants and agreements by me set forth herein are for the benefit of Harris Stratex, Harris, the Company and Merger Sub and will be relied upon by such entities and their respective counsel and accountants. 

  

 I. I understand and agree that this letter agreement applies to all shares of the capital stock of Harris Stratex and the Company that are deemed beneficially owned by me pursuant to applicable federal securities laws. 

  

 Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter. 

  

 This letter agreement constitutes the complete understanding between Harris Stratex and me concerning the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts to be performed wholly in the State of Delaware. 

   ##### 

  

  

 If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by signing below and returning a copy of this letter to the undersigned, at which time this letter shall become a binding agreement between us.

 Section 5\. _No Representations and Warranties_. Neither Harris nor the Company make any representation or warranty, whether express or implied, in this Agreement with respect to the Assumed Contracts or the Assumed Liabilities. Nothing contained in this _Section 5_ shall limit any representation or warranty contained in the Formation Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement other than this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6\. _Further Actions_. Harris and the Company shall execute or cause to be delivered to the other party such instruments and other documents, and shall take such other actions, as the other party may reasonably request after the date hereof, for the purpose of carrying out or evidencing the Assignment or the acceptance of the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7\. _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver Of Jury Trial_. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in any Delaware Court or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any Delaware Court; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing each party agrees that any claim which primarily seeks injunctive relief and related monetary claims that cannot be brought in any Delaware Court for jurisdiction reasons may be commenced, heard and determined in any other court having proper jurisdiction over such claim. The parties hereby consent to and grant any

Delaware Court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 9_ or in such other manner as
may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. 

  

 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 6_. 

  

 Section 8\. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. If necessary to effect the intent of the parties, the parties will negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to replace the unenforceable language with enforceable language which as closely as possible reflects such intent. 

  

 Section 9\. _Amendment_. The terms of this Agreement can only be changed, modified, released or discharged pursuant to a written agreement executed by each of the parties hereto. No failure or delay by any party to take any action with respect to a breach by another party of this Agreement or a default by another party hereunder shall constitute a waiver of the former partys right to enforce any provision of this Agreement or to take action with respect to such breach or default or any subsequent breach or default. Waiver by any party of any breach or failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement by another party shall not be construed as, or constitute, a continuing wavier of such provisions, or a waiver of any other breach of or failure to comply with any other provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 10\. _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but may not be assigned by one party without the prior written consent of the other parties.
