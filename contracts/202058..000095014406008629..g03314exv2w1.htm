unresolved questions or claims concerning Stratex&#146;s or any of its Subsidiaries&#146; Tax liability that
are reasonably likely to have a Stratex Material Adverse Effect and are not disclosed or provided
for in the Stratex Reports. Stratex has made available to Harris true and correct copies of the
United States federal income Tax Returns (including all schedules and attachments thereto) filed by
Stratex and its Subsidiaries for each of its fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2005, March&nbsp;31, 2004 and
March&nbsp;31, 2003. Neither Stratex nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability with respect to
income, franchise or other Taxes that accrued on or before March&nbsp;31, 2005 in excess of the amounts
accrued with respect thereto that are reflected in the financial statements included in the Stratex
Reports filed on or prior to the date hereof. Neither Stratex nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
a party to the distribution of stock of a controlled corporation as defined in Section 355(a) of
the Code in a transaction intended to qualify under Section&nbsp;355 of the Code within the past two
years. For any transaction in which Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries entered into an agreement
to treat a stock purchase as an asset purchase for United States federal income tax purposes, a
valid election under Section&nbsp;338 of the Code was timely filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service. None of Stratex or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any transactions that are the
same as, or substantially similar to, any transaction which is a &#147;reportable transaction&#148; for

intends to seek such indemnity, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the party from
whom indemnification may be sought hereunder (the &#147;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&#148;) in writing of such
claim or action; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that any failure by such Indemnified Party to such give such
notice promptly will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its indemnification obligation
hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure.
In case any such action shall be brought against any Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate therein or, at its election, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this <U>ARTICLE XII</U> for any legal expenses
of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs of investigation) unless the Indemnified
Party shall have been advised by counsel that representation of the Indemnified Party by counsel
provided by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting
interests between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, including situations in which
there are one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to Indemnifying Party; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that notwithstanding the
foregoing the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but
substantially similar actions arising out of the same general allegations, be liable for the fees
and expenses of more than one separate set of counsel at any time for all Indemnified Parties,
except to the extent that local counsel, in addition to their regular counsel, is required in order
to effectively defend against such action. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified Party is an
actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
(i)&nbsp;includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of
such action or claim and (ii)&nbsp;does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault,
culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party. No indemnification
shall be available in respect of any settlement of any action or claim effected by an Indemnified
Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action
brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the

failure of the corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or the

indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. <U>Scope of Agreement</U>. Harris and the Company desire to set forth in this
Agreement certain terms and conditions upon which Harris will hold its equity interests in the
Company, including but not limited its rights as a holder of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. Solely with
respect to Harris&#146; rights as a holder of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, if there is any inconsistency
between the terms of this Agreement and the Governing Instruments as a result of any amendment of
this Agreement or otherwise, the parties agree to take promptly all necessary action to amend the
Governing Instruments to eliminate such inconsistency to the fullest extent permitted by Law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2. <U>Governing Instruments and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock</U>. On or prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Harris and Stratex have caused the Company to be
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with Governing Instruments in the form
attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> and <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U>. As of the date of this Agreement,
Harris owns, directly or indirectly through its Affiliates, all the outstanding Class&nbsp;B Common
Stock and the shareholders of Stratex immediately prior to the Effective Time own all the
outstanding Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Pursuant to the Governing Instruments, the rights and privileges
of the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock are identical in all respects except that
the holders of the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock have the additional right to vote separately as a class to
elect, remove and replace the Class&nbsp;B Directors (the &#147;<U>Additional Voting Rights</U>&#148;), the right
to receive Class&nbsp;B Common Stock instead of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock in certain circumstances, the
absence of certain duties and obligations with respect to Corporate Opportunities (as defined in
the Governing Instruments) and preemptive rights consistent with those granted in Section&nbsp;4.5
hereof. The holders of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock also have the right at any time to exchange (a)&nbsp;any
outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock held by such holder for an equal number of shares of
Class&nbsp;B Common Stock or (b)&nbsp;any outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock for an equal number of
shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, in each case as provided in the Governing Instruments. Each
outstanding share of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock shall convert into one outstanding share of Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock automatically and without any further action by the Company or any other Person if:
(i)&nbsp;the holders of all of the outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock (assuming that all the
outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock which are then exchangeable for Class&nbsp;B Common Stock
have been so exchanged) are collectively entitled to cast less than 10% of the Total Voting Power
or (ii)&nbsp;such Class&nbsp;B Common Stock is transferred by a holder to any Person who is not an Affiliate
of such holder or a Nominee of such holder or one of its Affiliates; <I>provided, however, </I>that
notwithstanding the foregoing no such conversion shall occur if such transfer is part of a transfer
by such holder and its Affiliates of all of the shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock then owned by them
(either directly or through a Nominee (as defined below)) to any other Person or to any other
Person and its Affiliates. As of the date of this Agreement, the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock represents
56 % of the outstanding Common Stock determined on a fully diluted basis using the treasury stock
method assuming a market price per share of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
equal to $20.80.

Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the Company shall (and shall cause each

internal policies and procedures will impose certain requirements on its divisions and subsidiaries
with respect to the type and format of financial information provided to Harris&#146; management at the
end of each fiscal quarter and fiscal year end and that Harris currently requires such information
to be so provided no later than the eighth (8th) Business Day following the end of each fiscal

such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and is required to file its Quarterly

make file such reports with the SEC before the Company is currently required to file its Quarterly

future. Senior employees of the Company and Harris with responsibility for preparation and review
of SEC filings will actively consult with each other regarding the details of the Quarterly Reports

&#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Harris and Stratex have entered into a Formation, Contribution and Merger Agreement,
dated as of September&nbsp;5, 2006 (the &#147;<U>Formation Agreement</U>&#148;), pursuant to which the Company
was formed to acquire Stratex pursuant to the Merger and to receive the Contributed Assets from
Harris in the Contribution Transaction, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Formation Agreement;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, because of the importance of preserving the value of the business being contributed
by Harris as a going concern, Stratex was not willing to enter into the Formation Agreement without
the undertakings of Harris contained in this Agreement; and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition to closing under the

the parties agree as follows:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Definitions</U>. The term &#147;<U>Restricted Business</U>&#148; means the development,
manufacture, distribution and sale of any microwave radio systems and related components, systems

(ii)&nbsp;which are substantially similar to such products in form, fit and function when used in
terrestrial microwave point-to-point communications networks that provide access and trunking of
voice and data for telecommunications networks anywhere in the world. In addition, all capitalized
terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Formation Agreement; <I>provided, however</I>, that notwithstanding the foregoing neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Harris or any of its
other Subsidiaries or Affiliates for purposes of this Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <U>Non-Competition</U>. In consideration for the issuance to Harris of shares of the
Company pursuant to the Formation Agreement and the performance by Stratex of its obligations under
the Agreements (collectively, the &#147;<U>Non-Compete Consideration</U>&#148;), Harris agrees that, during
the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the fifth anniversary of the date
hereof, Harris will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to (a)&nbsp;engage, directly or
indirectly, in the Restricted Business, (b)&nbsp;form any Person other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries (a &#147;<U>Covered Person</U>&#148;) or change or extend the current business activities of
any existing Covered Person for the purpose of engaging, directly or indirectly, in the Restricted
Business or (c)&nbsp;invest, directly or indirectly, in any Covered Person engaged, directly or
indirectly, in the Restricted Business in any material respect; <I>provided, however, </I>that
notwithstanding the foregoing Harris and/or its Subsidiaries may (i)&nbsp;collectively own less than 20%
of the total equity interests in any Covered Person engaged in the Restricted Business as

Covered Person&#146;s or business unit&#146;s, as applicable, total revenues (based on its latest annual
audited financial statements, if available) and (y)&nbsp;such Covered Person or Harris, as applicable,
divests or ceases to conduct the Restricted Business within 18&nbsp;months after the acquisition date.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the defined term &#147;Restricted Business&#148;
shall not include, and the prohibition contained in this <U>Section&nbsp;2</U> shall in no way prohibit
Harris and/or its Subsidiaries from, (a)&nbsp;purchasing and reselling products produced by, and marked

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>Sufficiency of Consideration</U>. Each of the parties acknowledges that the
Non-Compete Consideration is sufficient consideration for the duration and scope of the
non-competition agreement contained herein and that such duration and scope are reasonable in all
respects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U>Severability; Enforceability</U>. If any provision of this Agreement, or any part
thereof, is held by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court or authority making such determination will have
the power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision or to delete specific words or phrases
as necessary (but only to the minimum extent necessary) to cause such provision or part to be valid
and enforceable. If such court or authority does not have the legal authority to take the actions
described in the preceding sentence, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith a modified
provision that would, in so far as possible, reflect the original intent of this Agreement without
violating applicable law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<U>Availability of Injunctive Relief</U>. The parties hereto acknowledge and recognize
that irreparable damage could result to the Company and its Subsidiaries, businesses and properties
if Harris fails or refuses to perform its obligations under this Agreement and that no adequate
remedy at law will exist for any breach by Harris of this Agreement. In addition to any other
rights or remedies and damages available, the Company shall be entitled to appropriate injunctive
relief, including preliminary and mandatory injunctive relief, enjoining or restraining Harris or
any of its Subsidiaries from any violation or threatened violation of this Agreement.

located in the State of Delaware (collectively, the &#147;<U>Delaware Courts</U>&#148;) solely in respect of
the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby waive, and agree

proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in any Delaware Court or that the venue
thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in

party (in the case of an amendment) or the waiving party (in the case of a waiver). No failure or
delay by any party to take any action with respect to a breach by another party of this Agreement

enforce any provision of this Agreement or to take action with respect to such breach or default or
any subsequent breach or default. Waiver by any party of any breach or failure to comply with any

this <U>Section&nbsp;6</U> (an &#147;<U>Indemnitor</U>&#148;), notify such Indemnitor in writing of the
commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have to any Indemnitee except to the extent the Indemnitor is actually
prejudiced thereby. In case any such action shall be brought against any Indemnitee and it shall
notify an Indemnitor of the commencement thereof, such Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate
therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other Indemnitor similarly
notified, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee
(which shall not be counsel to the Indemnitor without the consent of the Indemnitee, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). After notice from the Indemnitor to such Indemnitee of
its election so to assume the defense thereof, such Indemnitor shall not be liable to such
Indemnitee under this <U>Section&nbsp;6</U> or otherwise for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee, in connection with the
defense thereof (other than reasonable costs of investigation) unless the Indemnitee shall have
been advised by counsel that representation of the Indemnitee by counsel provided by the Indemnitor
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests between the Indemnitee and
the Indemnitor, including situations in which there are one or more legal defenses available to the
Indemnitee that are different from or additional to those available to Indemnitor; <I>provided,
however</I>, that the Indemnitor shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but
substantially similar actions arising out of the same general allegations, be liable for the fees
and expenses of more than one separate counsel at any time for all Indemnitees, except to the
extent that local counsel, in addition to their regular counsel, is required in order to
effectively defend against such action. No Indemnitor shall, without the written consent of the
Indemnitee, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or
contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnitee is an actual or potential party
to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i)&nbsp;includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such action or claim and
(ii)&nbsp;does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to
act, by or on behalf of any Indemnitee. No indemnification shall be available in respect of any
settlement of any action or claim effected by an Indemnitee without the prior written consent of
the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnitee under <U>Section&nbsp;6(a)</U> or <U>Section&nbsp;6(b)</U>
hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
referred to therein, then each Indemnitor shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnitee as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnitor and
the Indemnitee in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall be determined

fact or omission or

or by such Indemnitee, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it
would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;6(d)</U> were
determined solely by pro rata allocation (even if the Electing Holders or any underwriters, selling
agents or other securities professionals or all of them were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the considerations
referred to in this <U>Section&nbsp;6(d)</U>. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnitee as a result
of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above
shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such
Indemnitee in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of <U>Section&nbsp;11(f)</U> of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Electing Holders and any underwriters,
selling agents or other securities professionals in this <U>Section&nbsp;6(d)</U> to contribute shall
be several in proportion to the percentage of Applicable Securities registered or underwritten, as
the case may be, by them and not joint.

par value $0.01 per share, of Stratex Common Stock (the &#147;<U>Stratex Common Stock</U>&#148;) will be
converted into one-fourth of a share, par value $0.01 per share, of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock of Newco

shall automatically become exercisable for that number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock equal to
one-fourth of the number of shares of Stratex Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger at an exercise price per share of Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock equal to four (4)&nbsp;times the exercise price of such Warrant per share of Stratex Common
Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, or $11.80 per share of Class&nbsp;A Common
