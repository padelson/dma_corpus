Bioceres' post-Closing ownership of Union to amount that is below fifty-one
percent (51%) of the then outstanding Union Ordinary Shares (taking into
account all outstanding Union Warrants to the extent provided in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.7874-2(h)). In the event that a payment resulting from
an Indemnification Claim would reduce Bioceres' post-Closing ownership of
Union to an amount that is below fifty-one percent (51%) of the then
outstanding Union Ordinary Shares (taking into account all outstanding Union
Warrants to the extent provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.7874-2(h)),
Bioceres shall make up any shortfall in cash (subject to the caps on liability
set forth herein).

 

Section 2.5. _Working Capital Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) At least five (5) Business Days before the Closing, Bioceres shall prepare
and deliver to Union a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital
Statement_ ") setting forth its good faith estimate of Closing Working Capital
(the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "), which statement shall contain
(i) line items for estimated Current Assets of the Group the Group Companies,
estimated Current Liabilities of the Group Companies and estimated
Indebtedness of the Group Companies and (ii) a certificate of an authorized
officer of Bioceres that the Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement was
prepared in accordance with IFRS applied as of the date of such Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement. _Schedule 2.5_ sets forth an illustrative
statement prepared in good faith by Bioceres in cooperation with Union, and
their respective accountants, setting forth the various line items used (or to
be used) in, and illustrating for sample purposes only as of the date hereof,
the calculation of Closing Working Capital, prepared in accordance with this
Agreement.

 

(b) The " _Closing Adjustment_ " shall be an amount equal to the Estimated
Closing Working Capital _minus_ the Target Working Capital _plus_ the
difference, if positive, of (x) US$101,000,000 _minus_ (y) the Group
Companies' Indebtedness at the time of the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Statement. If the Closing Adjustment is a negative number, then either (A)
Bioceres shall pay Union at the Closing an amount in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds equal to the absolute value of the Closing
Adjustment or (B) Parent shall assume one or more borrowings constituting
Indebtedness representing an amount equal to the absolute value of the Closing
Adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Closing Adjustment is a
positive number, Union shall have no obligation to pay Bioceres any amount in
cash or otherwise.

 

Section 2.6. _Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable, but not later than forty-five (45) days after the
Closing Date, Union shall prepare and deliver to the Pre-Closing Union
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Working Capital Statement_ ")
setting forth its calculation of Closing Working Capital, which statement
shall contain (i) line items for Current Assets of the Group Companies as of
the Closing Date, Current Liabilities of the Group Companies as of the Closing
Date and Indebtedness of the Group Companies as of the Closing Date and (ii) a
certificate of an authorized officer of Union that the Closing Working Capital
Statement was prepared in accordance with IFRS applied as of the date of such
Closing Working Capital Statement.

   

(b) The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " shall be an amount equal to the Closing
Working Capital _minus_ the Estimated Closing Working Capital _plus_ the
difference, if positive, of (x) US$101,000,000 _minus_ (y) the Group
Companies' Indebtedness at the time of the Closing Working Capital Statement.
If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number, then either (A) Bioceres
shall pay Union an amount in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment or (B) Parent
shall assume one or more borrowings constituting Indebtedness representing an
amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the
Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, Union shall pay Bioceres an
amount in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds equal to the
Post-Closing Adjustment, subject to a cap equal to the amount in cash Union
may have received in connection with _Section 2.5(b)_.

 

(c) After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement, the Pre-Closing
Union Representative shall have thirty (30) days (the " _Review Period_ ") to
review the Closing Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, the
Pre-Closing Union Representative, its accountants and their respective
Representatives shall, upon advance notice, and, to the extent that they
relate to the Closing Working Capital Statement, have reasonable access to (i)
the books and records of the Group Companies, (ii) the personnel of Union and
(iii) work papers prepared by Union and/or Union's accountants as the Pre-
Closing Union Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of
reviewing the Closing Working Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of
Objections, _provided_ , that such access shall be during normal business
hours and in a manner that does not interfere with the normal business
operations of Union or the Group Companies.

 

(d) On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the Pre-Closing Union
Representative may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by
delivering to Union a written statement setting forth the Pre-Closing Union
Representative's objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed
item or amount and the basis for the Pre-Closing Union Representative's
disagreement therewith (the " _Statement of Objections_ "). If the Pre-Closing
Union Representative fails to deliver the Statement of Objections before the
expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working
Capital Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Pre-Closing
Union Representative. If the Pre-Closing Union Representative delivers the
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Union and
the Pre-Closing Union Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such objections within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Statement of
Objections (the " _Resolution Period_ "), and, if the same are so resolved
within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing
Working Capital Statement with such changes as may have been previously agreed
in writing by Union and the Pre-Closing Union Representative, shall be final
and binding.

 

(e) If the Pre-Closing Union Representative and Union fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts
remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ " and any amounts not so disputed,
the " _Undisputed Amounts_ ") shall be submitted for resolution to the office
of Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") and the Independent
Accountant who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the
Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment,
as the case may be, and the Closing Working Capital Statement. The Parties
hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality.
The Independent Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute
by the parties to such dispute and their decision for each Disputed Amount
must be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the Closing
Working Capital Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively.

   

(f) The Independent Accountant shall make a determination as soon as
practicable within thirty (30) days (or such other time as the parties in
dispute shall agree in writing) after their engagement, and their resolution
of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments to the Closing Working Capital
Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties hereto absent manifest error.

 

(g) Except as otherwise provided herein, any payment or satisfaction of the
Post-Closing Adjustment shall (A) be due (x) within ten (10) Business Days of
acceptance of or agreement on the applicable Closing Working Capital Statement
or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts, then within ten (10) Business Days of
the resolution described in clause (f) above; and (B) be paid or satisfied in
accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_.

 

(h) All fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant and of the Pre-Closing
Union Representative's accountants and Representatives shall be paid by Union
regardless of the Independent Accountant's determination in _Section 2.6(f)_.

 

Section 2.7. _Sale Restriction_.

 

Each of the Exchange Shares and Union Warrants issued to Bioceres in
connection with the Exchange shall be subject to certain restrictions on
transfer, in accordance with the terms of the Lock-Up Agreement (the " _Lock-
Up Agreement_ ") attached as _Exhibit D_ executed as of the date hereof and
effective as of the Closing Date. Certificates representing Exchange Shares
and Union Warrants issued as a result of the Exchange shall bear a prominent
legend to such effect.

 

Section 2.8. _Bioceres Semillas Tag Along_

 

Within five (5) days of the approval of the transactions contemplated herein

through one of its Affiliates, shall give notice of the transaction
contemplated herein to the minority shareholders of Bioceres Semillas in
accordance with the tag along provisions set forth in the Shareholders

Ordinary Shares redeemed prior to or concurrently with the Closing, (b) cash,
or (c) any combination of items (a) and (b). The value of such consideration

with the registration under the Securities Act of the Exchange Shares and

any comments made by Bioceres and their counsel. Union shall provide Bioceres

fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading or (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to holders of Union Ordinary Shares and at the time of
the Extraordinary General Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or

Union, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers is
discovered by either Party that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the holders of Union Ordinary Shares.

 

(e) Bioceres acknowledges that a substantial portion of the Registration

to, and agrees to cause the Group Companies to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Union with all
such information that is required or reasonably requested by Union to be

shareholders and Representatives of Bioceres and all other associates and
Affiliates, hereby waive all rights, title, interest or claim of any kind
against Union to collect from the Trust Account any monies that may be owed to
them by Union for any reason whatsoever, including a breach of this Agreement

directors, officers, shareholders and/or their respective affiliates to meet
its reasonable capital requirements, with any such loans to be made only as

bearing basis and repayable in cash at Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Union's directors, officers, shareholders and their respective Affiliates may

_Section 3.23(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

Section 9.3. _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

 

If any Proceeding is commenced or threatened or Losses are incurred that may
give rise to a claim for indemnification (an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") by
any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), then such Indemnified Party will promptly give notice
to the Indemnitor. The notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts
known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such Indemnification Claim and
the amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising therefrom. The failure
of the Indemnified Party to provide prompt notice of any Indemnification Claim
to the Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor of any Liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party except to the extent the defense of any such
Proceeding is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give
such notice. An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of any Proceeding subject to any such Indemnification
Claim with counsel of the Indemnitor's choice and to settle or compromise any
such Proceeding, and each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects
with the conduct of such defense by the Indemnitor and/or the settlement of
such Proceeding by the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnitor will not approve of the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to the Indemnification Claim without the
Indemnified Party's prior written approval (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless (a) there is no finding or admission of any
violation of Laws or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect
on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, (b) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnitor, and (c) there is an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party
from all Liability or obligation with respect to the claims asserted in such
Proceeding. If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of an
Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not, within sixty (60) days
after such notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of the Proceeding or Proceedings subject to
such Indemnification Claim, then the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense
of such Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party will
not approve of the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or
compromise with respect to the Indemnification Claim without the Indemnitor's
prior written approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
A claim for any matter not involving a Third Party may be asserted by written
notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any assertion of an Indemnification Claim shall be subject to
the limitations as to time set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 9.4. _Basket_.

 

Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the Union Indemnified
Parties shall only be entitled to recover for Losses pursuant to this _ARTICLE
9_ to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred by the Union
Indemnified Parties for which the Union Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification hereunder exceeds in the aggregate two million seven hundred
thousand U.S. Dollars ($2,700,000) (the " _Basket_ ") in which event the Union
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for the amount of
such Losses from the first dollar. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Basket
shall not apply to Losses with respect to claims for indemnification by the
Union Indemnified Parties arising directly or indirectly from or in connection
with (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any Bioceres Fundamental Representation,
(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, (c) _Section 9.2(iii)_ ,
_(iv)_ and _(v)_ , or (d) fraud, in which case, Bioceres and Parent will be
liable for all such Losses from the first dollar.

   

Section 9.5. _Other Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Any indemnification obligations of Bioceres and Parent hereunder shall
first be applied against the Escrow Shares and then against any other Escrow
Property. Any Escrow Shares or other Union Ordinary Share received by Union as
an indemnification payment shall be promptly cancelled by Union.

 

(b) The aggregate Liability of Bioceres and Parent to the Union Indemnified
Parties (i) for Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(i)_ shall not exceed twenty
million U.S. Dollars ($20,000,000) (the " _General Liability Cap_ ") and (ii)
for Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(iv)_ shall not exceed twenty-three million
U.S. Dollars ($23,000,000), provided that the Rizobacter Call Option is
exercised, or seventeen million three-hundred thousand U.S. Dollars
($17,300,000) in the event the Rizobacter Call Option is not exercised (in
each case, the " _Rizobacter Injunction Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the General Liability Cap shall not apply to Losses of the Union Indemnified
Parties arising directly or indirectly from or in connection with (A) any
breach or inaccuracy of any Bioceres Fundamental Representation, (B) any
breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant contained in this Agreement and (C)
_Sections 9.2(iii)_ and _(v)_ , or (d) fraud, _provided_ , _further_ ,
however, that the aggregate Liability of Bioceres and Parent to the Union
Indemnified Parties for Losses pursuant to subclauses (A) and (B) of the
foregoing proviso shall not exceed the value of the Exchange Shares at
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(iv)_
shall not be applied towards the General Liability Cap, which is reserved
solely for Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(i)_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon any
Indemnified Party becoming aware of any Indemnification Claim, such
Indemnified Party shall utilize all reasonable efforts, consistent with normal
practices and policies and good commercial practice, to mitigate such Losses.
For purposes of this _ARTICLE 9_ , all Losses shall be computed net of (i) any
insurance proceeds actually received, (ii) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party or any of its respective Affiliates from any Person with
respect to such Losses (whether under any agreement for indemnification,
contribution or otherwise) and (iii) the amount of any actual reduction in
Taxes payable, in each case, by the Indemnified Party (as applicable, or any
Affiliate thereof) that is attributable to the Losses to which such claim
relates, and with respect to clause (iii) in the taxable period in which such
Losses are incurred, treating any item of loss, deduction or credit as a
result of such Losses as the last item used in such period, and taking into
account any Tax detriment suffered by the Indemnified Party as a result of
such Losses and the receipt of the related indemnity payment (in the case of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), net of the cost and expense of obtaining any such
benefits, proceeds, payments or reimbursements). The Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue, and to cause their respective
Affiliates to pursue, all insurance claims, other third party payments and Tax
benefits to which it or they may be entitled in connection with any Losses
incurred. If any Indemnified Party actually receives any insurance or other
Third Party payment in connection with any claim for Losses for which it has
already received a payment under this _ARTICLE 9_ , it shall pay to the
Indemnitor within thirty (30) days after such payment is received, an amount
equal to the excess of (x) the amount previously received by such Indemnified
Party with respect to such claim plus the amount of such insurance or other
Third Party payment, less the costs of collection and, if insurance proceeds
are received, any increase in premiums directly caused by the receipt of such
insurance proceeds, over (y) the amount of Losses to which the Indemnitor has
become entitled under this Agreement in connection with such claim.

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the
purpose of calculating the amount of any Losses incurred as a result of any
breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, any qualification with respect to materiality or Bioceres Material
Adverse Effect or other similar qualification shall be deemed made or given
without such qualification and without giving effect to such words; provided
that the foregoing disapplication of qualifiers shall not apply to qualifiers
that define the scope of any scheduling or listing requirements of any
representation or warranty made by Bioceres in this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the materiality scrape in the foregoing sentence shall not
apply for purposes of determining whether there has a been a breach of any
representation or warranty under this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary set forth herein, the right
to indemnification, payment of Losses or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties or covenants will not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of
or compliance with, any such representation, warranty or covenant.

 

(f) IN NO EVENT WILL BIOCERES BE LIABLE FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT PAID TO A THIRD PARTY.

 

Section 9.6. _Adjustment to Consideration_.

 

Amounts paid for indemnification under this _ARTICLE 9_ shall be deemed to be
an adjustment to the consideration paid by Union to Bioceres for all income
tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 9.7. _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

From and after the Closing, indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
_ARTICLE 9_ shall be the sole and exclusive recourse and remedy of the Parties
with respect to any claim arising from this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether by contract, tort or otherwise, _provided_ ,
_however_ , the provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_ will not (a) limit a Party's
Liability for fraud, (b) restrict the right of any Party to seek specific
performance or other equitable remedies in connection with any breach of any
of the covenants contained in this Agreement, or (c) restrict the right of any
Party to pursue any remedies for claims specifically relating to or arising
under any agreement or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement that
may be available under or pursuant to such agreements and not relating to or
arising under this Agreement.

hereunder or related in any way to the foregoing, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal, substantive laws of the State of
New York applicable to agreements entered into and to be performed solely
within such state, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of
law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York.

 

Section 10.4. _Construction; Interpretation_.

 

The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
No Party, nor its respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this
Agreement for purposes of construing the provisions hereof, and all provisions
of this Agreement shall be construed according to their fair meaning and not
strictly for or against any Party. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary
herein by the context or use thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto,"
"hereof" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole,
including the Schedules, Exhibits and Annexes, and not to any particular
section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this
Agreement; (ii) masculine gender shall also include the feminine and neutral
genders, and vice versa; (iii) words importing the singular shall also include
the plural, and vice versa; (iv) references to a Person are also to its
successors and permitted assigns; (v) the word "extent" in the phrase of "to
the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends,
and such phrase shall not mean simply "if"; (vi) any reference to any month or
any day period shall mean the calendar month or the calendar day period unless
expressly specified otherwise; and (vii) whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they are deemed to be

Section 10.5. _Exhibits and Schedules_.

 

(a) All exhibits and Schedules, or documents expressly incorporated into this
Agreement (including the terms of the Exclusivity Agreement), are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set
out in full in this Agreement. Any item disclosed in any Schedule referenced
by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
disclosed with respect to every other section in this Agreement if the
relevance of such disclosure to such other sections is reasonably apparent on
its face. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement (or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 7.2(j)_ or _Section 7.3(e)_ , as the case may be) or the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is not intended to imply that
such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other
items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting
of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein
or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

    

Section 10.6. _Parties in Interest_.

 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
Party and its successors and permitted assigns and, except as provided herein,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this.

 

Section 10.7. _No Recourse Against Non-Party Affiliates_.

 

All claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract
or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based
upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or
relate in any manner to this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document (including any representation or warranty made in connection with, or
as an inducement to, this Agreement or any Ancillary Document), may be made
only against (and are those solely of) the entities that are expressly
identified as parties in the preamble to this Agreement. No Person who is not
a contracting party to this Agreement, including without limitation any
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
unitholder, shareholder, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or
representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any contracting
party to this Agreement, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, unitholder, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
or representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the
foregoing (" _Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any Liability (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any
claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of,
in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement
or any Ancillary Document or the negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach thereof; and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, each party to
this Agreement hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes
of action, and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Without
limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by law, (a) each party
to this Agreement hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims,
demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in
equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of any
party to this Agreement or otherwise impose Liability of a party to this
Agreement on any Non-Party Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on
theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination,
sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness,
undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each party to this Agreement
disclaims any reliance upon any Non-Party Affiliates with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any representation
or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement
or Ancillary Document.

    

Section 10.8. _Severability_.

 

Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in
such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any
term or other provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable under applicable Law, all other provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable under applicable Law, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
that any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Bioceres or of
Parent contained in this Agreement or the Schedules addresses a particular
issue with specificity, and no breach by Bioceres or Parent, as applicable,
exists under such specific provision, neither Bioceres nor Parent, as
applicable, shall be deemed to be in breach of any other provision of this
Agreement (with respect to such issue) that addresses such issue with less
specificity than such specific provision and if such specific provision is
qualified or limited by the Knowledge of Bioceres, or in any other manner, no
other provision shall supersede or limit such qualification in any manner.

 

Section 10.9. _Counterparts_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and
the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to
this Agreement by scanned pages or any other electronic means shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 

Section 10.10. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 

EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL
TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY
HEREBY FURTHER AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR
CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE
PARTIES MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE
OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

    

Section 10.11. _Jurisdiction and Venue_.

 

Each of the Parties (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in the State of New York, in any Proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of
such Proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court and (c) agrees
not to bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in
any other court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of any Proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or
other security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto.
Each Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process
that might be served in any Proceeding may be made on Union by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address of
the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section
10.2_. Nothing in this _Section 10.11_ , however, shall affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. Each
Party agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any Proceeding so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by law.

 

Section 10.12. _Liability of Pre-Closing Union Representative_.

 

(a) Union hereby irrevocably appoints the Pre-Closing Union Representative as
their exclusive representative, agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact (coupled
with an interest) for all purposes under this Agreement including the full
power and authority on the behalf of the Initial Holders: to (i) consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the matters described in _Section 2.6_
) and (ii) negotiate claims and disputes arising under, or relating to, this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the claims for indemnification under _ARTICLE 9_ ). The Pre-Closing Union
Representative shall have no duties or obligations hereunder, including any
fiduciary duties, except those set forth herein, and such duties and
obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document. Should the Pre-Closing Union
Representative resign or be unable to serve, a new Pre-Closing Union
Representative shall be selected by majority vote of the Initial Holders (each
voting in proportion to their respective economic interest in the Union
Ordinary Shares at the time of such vote.)

 

(b) The Pre-Closing Union Representative and its Non-Recourse Parties shall be
indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed by Union, against all costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid or incurred by the Pre-Closing Union Representative and its Non-Recourse
Parties in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which the
Pre-Closing Union Representative or such other Person is made a party by
reason of the fact that it is or was acting as the Pre-Closing Union
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, except in case of
fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Pre-Closing Union
Representative.

 

Section 10.13. _Specific Performance_.

 

Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that irreparable damage would occur
if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms, and that in the event of breach of this Agreement
by a Party, the non-breaching Party would not be adequately compensated in all
cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, after such time as the Parties
have agreed on the forms of each of the Ancillary Documents, in addition to
any other right or remedy to which the non-breaching Party may be entitled, it
shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of
specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of
this Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking.

    

Section 10.14. _Conflicts; Privilege_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective directors, members, shareholders, stockholders,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, as applicable, that:

 

(i) Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, Mitrani Caballero and Ruiz Moreno and
Graubard Miller (the " _Pre-Closing Union Group Law Firms_ ") have acted as
counsel to Union, the holders of Union Ordinary Shares and the Union
Representative (individually and collectively, the " _Union Group_ "), in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the applicable Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Parent and Bioceres agree, and
shall cause the Group Companies to agree, that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, such representation and any prior
representation of Union by the Pre-Closing Union Group Law Firms, or any
successors thereto, shall not preclude the Pre-Closing Union Group Law Firms
from serving as counsel to the Union Group or any director, member,
shareholder, stockholder, partner, officer or employee of the Union Group, in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Parent nor
Bioceres shall, and each shall cause the Group Companies not to, seek to or
have the Pre-Closing Union Group Law Firms disqualified from any such
representation based upon the prior representation of Union by the Pre-Closing
Union Group Law Firms. The parties hereto hereby consent thereto and waive any
potential conflict of interest arising from such prior representation, and
each of such parties shall cause any of their respective Affiliates to consent
to waive any potential conflict of interest arising from such representation.
Each of the parties acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary,
that it has been carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted
with counsel or have been advised they should do so in connection herewith.

    

(ii) Linklaters LLP and Marval O'Farral and Mairal (" _Bioceres Group Law Firms_
") have acted as counsel to Parent, Bioceres and the Group Companies
(individually and collectively, the " _Bioceres Group_ "), in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
applicable Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Union agrees, and shall cause the Group
Companies to agree, that, following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, such representation and any prior representation of the
Group Companies by the Bioceres Group Law Firms shall not preclude the
Bioceres Group Law Firms from serving as counsel to the Bioceres Group or any
director, member, shareholder, partner, officer or employee of the Bioceres
Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Union
shall not, and shall cause the Group Companies not to, seek or have the
Bioceres Group Law Firms disqualified from any such representation based upon
the prior representation of the Group Companies by the Bioceres Group Law
Firms. Each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and waives any
potential conflict of interest arising from such prior representation, and
each of such parties shall cause any of its Affiliates to consent to waive any
potential conflict of interest arising from such representation. Each of the
parties acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has
been carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted with counsel or
have been advised they should do so in connection herewith.

 

(iii) The covenants, consents and waivers contained in this _Section 10.14_
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Pre-Closing
Union Group Law Firms or the Pre-Closing Bioceres Group Law Firms are entitled
whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

 

(b) All communications between the Pre-Closing Union Group, on the one hand,
and Pre-Closing Union Group Law Firms, on the other hand, relating to the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Union Privileged
Communications_ ") and all communications between the Bioceres Group, on the
one hand, and Bioceres Group Law Firms, on the other hand, relating to the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Bioceres
Privileged Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be attorney-client privileged
and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely
to the Pre-Closing Union Group and the Bioceres Group, as applicable, and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, Bioceres or any Group Company (in
the case of Union Privilege Communication) or the pre-Closing Union (in the
case of Bioceres Privileged Communication). Accordingly, Parent, Bioceres and
the Group Companies shall not have access to any Union Privileged
Communications or to the files of the Pre-Closing Union Group Law Firms and
Union shall not have access to the Bioceres Privileged Communications or to
the files of the Bioceres Group Law Firms relating to the engagement of the
Pre-Closing Union Group Law Firms by the Union Group and the Bioceres Group
Law Firms by the Bioceres Group, as applicable, from and after Closing.

    

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the
Closing, (i) (A) the Pre-Closing Union Group (and not Parent, Bioceres or any
Group Company) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to the engagement of the Pre-Closing Union Group Law Firms, and none
of Parent, Bioceres or any Group Company shall be a holder thereof and (B) the
Bioceres Group (and not Union or the Group Companies) shall be the sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the engagement of the
Bioceres Group Law Firms, and none of Union or any Group Company shall be a
holder thereof, (ii) (A) to the extent that files of the Pre-Closing Union
Group Law Firms in respect of their engagement by the Pre-Closing Union Group
constitute property of the client, only the Pre-Closing Union Group (and not
Parent, Bioceres nor any Group Company) shall hold such property rights and
(B) to the extent that files of Bioceres Group Law Firm in respect of their
engagement by the Bioceres Group constitute property of the client, only the
Bioceres Group (and not Union nor any Group Company) shall hold such property
rights and (iii) (A) the Pre-Closing Union Group Law Firms shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to Parent, Bioceres or any Group Company by reason of any attorney-
client relationship between the Pre-Closing Union Group Law Firms and Union or
otherwise and (B) the Bioceres Group Law Firms shall have no duty whatsoever
to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to
Union or any Group Company by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between the Bioceres Group Law Firms and the Group Companies or otherwise.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Union or its Affiliates (including any Group Company), on the one hand, and a
third party other than any of the Bioceres Group, on the other hand, Union and
its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third
party; _provided, however_ , that neither Union nor any of its Affiliates
(including any Group Company) may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of Bioceres, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In the event that Union or any of its Affiliates
(including any Group Company) is legally required by order of a Governmental
Entity or otherwise legally required to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Bioceres Privileged Communications, to the extent (x) permitted
by applicable Law, and (y) advisable in the opinion of Union's counsel, then
Union shall immediately (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days)
notify Bioceres in writing so that Bioceres can seek a protective order.

 

(e) This _Section 10.14_ is intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Union Group and the Bioceres Group. This _Section 10.14_
shall be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 10.14_ may be amended,
waived or modified, without the prior written consent of the Pre-Closing Union
Group Law Firms or Bioceres Group Law Firms, as applicable. _[SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]_

    

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has caused this Agreement to be duly
executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above written.

ESCROW AGREEMENT

 

This ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
__________________, by and among: (i) UNION ACQUISITION CORP., an exempted
company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, which will be known
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange
Agreement (as defined herein) as "Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp." (including
any successor entity thereto, " _Union_ "), solely in respect of its
obligations under _Section 13_ of this Agreement (ii) Joseph J. Schena, in the
capacity as the Union Representative under the Share Exchange Agreement (as
defined herein) (including any successor Union Representative appointed
pursuant to and in accordance therewith, the " _Union Representative_ _"_ );
(iii) BIOCERES S.A., a _sociedad an onima _formed under the laws of the
Republic of Argentina (" _Parent_ "); (iv) BIOCERES LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Bioceres_ "); and (v) Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). Capitalized terms used
herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given to such
terms in the Share Exchange Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, on November 8, 2018, Union, the Union Representative and Bioceres
entered into that certain Share Exchange Agreement (as amended from time to
time in accordance with the terms thereof, the " _Share Exchange Agreement_
"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Union
will (i) acquire from Parent all of Parent's equity interest in Bioceres
Semillas S.A., representing 87.2739% of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Bioceres Semillas S.A. and (ii) acquire from Bioceres all of
Bioceres' issued and outstanding equity interests of New Bioceres, Inc.,
representing 100% of New Bioceres, Inc. in exchange for (A) newly issued
Union Ordinary Shares, subject to the withholding of the Escrow Shares (as
defined below) being deposited into the Escrow Account (as defined below) in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement and
this Agreement and (B) the Union Warrants;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Union and its Affiliates
(other than Bioceres and Parent) and their respective Representatives,
successors and assigns, as the case may be (the " _Union Indemnified Parties_
") are entitled to be indemnified in certain respects, jointly and severally,
by Bioceres and Parent;

 

WHEREAS, in accordance with the Share Exchange Agreement and this Agreement,
at the Closing, Union shall issue to the Escrow Agent five percent (5%) of
the Exchange Shares (together with any equity securities paid as dividends or
distributions with respect to such shares or into which such shares are
exchanged or converted, the " _Escrow Shares_ ") to be held, along with any
other Escrow Property (as defined below), by the Escrow Agent in a segregated
escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ", and as reduced by any disbursements
of such Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Share Exchange Agreement,
the " _Escrow Property_ ") and disbursed therefrom in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and _Section 2.4_ of the Share Exchange Agreement; 

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Union Representative
has been exclusively designated to act on behalf of Union to take all
necessary actions and make all decisions pursuant to this Agreement; and  

WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent is willing to administer the escrow under the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

 

Section 1. _Appointment_. Bioceres and the Union Representative hereby appoint
the Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and
the Escrow Agent hereby agrees to perform the duties of their escrow agent
under this Agreement. The escrow services to be rendered by the Escrow Agent
under this Agreement will not begin until the Escrow Agent has received the
documentation necessary to establish the Escrow Account on its books and has
received the Escrow Shares in accordance with this Agreement.

 

Section 2. _Delivery of Escrow Shares_. Pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ of the
Share Exchange Agreement, on the Closing Date, Union shall, in cooperation
with the Escrow Agent and Union's transfer agent, transfer the Escrow Shares
to the Escrow Agent in book entry form.

 

Section 3. _Maintenance of the Escrow Shares and other Escrow Property_.
During the term of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow
Property in the Escrow Account and shall not sell, transfer, dispose of, lend
or otherwise subject to a Lien any of the Escrow Property except until and to
the extent that they are disbursed in accordance with _Section 4_. Except as
Bioceres and the Union Representative may otherwise agree in joint written
instructions executed and delivered to the Escrow Agent, no part of the Escrow
Property may be withdrawn except as expressly provided in this Agreement.
While the Escrow Shares are held in the Escrow Account, Bioceres shall have
the right to vote the Escrow Shares.

 

Section 4. _Delivery of the Escrow Property_. The Escrow Agent shall hold the
Escrow Property and shall deliver the Escrow Property to either Union or
Bioceres, as applicable, in accordance with the following procedures:

 

(a) At any time and from time to time after the date hereof but no later than
the Escrow Release Date, the Union Representative may assert a claim for
indemnification on behalf of a Union Indemnified Party pursuant to the Share
Exchange Agreement (an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") by providing prompt
written notice (as the same may be amended or modified as set forth herein, "
_Claim Notice_ ") of such claim to Bioceres and the Escrow Agent, which Claim
Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the Union
Indemnified Party giving rise to such Indemnification Claim and the amount or
good faith estimate of the amount arising therefrom (the " _Claim Amount_ ").
The Union Representative may, at any time supplement an outstanding Claim
Notice, including by way of establishing, increasing or reducing the Claim
Amount with respect thereto, by delivering such supplement to the Escrow
Agent, with a contemporaneous copy to Bioceres.  

(b) Unless Bioceres (on behalf of itself and Parent, as applicable) provides
to the Union Representative and the Escrow Agent a written notice objecting to
such Indemnification Claim (an " _Objection Notice_ "), which Objection Notice
shall provide a description, in reasonable detail, of the facts upon which
such objection is based, by 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the thirtieth
(30th) day after the date of delivery of the Claim Notice (the date of the
delivery of the Claim Notice through such time, the " _Objection Period_ "),
Bioceres and/or Parent, as applicable, will be deemed to have accepted
responsibility for the Losses set forth in such Claim Notice and will have no
further right to contest the validity of such Claim Notice, and the Escrow
Agent shall promptly (in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the
expiration of the Objection Period disburse to Union Escrow Property from the
Escrow Account in an amount equal to the Claim Amount. If Bioceres provides an
Objection Notice during the Objection Period that disputes only a portion of
the Claim Amount, the Escrow Agent shall promptly (in any event within five
(5) Business Days) after the expiration of the Objection Period disburse to
Union Escrow Property from the Escrow Account in an amount equal to the
undisputed portion of the Claim Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
during the Objection Period, Bioceres provides affirmative written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to release Escrow Property from the Escrow
Account in an amount equal to the Claim Amount or undisputed portion of the
Claim Amount, as applicable, the Escrow Agent shall promptly (in any event
within five (5) Business Days) after the Escrow Agent's receipt of such
instructions from Bioceres, disburse to Union such Escrow Property from the
Escrow Account as instructed.

 

(c) If Bioceres timely disputes an Indemnification Claim by providing an
Objection Notice to the Union Representative and the Escrow Agent during the
Objection Period, the Escrow Agent shall not distribute to Bioceres any
portion of the Escrow Property with respect to the disputed portion of the
Claim Amount, until receipt of (i) joint written instructions executed and
delivered by Bioceres and the Union Representative stating that the dispute
has been resolved and that Union Indemnified Party has the right to the Claim
Amount (or some portion thereof) (" _Joint Instructions_ ") or (ii) a copy of
an arbitration award or a court order from a court of competent jurisdiction
establishing the Union Indemnified Party's right to the Claim Amount (or some
portion thereof) pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement (a " _Binding Award_
"). Upon receipt of such Joint Instructions or Binding Award, the Escrow Agent
shall, without further action on the part of Bioceres or the Union
Representative, promptly (in any event within five (5) Business Days) disburse
to Union the Escrow Property from the Escrow Account in the amount set forth
in the Joint Instructions or the Binding Award, as applicable.

 

(d) Payments from the Escrow Account with respect to any Indemnification
Claims shall first be paid with the Escrow Shares and then with any remaining
property in the Escrow Account. For any Escrow Shares to be disbursed with
respect to Indemnification Claims, the Escrow Shares shall be valued as of the
date that an Indemnification Claim is finally determined in accordance with
the Share Exchange Agreement and this Agreement (the " _Resolution Date_ ").
For the avoidance of doubt, the Resolution Date shall be (i) if no Objection
Notice is delivered by Bioceres during the Objection Period, the thirty-first
(31) day after the date that the Claim Notice is delivered; (ii) if prior to
the date described in clause (i) above, Bioceres provides affirmative written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Property for the amount
set forth in the Claim Notice, the date that the Escrow Agent receives such
written instructions; (iii) if Bioceres provides an Objection Notice during
the Objection Period that disputes only a portion of the Claim Amount with
respect to the undisputed portion of such Claim Amount, the date that the
Escrow Agent receives such Objection Notice and (iv) with respect to any
disputed Claim Amount, either the date that the Escrow Agent receives Joint
Instructions or a Binding Award.  

(e) With respect to any Indemnification Claims made in accordance with the
Share Exchange Agreement and this Agreement on or prior to the Escrow Release
Date that remain unresolved at the time of the Escrow Release Date (" _Pending
Claims_ "), all or a portion of the Escrow Property reasonably necessary to
satisfy such Pending Claims (as determined based on (i) the Claim Amount
included in the Claim Notice (as it may be adjusted) provided by the Union
Representative and (ii) the value of the Escrow Shares as of the Escrow
Release Date), shall remain in the Escrow Account until such Pending Claim has
been finally resolved pursuant to the provisions of the Share Exchange
Agreement and this Agreement. After the Escrow Release Date, any Escrow
Property remaining in the Escrow Account that is not subject to Pending
Claims, if any, and not subject to resolved but unpaid claims in favor of an
Indemnified Party, shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to Bioceres.
Promptly after the final resolution of all Pending Claims and the payment of
all indemnification obligations in connection therewith, the Escrow Agent
shall disburse any Escrow Property remaining in the Escrow Account to
Bioceres.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Escrow Property shall be
distributed and released pursuant to Joint Instructions to pay a specified
amount to Union to cover the costs and expenses of any defense and any payment
in respect of any settlement of any Proceeding that is subject to an
Indemnification Claim that is assumed by the Union Representative (on behalf
of Union) pursuant to _Section 9.3_ of the Share Exchange Agreement and (ii)
all interest, earnings or income, if any, earned with respect to the Escrow
Property while held by the Escrow Agent shall be distributed to Bioceres by
the Escrow Agent within ten (10) days of the end of each calendar quarter.

 

(g) Any amount of Escrow Property required to be transferred to any Person
pursuant to this _Section 4_ shall be transferred by the Escrow Agent pursuant
to such delivery instructions as provided by the Union Representative or
Bioceres. The Escrow Agent shall rely exclusively on instructions provided by
Union Representative and Bioceres as to the amount and recipient of any
distribution of Escrow Property pursuant to this _Section 4_ , or the relevant
order of any court of competent jurisdiction or other award granted pursuant
to other binding legal process (including any binding arbitration). The Escrow
Agent has no duty or responsibility to calculate any distribution or to
confirm the accuracy of any distribution amount so instructed.

 

Section 5. _Tax Matters_. Union, the Union Representative and Bioceres agree
and acknowledge that, for all U.S. and foreign tax purposes, except as
required by applicable Law, Bioceres shall be treated as the owner of the
Escrow Property while held in the Escrow Account and until released to
Bioceres, and all interest, earnings or income, if any, earned with respect to
the Escrow Property while held by the Escrow Agent shall be treated as earned
by Bioceres and shall be distributed in accordance with Section 4(f) hereof.
The Escrow Agent shall have the right to deduct and withhold taxes from any
payments to be made hereunder if such withholding is required by law and to
request and receive any necessary tax forms from the applicable recipient of
the Escrow Property.  

Section 6. _Duties_. The Escrow Agent's duties are entirely ministerial and
not discretionary, and the Escrow Agent will be under no duty or obligation to
do or to omit the doing of any action with respect to the Escrow Property,
except to give notice, provide monthly reports, make disbursements, keep an
accurate record of all transactions with respect to the Escrow Property, hold
the Escrow Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to
comply with any other duties expressly set forth in this Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall not have any interest in the Escrow Property but shall serve as
escrow holder only and have only possession thereof. Nothing contained herein
shall be construed to create any obligation or liability whatsoever on the
part of the Escrow Agent to anyone other than the parties to this Agreement.
There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.

 

Section 7. _Determination of the Value of the Escrow Shares_. In the event
that the Escrow Agent has any question as to the value of the Escrow Shares,
Bioceres and the Union Representative shall cooperate to promptly provide the
Escrow Agent with their good faith determination of the value of the Escrow
Shares pursuant to Joint Instructions or a Binding Award (and in the event of
any dispute as to the value of the Escrow Shares, the Escrow Agent shall not
disburse the applicable Escrow Property until such dispute has been resolved).

 

Section 8. _Monthly Reports Upon Request_. The Escrow Agent shall provide
monthly account statements to the Union Representative and Bioceres with
respect to the Escrow Account. The Union Representative and Bioceres have one
hundred twenty (120) days to object in writing to such reports. If no written
notice detailing a party's objections has been received by the Escrow Agent
within this period, an acceptance of such reports shall be deemed to have
occurred.

 

Section 9. _Authorized Parties; Reliance_. The parties hereby acknowledge that
the Union Representative has the sole and exclusive authorization to act on
behalf of Union under this Agreement. The Union Representative and Bioceres
agree to provide, on _Exhibit A_ (as it may be amended from time to time) to
this Agreement, the names and specimen signatures of those persons who are
authorized to issue notices and instructions to the Escrow Agent and execute
required documents under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent may rely and shall
be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any written notice,
instruction or request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Escrow Agent is entitled to rely on, and shall be fully protected in
relying on, the instructions and notices from any one of the authorized
signers, as identified on the attached _Exhibit A_ (as it may be amended from
time to time) to this Agreement, from each of the Union Representative and
Bioceres, either acting alone, until such time as their authority is revoked
in writing, or until successors have been appointed and identified by notice
in the manner described in _Section 15_ below.

 

Section 10. _Good Faith_. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action
taken by it in good faith and reasonably believed by it to be authorized or
within the rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement and may
consult with counsel of its own choice and shall have full and complete
authorization and protection for any action taken or suffered by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel.

 

Section 11. _Right to Resign_. The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged
from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving such notice in writing of
such resignation specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect,
which shall be a date not less than sixty (60) days after the date of the
notice of such resignation. Similarly, the Escrow Agent may be removed and
replaced following the giving of thirty (30) days' notice to the Escrow Agent
by all of the other parties hereto. In either event, the Union Representative
and Bioceres shall agree upon a successor escrow agent. If the Union
Representative and Bioceres are unable to agree upon a successor or shall have
failed to appoint a successor prior to the expiration of sixty (60) days
following the date of resignation or thirty (30) days following the date of
removal, the then-acting escrow agent may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or otherwise
appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon
all of the parties hereto. Any successor escrow agent shall execute and
deliver to the predecessor escrow agent, the Union Representative and Bioceres
an instrument accepting such appointment and the transfer of the Escrow
Property and agreeing to the terms of this Agreement.  

Section 12. _Compensation_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive the
fees as set forth on _Exhibit B_ for the services to be rendered hereunder,
and to be paid or reimbursed for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket
expenses, disbursements and advances, including reasonable documented out-of-
pocket attorneys' fees, incurred or paid in connection with carrying out its
duties hereunder, such amounts to be paid by Union.

 

Section 13. _Indemnification_. Each of Bioceres and Union hereby agrees to
jointly and severally indemnify the Escrow Agent for, and to hold it harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent, arising out of or in
connection with its entering into this Agreement and carrying out its duties
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as between Bioceres and Union, each
of Bioceres and Union, between themselves, shall be responsible for one-half
(1/2) of such indemnification obligations, and each of Bioceres and the Union
Representative shall have the right to seek contribution from Bioceres or
Union, as applicable, to the extent that it pays for more than one-half (1/2)
of such indemnification obligations.

 

Section 14. _Disputes_. If a controversy arises between the parties hereto as
to whether or not or to whom the Escrow Agent shall transfer all or any
portion of the Escrow Property or as to any other matter arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Property, the Escrow Agent shall not
be required to determine the same, shall not make any transfer of and shall
retain the Escrow Property in dispute without liability to anyone until the
rights of the parties to the dispute shall have finally been determined by
mutual written agreement of Bioceres and the Union Representative, or by a
final non-appealable judgment or order of any state or federal court located
in New York County, New York (or in any court in which appeal from such courts
may be taken) but the Escrow Agent shall be under no duty whatsoever to
institute or defend any such proceedings. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to assume that no such controversy has arisen unless it has received notice of
such controversy or conflicting written notices from the parties to this
Agreement. Any disputes arising out of, related to, or in connection with,
this Agreement between Bioceres and the Union Representative, including a
dispute arising from a party's failure or refusal to sign a joint written
notice hereunder, shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 10.3_ of the Share Exchange Agreement.  

Section 15. _Notices_. Except to the extent expressly set forth herein, all
notices and communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed
to be given if (a) delivered personally, (b) sent by facsimile or email (with
affirmative confirmation of receipt), (c) sent by recognized overnight courier

RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL AGREEMENT

 

THIS RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of
________________ by and among Bioceres S.A., a _sociedad an onima _organized
under the laws of the Republic of Argentina (together with its permitted
successors and assigns, the "Parent"), and the investors listed on Schedule 1
hereto (the "Union Investors", and together with Parent, collectively, the
"Parties" and individually, a "Party"). Any capitalized term used but not
defined in this Agreement will have the meaning ascribed to such term in that
certain Share Exchange Agreement (as amended from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof, the "Share Exchange Agreement"), by and among Union
Acquisition Corp. ("Union"), Joseph J. Schena, in his capacity under the Share
Exchange Agreement as the Pre-Closing Union Representative (including any
successor Pre-Closing Union Representative appointed in accordance therewith,
the "Pre-Closing Union Representative") and Bioceres, Inc., a Delaware
Corporation ("Bioceres").

 

WHEREAS, on November 8, 2018, Union, the Pre-Closing Union Representative and
Bioceres entered into the Share Exchange Agreement pursuant to which, subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, Union will (i) acquire from Parent all of
Parent's equity interest in Bioceres Semillas S.A., a _sociedad an onima
_organized under the laws of the Republic of Argentina, representing 87.2739%
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Bioceres Semillas S.A. and (ii)
acquire from Bioceres all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of
New Bioceres, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in exchange for (A) twenty-seven
million, one hundred sixteen thousand, one hundred seventy-four (27,116,174)
newly issued Union Ordinary Shares, a portion of which will be set aside in
escrow and held in an escrow account in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and (B)
the Union Warrants;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, and in view of the valuable
consideration to be received by the Parties thereunder, the Parties hereto
desire to enter into this Agreement, pursuant to which Parent shall be granted
a right of first refusal to purchase from any Union Investor any and all Union
Ordinary Shares held by such Union Investor (including shares issuable upon
the exercise of any option, warrant or other right to acquire Union Ordinary
Shares), prior to such Union Investor's sale, transfer or other disposition of
such shares (a "Transfer") to an unaffiliated third party (a "Third Party
Buyer").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as
follows:

 

     1  |   

 Right of First Refusal of Parent. 

---|--- 
     | 
     |   (a)  |   

If any Union Investor (the "Selling Investor") receives from or wishes to
present to a Third Party Buyer, a bona fide offer for the Transfer of any or
all of such Selling Investor's Union Ordinary Shares, prior to accepting such
offer, such Selling Investor shall first offer to sell such Union Ordinary
Shares to Parent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the "Parent
Right of First Refusal").   
 

       | (b)  |   

 In the event a bona fide offer is received by or presented to a Selling
Investor, such Selling Investor shall deliver a written notice of such bona
fide offer (a "Transfer Notice") to Parent, describing in reasonable detail
the Union Ordinary Shares proposed to be sold, the name of the Third Party
Buyer, the price offered per each Union Ordinary Share, the payment terms and
all other material terms of the proposed Transfer. Upon receipt of a Transfer
Notice, Parent shall have the right and option for thirty (30) days from the
date of the Transfer Notice, to deliver a written notice to the Selling
Investor (a "Response Notice") stating whether or not Parent wishes to
purchase all or any part of the Union Ordinary Shares proposed to be
transferred by the Selling Investor at the Purchase Price (as defined below)
and on the other terms of the proposed Transfer set forth in the Transfer
Notice. 

---|---|--- 
      |   | 
     | (c)  |  

If Parent states in any Response Notice that it wishes to purchase all or any
part of the Union Ordinary Share proposed to be transferred by the Selling
Investor, the exercise price granted to Parent for such Union Ordinary Shares
(the "Purchase Price") shall be equal to the highest weighted average trading
price for any five (5) consecutive trading days selected from the twenty (20)
trading days immediately prior to the date of the applicable Response Notice. 

     |   | 
     | (d)  |  

Absent the delivery of a Response Notice to the Selling Investor within the
thirty (30) day period following receipt of the Transfer Notice, Parent shall
be deemed to have waived the Parent Right of First Refusal. 

     |   | 
     | (e)  |   

If Parent elects to purchase all or any part of the offered Union Ordinary
Shares, the closing of the purchase and sale of such Union Ordinary Shares
shall be held at the place and on the date established in the Response Notice,
which in no event shall be less than ten (10) or more than forty-five (45)
days from the date of such Response Notice. In any case where any aspect of
the terms of such offer depends on the unique attributes of the Third Party
Buyer or otherwise cannot be precisely and reasonably duplicated by someone
other than the Third Party Buyer, purchases by Parent shall be made on terms
that constitute the reasonable economic equivalent of the terms of such bona
fide offer, as determined by the board of directors of Union in good faith. 

     |   | 
     | (f)  |   

In the event that Parent does not elect to purchase all Union Ordinary Shares
offered in a Transfer Notice, the Selling Investor may, subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, sell the portion of the offered Union Ordinary
Shares not purchased by Parent to the Third Party Buyer specified in such
Transfer Notice at a price no less than the price specified in such Transfer
Notice and on other terms no more favorable to the Third Party Buyer than
specified in such Transfer Notice. In the event that any of the offered Union
Ordinary Shares are not transferred to the applicable Third Party Buyer
specified in the Transfer Notice within forty-five (45) days immediately
following the last day on which Parent could have elected to purchase the
offered Union Ordinary Shares, any subsequent Transfer of such shares shall
once again be offered to Parent in accordance with Section 1 of this
Agreement.

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Union, the Pre-Closing Union Representative
and Holder entered into Share Exchange Agreement pursuant to which, subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, Union will acquire from Holder, among other

subject to limitations on disposition as set forth herein.

   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated into this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Lock-Up Provisions_.

 

(a) Holder hereby agrees not to, until the earlier of (A) the earlier of (x)
one (1) year after the Closing of the transactions contemplated by the Share
Exchange Agreement and (y) the date on which the closing price of Union's

Closing Union Representative an agreement stating that the transferee is
receiving and holding the Restricted Securities subject to the provisions of
this Agreement applicable to Holder, and there shall be no further transfer of
such Restricted Securities except in accordance with this Agreement and (y)
such transfer shall not reduce Holder's ownership of Union Ordinary Shares to
an amount that is below fifty one percent (51%) of the then outstanding Union
Ordinary Shares. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Permitted Transferee_
" shall mean: (I) if Holder is an individual, the members of Holder's

individual, any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of Holder or the
immediate family of Holder, (III) if Holder is a trust, to the trustor or

Agreement and (VII) any Person selling shares of Rizobacter S.A. pursuant to
the exercise of the Rizobacter Call Option (as defined in the Share Exchange
Agreement) as consideration thereunder, in accordance with Section 6.25 of the
Share Exchange Agreement. Holder further agrees to execute such agreements as
may be reasonably requested by Union or the Pre-Closing Union Representative
that are consistent with the foregoing or that are necessary to give further
effect thereto.

   

(b) Holder further acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be permitted to
engage in any Prohibited Transfer with respect to any Escrow Shares until such
Escrow Shares are disbursed to Holder from the Escrow Account in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holder may during the Lock-Up Period pledge

third party lender as a guarantee to secure borrowings by Union or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that, it shall be a condition to any such pledge
and related guarantee that the applicable lender executes and delivers to
Union and the Pre-Closing Union Representative an agreement stating that the

of the Restricted Securities as one of its equity holders for any purpose. In
order to enforce this _Section 1_ , Union may impose stop-transfer
instructions with respect to the Restricted Securities of Holder (and
permitted transferees and assigns thereof) until the end of the Lock-Up
Period.

 

(e) During the Lock-Up Period (and with respect to any Escrow Shares, during

Representative hereunder.

 

(c) _Third Parties_. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any instrument
or document executed by any party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall create any rights in, or be deemed to have been
executed for the benefit of, any person or entity that is not a party hereto
or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a party.

 

(d) _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute
arising under or related in any way to this Agreement, the relationship of the

other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

and complaint or any other process that might be served in any Proceeding may
be made on Union by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party
to be served at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this _Section 2(e)_ , however,
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner

any Proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR

EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY FURTHER AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY
SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL
WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

(i) _Amendments and Waivers_. Any term of this Agreement may be amended and
the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally
or in a particular instance, and either retroactively or prospectively) only
with the written consent of the Pre-Closing Union Representative and Holder.
No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof. No waivers of or exceptions to any term, condition, or
provision of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to
be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such term, condition,
or provision.

 

(j) _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement is held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, all other provisions
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

(k) _Specific Performance_. Holder acknowledges that its obligations under
this Agreement are unique, recognizes and affirms that in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by Holder, money damages will be inadequate and Union
(and the Pre-Closing Union Representative on behalf of Union) will have no
adequate remedy at law, and agrees that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
Holder in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each of Union and the Pre-Closing Union Representative shall be
entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this
Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking.

   

(l) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the full and entire
understanding and agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and any other written or oral agreement relating to the subject
matter hereof existing between the parties is expressly canceled; _provided_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not affect the rights
and obligations of the parties under the Share Exchange Agreement or any
Ancillary Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit any of the rights or remedies of Union and the Pre-Closing Union
Representative or any of the obligations of Holder under any other agreement
between Holder and Union or the Pre-Closing Union Representative or any
certificate or instrument executed by Holder in favor of Union or the Pre-
Closing Union Representative, and nothing in any other agreement, certificate
or instrument shall limit any of the rights or remedies of Union or the Pre-
Closing Union Representative or any of the obligations of Holder under this
Agreement.

 

(m) _Further Assurances_. From time to time, at another party's request and
without further consideration (but at the requesting party's reasonable cost
and expense), each party shall execute and deliver such additional documents
and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(n) _Counterparts; Facsimile_. This Agreement may also be executed and
delivered by facsimile signature or by email in portable document format in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Option I and the Call Option II on the Shares Subject to Option II, under the
terms set forth herein.

collection, as set forth in Section 4.2 (i). Otherwise, if before March 31,
2019 the Closing of the _Proyecto Harvest_ has occurred, Call Option I shall
lapse in its entirety and, therefore, Buyer and/or its Affiliates shall only

the Closing of _Proyecto Harvest_.

as applicable, upon the expiration of the Terms of Exercise of Options I and
II, respectively (the "Put Options I and II"). All the financial terms
established herein will be applied to Put Options I and II. For greater
clarity, once the Put Option I or II has been exercised, as the case may be
and as agreed in this Proposed Addendum, the Buyer shall be obliged to acquire
the Shares Subject to the various Call Options I or II, as the case may be,
owned by IPS, PMM and MMM in accordance with the terms agreed upon under this
Proposal.

  

 _THIRD_ : _CALL OPTION II_

  

3.1 The Buyer (and/or any of its Affiliates) may exercise Call Option II on
the Shares Subject to Option II by giving the Sellers Notice of Exercise of
the Call Option.

  

3.2 Given by the Buyer (and/or any of its Affiliates) the Notice of Exercise

from the date of receipt of the last of the notices: (i) the Parties shall
complete the purchase and sale of the Shares Subject to Option II; (ii) the

conditions of the Appendix I to the Call Option Offer.

  

 _FOURTH_ : _PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION II_

  

4.1 The price of the Shares Subject to Option II (the " _Purchase Price II_ ")
will be USD 49,980,000 (forty-nine million nine hundred and eighty thousand
U.S. Dollars), of which USD 22,020,000 (twenty-two million twenty thousand

hundred and eighty thousand US Dollars) correspond to PMM; and (iii) USD
13,980,000 (thirteen million nine hundred and eighty thousand US Dollars)
correspond to PMM.

  

4.2 Buyer (and/or any of its Affiliates) shall pay Purchase Price II on the
Closing Date by payment to Sellers of: (i) the sum of USD 14,985,000 (fourteen
million nine hundred and eighty-five thousand U.S. Dollars) to Sellers'
proprietary accounts as indicated by Sellers in writing to Buyer (and/or any
of its Affiliates) payable in full and/or by way of advances, at Buyer's
discretion, prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) payment in UAC Shares
equivalent to USD 34,995,000 (thirty-four million nine hundred and ninety-five
thousand U.S. dollars); all in accordance with the proportions corresponding
to the Sellers indicated in _Appendix 4.2_ hereof. Likewise, the Parties agree
that in the event that the Closing of _Proyecto Harvest_ does not occur as of
March 31, 2019, any type of advances that may have been received in such
respect shall be discounted from the Purchase Price of Option I.

  

4.3. Without prejudice to the proportions of payment of Purchase Price II set
forth in 4.2 (i) and (ii), the Buyer (and/or any of its Affiliates) shall have

Price II by delivery to the Sellers of greater or lesser quantity of cash
and/or UAC Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in all cases, the Buyer
(and/or any of its Affiliates) shall make payments in cash or in kind, as the
case may be, on a _pro rata_ basis among the Sellers in accordance with their
shareholdings and communicate such circumstance in the Notice of Exercise of
the Call Option.

Price II by payment in kind of an amount greater than the equivalent of USD
34,995,000 (thirty-four million nine hundred and ninety-five thousand U.S.
Dollars, ) in UAC Shares, then the Sellers will have an irrevocable put option
whereby the Sellers will have the right to sell and the Buyer (and/or any of
its Affiliates) will be obligated to purchase from the Sellers the quantity of
UAC Shares delivered in excess of the Purchase Price II set forth in Clause
4.2(ii), all on the terms of _Appendix 4.4_ hereof. Shares Subject to the
Irrevocable Put Option under the terms of Appendix 4.4 shall be exempt from
any transfer limitation and from the exercise of the Option as well as from
the pledge agreed in Appendix 4.6.

     

4.5 If, on the contrary, Buyer (and/or any of its Affiliates) chooses to pay
Sellers the Purchase Price II in cash in an amount greater than USD 14,985,000
(fourteen million nine hundred and eighty-five thousand U.S. Dollars), then
Sellers will grant Buyer (and/or its Affiliates) an irrevocable put option
under which Buyer (and/or any of its Affiliates) will have the right to sell
and Sellers will be obligated to purchase from Buyer (and/or any of its
Affiliates) UAC Shares for the sum of U.S. Dollars paid in excess of Purchase
Price II set forth in Clause 4.2 (i), as set forth in _Appendix 4.5_ hereof.

Appendix 4.5

Appendix 4.6 
Particular Provisions Applicable to PMM and MMMM

  

PMM and MMM state that on 10% of the MMM Shares Subject to Option II and the
PMM Shares Subject to Option II there is an interim measure ordered in the
case entitled " _Harnan Miguel, Marcos y Martina c/Mac Mullen Jorge y otros s/
Medidas cautelares "_, Case N° 76.745 filed at the Civil and Commercial Court
No. 2 of San Nicolas, Buenos Aires Province (the "Interim Measure"), under
which an embargo was placed on 44% of RASA's share capital. The Interim
Measure also placed an embargo on 30% of the dividends accruing from the
liened RASA shares. Likewise, the MMM Shares Subject to Option II and the PMM
Shares Subject to Option II could be affected by a nullity lawsuit in which
the ownership of 80% of RASA's share capital is argued in the proceedings "
_Harnan, Miguel, Marcos y Martina c/ Mac Mullen Jorge Enrique y otros s/ Acci
on de nulidad_", Case No. 76806, filed before the Civil and Commercial Court
No. 5 of San Nicolas, Buenos Aires Province (the "Nullity Lawsuit").

  

Accordingly, in the event of an unfavorable outcome (the procedural principles
set out in the following paragraph apply) of the Interim Measure and/or the
Nullity Lawsuit, PMM and MMM undertake to return to the Buyer and/or its
Affiliates 75% of the UAC Shares received in payment in the event of the
exercise of Call Option II, excluding shares received in excess of such
calculation and which are subject to the irrevocable put option set forth in
clause 4.4. As security for the fulfilment of their obligation, they undertake
to pledge on the Closing Date such UAC Shares in substantially the same manner
as the terms set out in Appendix 5.2 (v) in favor of the Buyer and/or its
Affiliates.

  

The pledge on the UAC Shares will expire once the judicial proceedings listed
above obtain a favorable result that completely rejects the claim of the
plaintiff (in accordance with the modes of termination of the proceedings
regulated in the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure of the Province of
Buenos Aires, including the transaction validated by final judgment) and are
completed and, as long as there is no pending resolution or compliance with
any claim, action or procedure directly or indirectly related to such legal
proceedings, or which in any way could affect the peaceful ownership of and/or
the exercise of the rights derived from the MMM Shares Subject to Option II
and the PMM Shares Subject to Option II. It shall be understood that the
conditions for the cancellation of the pledge have been met when: (i) the
aforementioned conditions are met, (ii) the one-year limitation period for the
autonomous action for review of the _res judicata_ has elapsed (article 2564
Civil and Commercial Code), from the date on which the final judgement or
decision on the merits which terminates the last of the legal proceedings
referred to above becomes final (in accordance with the modes of termination
of the proceedings regulated in the Civil and Commercial Procedural Code of
the Province of Buenos Aires), and (iii) the termination of such proceedings
has been notified in a reliable manner to the Buyer and/or its Affiliates.

     

PMM and MMM undertake to sustain and/or continue with the defense presented to
date in the judicial proceedings mentioned above and not to perform any act
that may affect the acquisition of MMM Shares Subject to Option II and PMM
Shares Subject to Option II by the Buyer and/or its Affiliates.
