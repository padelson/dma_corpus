2.6 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Acquired Assets
(the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall be $104,000,000, subject to adjustment as

2.7 _Payment of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be paid at Closing,
as follows:

(a) Buyer shall deliver to the Company a promissory note (the " _Note_ ") in
the amount of $14,000,000 and in the form of  _Exhibit 2.7_.



 

11 (b) Buyer, on behalf of the Company, shall pay that amount necessary to be
paid to applicable lenders and other creditors of the Company in order to
obtain clear title to the Acquired Assets free and clear of all Liens (such
aggregate payoff amount to be approved by the Company and Buyer) directly to

(c) Buyer shall pay the balance of the Purchase Price (the " _Cash Payment_
") to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon no less
than ten (10) days advance written notice to the Company, Buyer may elect
in its sole discretion to pay up to $10,000,000 of the Cash Payment by

Payment Buyer elects to make in shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
divided by the average of the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock
for each of the ten (10) trading days prior to the Closing Date. Any such
shares issued to the Company (or its designees) shall consist of shares of
Parent Common Stock that have not been registered under the Securities Act.

2.8 _Determination of Net Asset Value_. 

(a) The Purchase Price assumes that, as of the Effective Time, the Net Asset
Value will be $0 (the " _Minimum NAV_ "). 

(b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall submit to Buyer a written statement (derived from the information in
the estimated Detailed Company Balance Sheet) which shall set forth in
reasonable detail an estimate of the NAV (the " _Estimated NAV_ ") as of the
Effective Time, which Estimated NAV shall be calculated in a
manner consistent with the Companys Historical Accounting Policies.
Commencing with the Companys delivery of the Estimated NAV to Buyer, Buyer
shall have full access to the books and records and personnel of the Company
and the opportunity to consult with the Company for purposes of confirming or
disputing the Estimated NAV. If Buyer shall disagree, in good faith, with any
item set forth in the Estimated NAV, then Buyer and the Company shall work, in
good faith, to reach agreement on such disputed items and the amounts as
agreed to by Buyer and the Company shall be deemed the Estimated NAV.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers agreement with the Estimated NAV shall
not foreclose, prevent, limit or preclude any rights or remedy of Buyer set
forth in this Agreement. If the Estimated NAV is less than the Minimum NAV,
then the Purchase Price and the Cash Payment shall be reduced on a dollar-for-
dollar basis by an amount equal to the difference between the Minimum NAV and
the Estimated NAV and (ii) if the Estimated NAV is greater than the Minimum
NAV, then the Purchase Price and the Cash Payment shall be increased on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by an amount equal to the difference between the
Estimated NAV and the Minimum NAV.



 

12 (c) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall submit to the
Company a written statement (derived from the information in the final
Detailed Company Balance Sheet) setting forth in reasonable detail Buyers
calculation of NAV as of the Effective Time, which calculation shall be
performed using accounting policies consistent with the Companys Historical
Accounting Policies. Upon delivery of such written statement of Buyers
calculation of NAV, Buyer and the Company shall work, in good faith, to agree
upon the actual NAV as of the Effective Time. In the event that Buyer and the
Company cannot agree on the amount of any item set forth in Buyers
calculation of NAV within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the amount
of any such disputed items shall be resolved by an Independent Accountant,
and the amount of all other items shall be final, binding and conclusive on
Buyer and the Company. The determination by the Independent Accountant, as set
forth in a notice to be delivered to Buyer and the Company within thirty (30)
days after the submission of the disputed items to the Independent Accountant
(or such later period as may be required by the Independent Accountant), shall
be final, binding and conclusive on Buyer and the Company. The
Independent Accountant shall determine the party ( _i.e._ , Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be) whose asserted position as to the amount of the
disputed item is furthest from the determination of the amount of the disputed
item by the Independent Accountant, which non-prevailing party shall pay the
fees and expenses in connection with this _Section 2.8_.

(d) If the actual NAV, as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_,
is (i) less than the Estimated NAV, then the Company shall pay Buyer an amount
equal to the difference between the Estimated NAV and the actual NAV or (ii)
greater than the Estimated NAV, then Buyer shall pay the Company an amount
equal to the difference between the actual NAV and the Estimated NAV. Any
payment required by this subsection (d) shall be made (i) together with
interest at the rate of 4% per annum, which interest shall begin accruing on
the Closing Date and end on the date that the payment is made, and (ii) within
five (5) days after the date the actual NAV is finally determined, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

2.9 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within sixty (60) days after the final
determination of the Net Asset Value, Buyer shall provide the Seller Parties
a schedule allocating the Purchase Price (and Assumed Liabilities that are
liabilities for income Tax purposes) among the Acquired Assets and the
covenant not to compete set forth in _Section 3.8_ (the " _Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule_ "). The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be
prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and shall be reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and the Seller Parties. Buyer and the Seller Parties
shall make appropriate adjustments to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
to reflect changes in the Purchase Price. Unless otherwise required by a
determination of a Taxing authority that is final, Buyer and the Seller
Parties agree for all Tax reporting purposes to report the Transaction in
accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and to not take any
position during the course of any audit or other proceeding (whether
administrative or judicial) inconsistent with such schedule.

2.10 _Closing_. The parties shall consummate the Transaction at a closing
(the " _Closing_ ") to be held on the first business day of the first
calendar month commencing after the satisfaction of all of the conditions set
forth in Articles VII and VIII hereof, or on such other date as may be
mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto. The date of Closing is referred
to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall: (a) take place at the
offices of Buyers counsel in Chicago, Illinois, and at such time as may be
mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Seller Parties; and (b) be effective as
of 11:59 p.m. Chicago time on the day preceding the Closing Date (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Antitrust Laws will expire or terminate as soon as reasonably possible after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Buyer shall pay all application

insure that any applicable waiting periods imposed under the Antitrust Laws
terminate or expire as early as practicable.

(b) The Company and Buyer shall cause their respective counsel to furnish each

3.6 _Public Announcements; Confidentiality_.

(a) The parties will consult with each other before issuing any press releases

and regulations of any securities exchange.



 

15 (b) In connection with the Transaction, one or more of the parties hereto, or
their Agents (collectively, the " _Receiving Party_ ") may receive
Confidential Information regarding the other party or parties or their
subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Disclosing Party_ "). No Receiving Party
shall: (i) disclose or reveal any Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party to any Person other than those of their Agents who clearly need such
information to actively and directly participate in the evaluation of the
Transaction (and such Agents will be directed to maintain the information

comply with the foregoing restrictions, and will be responsible for any
breach of the terms of this Agreement by its Agents.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 3.6_ shall survive, and remain in effect
after, any termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
following consummation of the Closing, the provisions of _Section 3.6(b)_
shall no longer apply to Buyer.

3.7 _Third Party Consents_. To the extent that the Companys rights under any
Contract, License or other asset to be assigned to Buyer under this Agreement
may not be assigned without the consent of another Person which has not been
obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same
if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or be
unlawful, and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain any such
required consent(s) as promptly as reasonably possible; provided, however,
that any such Contract listed on _Schedule 2.2(f)_ shall constitute an Assumed
Contract regardless of whether or not such consent has been obtained unless
such Contract is set forth on _Schedule 3.7_. If any such consent shall not be
obtained prior to the Closing Date, the Company, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, shall act after the Closing as Buyers agent in order to
obtain for it the benefits thereunder and shall cooperate, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law, with Buyer in any other reasonable arrangement

agreement to exclude from the Acquired Assets any assets described under
_Section 2.2_.

which event, only after a period of two years after such resignation or
termination, but in no event prior to the date that is three years after the
Closing Date);

(iii) solicit, contact or deal with: (1) any Person that is, or during the
five-year period preceding the Closing Date was, a customer of the Company or
such customers successors or assigns, in each case for the purpose of
providing services or products which are competitive with the Business, or (2)

two-year period preceding the Closing Date, or any such Persons successors or
assigns, in each case for the purpose of offering or providing services or
products which are competitive with the Business;

(iv) cause or seek to cause to be terminated or adversely affected, or
otherwise interfere with, any agreement or arrangement of any kind known by
such Seller Party, including any Assumed Contract, to which Buyer or any of

or

(v) seek to interfere with or adversely affect the ongoing relationships
between Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, on the one hand, and
their respective suppliers and customers, on the other hand.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions in  _Section 3.8(a)_
shall not prohibit any Seller Partys ownership, acquisition, sale or lease of
the Real Property, any other property leased or subleased to Buyer in
connection with this Transaction, and any other retail gasoline outlet, car
wash and convenience store properties; _provided_ , that: (i) such properties
or the operating rights for the businesses conducted thereon are held solely
for investment purposes and no Seller Party is directly involved in the day-
to-day operation of such businesses; (ii) such properties (other than the
Owned Real Property and any other property leased or subleased to Buyer in
connection with this Transaction) are not located within a two (2) mile radius
of any retail gasoline outlet, car wash or convenience store owned or
operated by Buyer or any of its affiliates (it being agreed that such
determination shall only be made on the acquisition date of such property by
the applicable Seller Party), other than (A) in the case of any car wash
location that does not include a retail gasoline outlet or convenience store,
such location is not within a two (2) mile radius of any property owned or
operated by Buyer or its affiliates that includes a car wash (whether stand-
alone or in combination with a retail gasoline outlet and / or  



 

17  convenience store) and (b) with respect to the Companys potential
acquisition of a car wash located at 5500 S. Lincoln (Route 53) in
Lisle, Illinois, provided that the Company provides Buyer with a right of
first offer to lease the property and operate it as a car wash; and (iii) the
Seller Parties shall provide Buyer with a right of first refusal with respect

governed by the provisions of subsection (ii), (Y) transfers to affiliates or
family members ( _provided_ , that any such affiliate or family member agrees
to be bound by the right of first refusal described above with respect to any
subsequent acquisition, sale or lease) and (Z) the Companys Wheaton,
Illinois retail gasoline outlet.

(c) Each Seller Party recognizes the importance of the covenants contained in
this _Section 3.8_ and acknowledges that, based on its or his past
experience, and the projected expansion of Buyers business throughout the
Territory, the restrictions imposed herein are: (i) reasonable as to scope,
time and area; (ii) necessary for the protection of Buyers legitimate
business interests, including the trade secrets, goodwill and relationships
with customers and suppliers purchased by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;
and (iii) not unduly restrictive of any rights of any Seller Party. Each
Seller Party acknowledges and agrees that the covenants contained in this
_Section 3.8_ are essential elements of this Agreement and that but for these
covenants Buyer would not have agreed to purchase the Acquired Assets. The
existence of any claim or cause of action against Buyer by any Seller Party,
whether predicated on Buyers breach of this Agreement or otherwise, shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by Buyer of the covenants contained
in this _Section 3.8_.

(d) Each Seller Party acknowledges that the success of Buyers business after
the Closing Date depends upon the continued preservation of the
confidentiality of certain information possessed by the Seller Parties, that
the preservation of the confidentiality of such information by the
Seller Parties is an essential premise of the bargain between the Seller
Parties and Buyer, and that Buyer would be unwilling to enter into this
Agreement in the absence of this _Section 3.8_. Accordingly, each Seller
Party hereby agrees with Buyer that such Seller Party and its Agents will
not, at any time on or after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, without
the prior consent of Buyer, disclose any Confidential Information regarding
the Acquired Assets or the Business, or use such Confidential Information for
any purpose other than the performance of any Seller Partys duties as an
employee of Buyer. Each Seller Party agrees that it will be responsible for
any breach or violation of the provisions of this  _Section 3.8_ by any of
its Agents.

(e) If any Seller Party commits a breach or threatens to commit a breach of
any of the provisions of this _Section 3.8_, Buyer shall have the right and
remedy, in addition to any others that may be available, at law or in equity,
to: (i) have the provisions of this _Section 3.8_ specifically enforced by
any court having equity jurisdiction, through injunctive or other relief, it
being acknowledged that any such breach or threatened breach will cause
irreparable injury to Buyer, the amount of which will be difficult to
determine, and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to
Buyer; and (ii) collect all costs of enforcement of this Agreement, including
reasonable attorneys fees and costs, from the Seller Party who breaches such
covenants.



 

18 (f) If any covenant contained in this _Section 3.8_, or any part thereof, is
hereafter construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall not affect
the remainder of the covenants, which shall be given full effect, without
regard to the invalid portions, and any court having jurisdiction shall have
the power to reduce the duration, scope and/or area of such covenant and, in
its reduced form, said covenant shall then be enforceable.

3.9 _Due Diligence; Exclusivity_. From and after the date hereof and until
the earlier of (i) the Closing, or (ii) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article X:

(a) Buyer and its representatives may make such examinations and inspections
of the Company and its facilities, books, records and systems as Buyer
may reasonably require to analyze their financial condition, properties,
legal matters, business and affairs, so long as such examinations occur during
normal business hours and do not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the Business. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall: (a) provide access to such employees of the Company as Buyer may
reasonably request, and (b) cause the Companys officers, directors, employees
and accountants (collectively, " _Agents_ ") to cooperate with Buyer in its
investigations and to make their files and work papers available to Buyer.

(b) Neither any Seller Party nor any of its Agents shall, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage submission of, or accept or
agree to, any proposal or offer from any Person relating to any acquisition of
the capital stock of the Company, any material portion of the assets of the
Company, any merger or consolidation with or involving the Company, or any
other similar transaction or business combination involving the Company or its
business (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "); or (ii) participate in any
negotiations or discussions regarding, or furnish to any other Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist
or participate in, or facilitate any effort or attempt by any other Person to
effect or seek an Acquisition Proposal.

3.10 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Buyer and the Company shall provide each other with such assistance as may
reasonably be requested by the other in connection with the preparation
of any Tax return or any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes. Buyer
and the Company shall retain for the full period of any statute of
limitations, and provide the other access to, any records or information which
may be relevant to Taxes of the Company for the period prior to the Closing.

(b) Buyer and the Company shall each be responsible for one-half of any and
all transfer, sales, use, purchase, value added, excise, real property, stamp
or similar taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed on or resulting from the
transfer of any Acquired Assets pursuant to this Agreement (including any
Transfer Taxes imposed on Buyer) and any other out-of-pocket costs and
expenses that directly result from the transfer of the Acquired Assets to
Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Company shall file all
necessary Tax returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes,
fees and charges, and, if required by applicable Law, Buyer will join in the
execution of any such Tax returns and other documentation.



 

19 (c) If a period for Taxes related to the Acquired Assets or Designated
Employees begins before and ends after the Closing Date, the parties agree
that the Taxes attributable to the period ending on or before the Closing Date
shall constitute Taxes of the Company and be appropriately classified as
Excluded Liabilities, and the parties agree to use the following conventions
to determine the amount of Taxes that are attributable to the period ending on
or before the Closing Date:

(i) in the case of income Taxes, capital Taxes, Taxes imposed on the transfer
of property or Taxes imposed on payments to third parties (including wages),
the amount attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date shall equal the amount of such Taxes that would be paid for such period
if the period closed at the end of the Closing Date and the parties used a
"closing of the books methodology"; and

(ii) in the case of all other Taxes (including property Taxes), the amount
attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall
equal the amount of Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the period ending
on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in
the entire period.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any lease in
respect of the Real Property leased to Buyer by any Seller Party or any third
party in connection with the Transaction, Buyer shall be responsible for the
timely payment of all property Taxes for periods prior to the Closing in
respect of the Real Property leased to Buyer in connection with the
Transaction to the extent such property Taxes were included in the calculation
of Net Asset Value. Buyer and the Seller Parties hereby agree to reconcile the
amount of property Taxes included in the calculation of Net Asset Value with
the actual amount of such property Taxes promptly after the actual amount of
such property Taxes is known (and any deficient or excess amount shall
promptly be paid by the applicable party to the other party).

3.11 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by the Company with
the provisions of any so-called "bulk transfer law" of any jurisdiction in
connection with the sale of the Acquired Assets to Buyer. Sellers agree to
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all Indemnified
Losses that may be asserted by third parties against Buyer as a result
of noncompliance with any such bulk transfer law.

3.12 _Change of Corporate Name_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that all
of its rights in and to, and ownership of, the names "Texor," "Texor
Petroleum," "MinuteMan" and any names substantially similar thereto shall be
transferred hereunder to Buyer. From and after the Closing, the Company shall
be prohibited from using such names, except as necessary to effect the change
of the corporate name of the Company or to evidence that such change has
occurred. Promptly following the Closing, the Company shall have filed all
documents with the appropriate governmental authorities in the State of
Illinois, and such other states as the Company is so qualified and registered,
to change the name of the Company to a name which does not contain the word
"Texor," "Texor Petroleum" or any other substantially similar word.



 

20 3.13 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Buyer shall offer employment to all the employees of the Company listed on
_Exhibit 3.12(a)_, which offer of employment shall be on substantially the
same terms provided by the Company to such employees immediately prior to the
date hereof (the " _Designated Employees_ "). All Designated Employees to whom
Buyer makes an offer of employment and who accept employment with Buyer will
become employees of Buyer (the " _Hired Employees_ ") effective as of the
Closing Date (the " _Hire Date_ "). The Company agrees that it will assist
Buyer in communicating such offers of employment to the Designated Employees
and arranging for Buyer to meet with such employees regarding the offers. The
Company shall remain responsible for all obligations and liabilities with
respect to Designated Employees who decline Buyers offer of employment and
employees of the Company not listed on _Exhibit 3.12(a)_.

(b) Each Hired Employee shall be given credit for his or her period
of service with the Company under each of Buyers employee benefit plans,
programs, policies, arrangements and agreements for purposes of all
participation and vesting service requirements. Each such Hired Employee
shall, with respect to any of Buyers plans or programs which have co-
payment, deductible or other co-insurance features, receive credit for any
amounts such individual has paid to date in the plan year as of the Closing
Date under comparable plans or programs maintained by the Company prior to
the Closing Date. Each Hired Employee and eligible dependent who, at the
Closing Date, was participating in an employee group health plan maintained by
the Company shall not be excluded from Buyers employee group health plan or
limited in coverage thereunder by reason of any waiting period restriction or
pre-existing condition limitation.

(c) The Company shall retain responsibility for all of the Employee Plans.
The Company shall retain responsibility for all liability for any health care
continuation coverage or notice requirement under Section 4980B of the Code
and Part G of Subtitle B of Title 1 of ERISA arising on or before the Closing
Date with respect to any Employee Plan, and Buyer shall be responsible for any
such health care continuation coverage or notice requirements arising with
respect to any Hired Employee after the Closing Date.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 3.13_ are a covenant between Buyer and
the Company and shall not, in any manner, create any contractual right of
employment for any employee of the Company.

3.14 _Receivables_. In the event a Receivable for which the Seller Parties
have made an indemnification payment to Buyer pursuant to Section 9.1(c) is
subsequently collected by Buyer within three years after the Closing Date,
then Buyer shall promptly pay the Company the amount of such Receivable, less
any third party collection related expenses (including attorneys fees). Buyer
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the Companys
past practices to collect such Receivables, which may include litigation. For
purposes of applying collections by Buyer, all collections received from a
customer which are not specifically identified for application to specific
invoices or accounts shall be applied first to the oldest components of
specific Receivables of such customer.



 

21 3.15 _Notice of Developments_. The Seller Parties, on the one hand, and Buyer
and Parent, on the other hand, shall give prompt written notice to each other
of any development causing a breach of any of their respective representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement, and of any failure to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by such party hereunder. No disclosure by any party pursuant to this
_Section 3.16_, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the schedule
referred to in such representation or warranty or to prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant.

3.16 _Guaranty of Buyer Obligations_. Parent hereby unconditionally
guarantees to each Seller Party the full and timely payment and performance by
Buyer of all of the obligations, liabilities and agreements of Buyer under the
Note and this Agreement, including, without limitation, Buyers payment
obligations under the Note, _Sections 2.7_ and _2.8_ of this Agreement and
Article IX of this Agreement. The foregoing guarantee shall include the
guarantee of the payment of all Indemnified Losses which might
become recoverable as a result of the nonperformance of any of the
obligations, liabilities or agreements so guaranteed or as a result of the
nonperformance of this guarantee. The Seller Parties may, at their option,
proceed directly against Parent for the payment and performance of any
obligation, liability or agreement of Buyer guaranteed by Parent hereunder,
without first proceeding against Buyer or against any of its properties.
Parent further agrees that its guarantee shall be an irrevocable guarantee
and shall continue in effect notwithstanding any extension or modification of
any guaranteed obligation, liability or agreement, any assumption of any such
guaranteed obligation, liability or agreement by any other party or any other
act or thing which might otherwise operate as a legal or equitable discharge
of a guarantor, and Parent hereby waives all special suretyship defenses and
notice requirements.

3.17 _Non-Disturbance Agreements for Leases_. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to procure and deliver to Buyer an executed
non-disturbance agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, from
each lender of any landlord with a security interest in the Leased Real
Property. In the event the Company is unable to procure any such non-
disturbance agreement prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall continue to
use commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing Date to procure such
non-disturbance agreement.

3.18 _Automobile Allowance_. Buyer agrees to provide each Hired Employee that
is not a party to a written employment agreement with Buyer an automobile
allowance equal to the amount shown opposite such individuals name on
_Schedule 3.18_ (plus $100 per month) until the expiration of the current
remaining term of the related lease agreement.

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty of any
Seller Party contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate, schedule,
instrument or document delivered to Buyer by or on behalf of a Seller Party
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , that for purposes
of this _Section 9.1(a)_, no force or effect shall be given to any
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers;

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of any Seller Party contained in this Agreement, or in any
instrument or document delivered to Buyer by or on behalf of any Seller
Party pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement;



 

40 (c) any Receivables included in the calculation of the Net Asset Value which
are outstanding as of the Closing Date and which are not paid in full within
120 days after the Closing Date;

(d) any Supplier Termination Amounts as of the Closing (specifically
excluding any such amounts resulting from upfront payments and reimbursements
and rebates received by Buyer after the Closing Date) to the extent (i) Buyer
does not have recourse for payment against a dealer/operator, and (ii) such
Supplier Termination Amounts do not relate to retail locations leased to, and
operated by, Buyer in connection with the Transaction;

(e) any Proceeding initiated by a shareholder or former shareholder of the
Company;

(f) any Environmental Condition; and 

(g) any Excluded Liability.

9.2 _Indemnification by Buyer and Parent_. Buyer and Parent (on a joint and
several basis) shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Parties
and their respective partners, officers, directors, employees, estates,
executors, trusts, trustees, heirs, beneficiaries and agents, and each of
them (hereinafter collectively called " _Seller Party Indemnitees_ ") against
and in respect of any and all Indemnified Losses incurred by any Seller
Indemnitee by reason of, or arising out of:

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty of Buyer contained in this
Agreement, or in any certificate, schedule, instrument or document delivered
to the Seller Parties by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement;

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of Buyer contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate,
schedule, instrument or document delivered to the Seller Parties by or on
behalf of Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement;

(c) the ownership or operation of the Acquired Assets after the Effective Time
(other than in respect of the Excluded Liabilities), except to the extent any
Indemnified Losses relate to a matter for which the Buyer Indemnitees are
indemnified pursuant to _Section 9.1_; and

(d) any Assumed Liability.

9.3  _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) For the purposes of this _Section 9.3_, the term " _Indemnitee_ " shall
refer to the Person indemnified, or entitled, or claiming to be entitled, to
be indemnified, pursuant to the provisions of _Section 9.1_ or _9.2_ , as the
case may be; and the term " _Indemnitor_ " shall refer to each Person having
the obligation to indemnify pursuant to such provisions.

(b) An Indemnitee shall give written notice (a " _Notice of Claim_ ") to the
Indemnitor within fifteen (15) days (or, to the extent reasonably possible,
within such shorter  



 

41  period as may be necessary to give the Indemnitor a reasonable opportunity
to respond to such claim) after the Indemnitee has knowledge of any
claim (including a Third-Party Claim in which case such Notice of Claim shall
set forth the name of the party making such Third-Party Claim, to the extent
known), which an Indemnitee has determined has given or could give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement. No failure to give such Notice
of Claim shall affect the indemnification obligations of the Indemnitor
hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced such
Indemnitors ability to successfully defend the matter giving rise to the
claim. The Notice of Claim shall provide a reasonable description of the
claim, action or circumstances giving rise to such Indemnified Losses, and the
Indemnitor shall have a period of thirty (30) days to reply to such Notice of
Claim. Other than with respect to Third-Party Claims which shall be governed
by the additional terms and conditions of clause (c) of this _Section 9.3_,
if the Indemnitor disputes any such claim (any such disputed claim, a "
_Disputed Indemnification Claim_ ") or fails to respond to such Notice of
Claim within the allotted thirty (30) day reply period, the Indemnitee shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available under this Agreement;
provided, that in the case of a Disputed Indemnification Claim, Buyers set-
off rights shall be restricted as provided in _Section 9.4_.

(c) In addition to the terms set forth in clause (b) of this _Section 9.3_,
any claim or action by a third party arising after the Closing Date (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ ") shall be governed by the additional terms and
conditions in this clause (c). The Indemnitor shall be given the opportunity
to assume and control the defense of any such Third-Party Claim so long
as (i) the Indemnitor agrees to indemnify the Indemnitee against all
Indemnified Losses arising out of or caused by the Third-Party Claim, (ii) the
Indemnitor provides the Indemnitee with reasonable evidence that the
Indemnitor will have the financial resources to defend against the Third-
Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (iii) the
Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction
or other equitable relief, and (iv) the Indemnitor diligently conducts the
defense of the Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnitor wishes to assume the
defense of any such Third-Party Claim, on the terms set forth herein, the
Indemnitor shall give written notice to the Indemnitee within fifteen (15)
days after its receipt of the Notice of Claim in respect of such Third-Party
Claim, and the Indemnitor shall thereafter assume and control the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, through counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee, _provided_ , that the Indemnitee may participate in (but not
control) such defense at its own expense. Whether or not the Indemnitor elects
to assume and control the defense of any such Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnitor shall not be relieved of the Indemnitors obligations
hereunder. Except for the settlement of a Third Party Claim which involves the
payment of money only which is to be paid in full by the Indemnitor, the
Indemnitor shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the
Indemnitor shall not assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnitee may defend against any such claim or action in such manner as it
may deem appropriate and, upon no less than fifteen (15) days advance written
notice to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee may settle such claim on such terms
as it may deem appropriate but subject to the Indemnitors approval, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such settlement shall be deemed approved by the Indemnitor if the Indemnitor
fails to object thereto, by written notice to the Indemnitee, within fifteen
(15) days after the Indemnitors receipt of a written summary of such
settlement. To the extent constituting Indemnified Losses, the Indemnitor
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee for the amount of all reasonable
expenses, legal and otherwise, incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with
the defense and settlement of such Third-Party Claim.



 

42 9.4 _Buyer s Set-Off Rights_. Without limiting any other rights of Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, Buyer may, upon no less than fifteen
(15) days advance written notice to each Seller Party (but in no event prior
to the expiration of the thirty (30) day reply period set forth in _Section
9.3(b)_ hereof), set-off against the Note (without duplication of any set-off
previously implemented by Buyer with respect to any Indemnified Losses): (i)
any and all Indemnified Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee and subject to
indemnification under _Section 9.1_; and (ii) any reduction of the Purchase
Price determined pursuant to _Section 2.8_, but only to the extent such
reduction is not promptly paid by a Seller Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event a Seller Party challenges, within fifteen (15) days
of receipt of written notice of set-off from Buyer (or, if later, by the
expiration of the thirty (30) day reply period set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_
hereof), Buyers right to set-off with respect to a particular claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1 _that is in excess of $150,000,
Buyer shall be required to make payment of any such disputed amount, to the
extent a payment would otherwise be then due and payable under the Note, to a
third party escrow agent mutually acceptable to the parties hereto to be held
pursuant to the terms and conditions of a mutually acceptable escrow agreement
until resolution of such disputed amount, which escrow agreement shall
provide for the payment of interest on the escrowed amount to the prevailing
party. The fees and expenses of the escrow agent shall be paid by the non-
prevailing party.

9.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. All indemnification payments made under this
Agreement shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price. 

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing Date, none of the parties
hereto shall be liable or responsible in any manner whatsoever to any other
party, whether for indemnification or otherwise, except for indemnity as
expressly provided in this Article IX, which provides the exclusive remedy and
cause of action of the parties hereto (other than with respect to fraud or
willful breach) with respect to any matter arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement or any Schedule or Exhibit hereto or any opinion or
certificate delivered in connection herewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement shall limit the remedy available to a party for
claims arising out of breaches of _Section 3.6_ (Confidentiality) and
_Section 3.8_ (Covenant Against Competition).

9.7 _Time Limitations on Seller Party Indemnification_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(a) After Closing, the Seller Parties shall not be responsible under _Section
9.1(a)_ for any Indemnified Loss unless a Buyer Indemnitee shall have
provided the Company with a Notice of Claim with respect to such Indemnified
Loss prior to the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Indemnity Notice Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that: 

(i) with respect to any Indemnified Loss resulting or arising from any breach
of any representation of Seller Parties in  _Section 4.9_ or _4.18_ , the
Indemnity Notice Period shall extend until sixty (60) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; and



 

43 (ii) with respect to any Indemnified Loss resulting or arising from any breach
of any representation of Seller Parties in _Section 4.20_, the Indemnity
Notice Period shall extend until five (5) years after the Closing Date.

(b) There shall be no Indemnity Notice Period for the following claims against
Seller Parties (and such claims shall survive for the maximum term permitted
by Law):

(i) claims for Indemnified Losses resulting or arising from the breach of any
covenant of Seller Parties contained in  _Section 3.2_, _3.4_ , _3.6_ ,
_3.7_ , _3.8_ , _3.10_ , _3.11_ or _3.12_ ;

(ii) claims for Indemnified Losses resulting or arising from the breach of
any representation of Seller Parties contained in _Section 4.2_, _4.3_ ,
_4.7(a)_ or _4.24_ ;

(iii) claims for Indemnified Losses resulting or arising from any Excluded
Liability; and

(iv) claims based on fraud or intentional breach or misrepresentation.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller
Parties shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees to the
extent any act, negligence or willful misconduct of a third party (other than
the Seller Parties or their contractors, employees, agents, licensees,
invitees, successors or assigns) that occurs more than three years after the
Closing Date causes any Release of any Regulated Substance from any
underground storage tank system at any Real Property.

9.8 _No Consequential Damages_. Except in the event of fraud or intentional
breach or misrepresentation, Seller Parties shall not be liable for special,
incidental, consequential or punitive damages.

9.9 _Order of Remedies_. In pursuing the collection of any Indemnified Losses,
Buyer Indemnitees shall proceed first pursuant to the set-off right set forth
in the Note prior to pursuing any other right or remedy available to Buyer
Indemnitees hereunder or otherwise.

9.10 _Liability Cap and Basket_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

(a) Seller Parties shall have no obligation to indemnify or reimburse Buyer
Indemnitees with respect to Indemnified Losses resulting or arising under
_Section 9.1(a)_ (other than (i) Indemnified Losses resulting or arising in
the event of fraud or intentional breach or misrepresentation, (ii) pursuant
to _Section 4.20_ or (iii) the Excluded Representations) until the aggregate
amount of all Indemnified Losses under _Section 9.1(a)_ exceeds $520,000, in
which event Seller Parties shall reimburse Buyer Indemnitees for all
Indemnified Losses in excess of $520,000;



 

44 (b) The aggregate indemnification obligation of Seller Parties to Buyer
Indemnitees with respect to Indemnified Losses arising under _Section
9.1(a)_ (other than Indemnified Losses resulting or arising in the event of
fraud or intentional breach or misrepresentation or pursuant to the Excluded
Representations) shall not exceed $20,800,000; (the " _Cap_ ");

(c) The aggregate liability of each of Gleitsman and Speiser to indemnify
Buyer Indemnitees from and against any Indemnified Losses shall be limited to
such Seller Partys Pro Rata Portion of such Indemnified Losses (i.e.
Gleitsman and Speiser shall each be liable for only 50% of any specific
Indemnified Losses);

(d) The aggregate liability of each of Gleitsman and Speiser to indemnify
Buyer Indemnitees from and against any Indemnified Losses shall (in addition
to the other limitations provided herein) be limited to such Seller Partys
Pro Rata Portion of the sum of the Cash Payment (reduced by any portion of the
Cash Payment attributable to any payment in respect of NAV under _Section
2.8_) and such Seller Partys Pro Rata Portion of any amounts actually paid
to the Company pursuant to the Note;

(e) In no event shall the aggregate liability of Gleitsman, Speiser and the
Company, collectively, to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees from and against any
Indemnified Losses exceed the sum of the Cash Payment (reduced by any portion
of the Cash Payment attributable to any payment in respect of NAV under
_Section 2.8_) and any amounts actually paid to the Company pursuant to the
Note;

(f) With respect to Indemnified Losses resulting or arising from a
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or breach or nonfulfillment of any
covenant relating exclusively to Gleitsman or Speiser, such breaching Seller
Party and the Company shall jointly and severally indemnify Buyer
Indemnitees; and

(g) The representations and warranties of the Seller Parties shall not be
affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf
of Buyer (including by any of Buyers Agents) or by reason of the fact that
Buyer or any of Buyers Agents knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is or might be inaccurate.

9.11 _General Indemnification Provisions_. The rights and remedies of any
party based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or failure to
fulfill any condition shall in no way be limited by the fact that the act,
omission, occurrence or other state of facts upon which any claim of any such
inaccuracy or breach is based may also be the subject matter of any other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement as to which there is no
inaccuracy or breach.

any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The electronic
transmission of a signed signature page, by one party to the other(s), shall
constitute valid execution and acceptance of this Agreement by the
signing/transmitting party. This Agreement supersedes all prior discussions
and agreements between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and this Agreement contains the sole and entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the matters covered hereby, except for the confidentiality
agreement dated on or about September 18, 2007 between the Company and Parent,
which confidentiality agreement remains in full force and effect.
All Exhibits and Schedules hereto shall be deemed a part of this Agreement.
This Agreement shall not be altered or amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by or on behalf of all of the parties hereto. No ambiguity in
any provision hereof shall be construed against a party by reason of the fact
it was drafted by such party or its counsel. References to "include,"
"includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." For purposes of this Agreement: "hereof," "hereby,"
"hereunder," "herewith," "hereafter" and "hereinafter" refer to this Agreement
in its entirety, and not to any particular subsection or paragraph.

11.3 _Governing Law_. The validity and effect of this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of Illinois. Any dispute, controversy or question of interpretation
arising under, out of, in connection with or in relation to this Agreement or
any amendments hereof, or any breach or default hereunder, shall be litigated
in the state or federal courts in Cook County, Illinois. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court sitting in
Cook County, Illinois. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any such action in Cook County, Illinois. It is understood and
agreed that the provisions of this Agreement relating to jurisdiction and
venue are part of the value consideration given and relied upon by the parties
in connection with the purchase contemplated hereby.

11.4 _Successors and Assigns; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
heirs, executors, legal representatives, permitted assigns and
successors. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the covenants
in _Section 3.8_ will inure to the benefit of, and may be enforced by, the
successors and assigns of Buyer (including any person purchasing Buyer or the
Acquired Assets). No party hereto may assign any of its rights under this
Agreement without the prior consent of the other parties, except that Buyer
may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to any wholly-owned
subsidiary of Buyer. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will
be construed to give any person other than the parties to this Agreement any
legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its
provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and their successors and permitted assigns.

11.5 _Partial Invalidity and Severability_. All rights and restrictions
contained herein may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to
the extent that they do not violate any applicable Law and are intended to be
limited to the extent necessary to render this Agreement legal, valid and
enforceable. If any term of this Agreement not essential to the commercial
purpose of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable by a  



 

48  court or arbitration panel of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of
the parties that the remaining terms hereof shall constitute their
agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and all such remaining
terms shall remain in full force and effect. To the extent legally
permissible, any illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement
shall be replaced by a valid provision which will implement the commercial
purpose of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision.

11.6 _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the party which is entitled to the benefit thereof, but only if such
waiver is evidenced by a writing signed by such party. No failure on the part
of a party hereto to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power
or remedy created hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy by any such party
preclude any other future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. No waiver by any party hereto to any breach of or
default in any term or condition of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver
of or assent to any succeeding breach of or default in the same or any other
term or condition hereof.

11.7 _Headings_. The headings as to contents of particular paragraphs of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be construed as a
part of this Agreement or as a limitation on the scope of any terms or
provisions of this Agreement.

11.8 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all legal and
other costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transaction shall be paid by Buyer or the Seller Parties as each party incurs
such expenses.

shall include the plural, the use of the plural shall include the singular,
and the use of any gender shall include any and all genders.

11.10 _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise
is breached, so that a party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement,
in addition to any other remedy to which such party may be entitled, at law or
in equity. In particular, the parties acknowledge that the Business is unique
and recognize and affirm that in the event that any Seller breaches this
Agreement, money damages would be inadequate and Buyer would have no adequate
remedy at law, so that Buyer shall have the right, in addition to any other
rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce its rights and the other
parties obligations hereunder not only by action for damages but also by
action for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief. 

11.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT ANY OF THEM MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY DOCUMENT CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN
CONJUNCTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING,
STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY. THIS PROVISION
IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTIES ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
