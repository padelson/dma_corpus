deemed to represent one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) Cancellation of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares. (i) Any shares
of Community Common Stock held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent or by Community or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Community, other than those held in a fiduciary capacity
or as a result of debts previously contracted ("Excluded Shares") and (ii)
subject to Section 3.01(d), any Dissenting Shares shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time of the
Merger and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

(d) Dissenting Shares.

 

(i) No later than ten (10) days following the date that Community

granted by Chapter 13 of the CGCL. If a holder of shares of Community Common
Stock who demands that Community purchase such shares under Chapter 13 of the
CGCL shall thereafter effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect
or otherwise) such holders dissenters rights with respect to such shares of
Community Common Stock then, as of the occurrence of such withdrawal or loss,

Time to have been converted into and represent only the right to receive, in
accordance with this Section 3.01, the Merger Consideration for such shares
set forth in this Article 3.

(iii) Community shall comply in all respects with the provisions of
Chapter 13 of the CGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares. Community shall
give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for purchase of any such shares
of Community Common Stock pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL and received by Community in connection
therewith and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to purchase of any shares of Community Common Stock under
Chapter 13 of the CGCL; provided that Parent shall act in a commercially
reasonable manner in directing any such negotiations or proceedings. Community
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as required by
Law, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for purchase of
Community Common Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

3.02 Exchange Procedures.

 

(a) Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent

23 (b) Community Notice. Community shall notify Parent in writing prior to
the Effective Time of the number of Shares, Excluded Shares and, to the extent
practicable, Dissenting Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and shall cause Communitys transfer agent to deliver to the Exchange

Common Stock and number of shares of Community Common Stock held by each such
holder in a format that is reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent and
otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Exchange Agent.

(c) Exchange Procedures.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares) notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the
Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof,
as provided in Section 3.02(g)) and instructions for surrendering
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange
Agent (such materials and instructions to include customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares
and to be in such form and have such provisions as Parent and Community may
reasonably agree).

(ii) Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 3.02(g)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials, the holder
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor:

as applicable) representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 3.02;
and

 

(B) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 3.02(h)) equal to (1) the Cash
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section

(iii) The Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of Community, a certificate representing
the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for
any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate, may be issued
and/or paid to such a transferee if the Exchange Agent is presented with the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares and/or all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 



24 (v) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of Community of the shares of Community Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other
than to settle transfers of such Community Common Stock that occurred prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares representing any such shares of Community Common Stock are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article 3.

 

(d) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting. All shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in
respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.02(g)) or Book-
Entry Shares are surrendered for exchange in accordance with Section 3.02(c).
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
3.02(g)) or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder
of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to surrender.

(e) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any
holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
but for this Section 3.02(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in
lieu thereof (rounded to the nearest cent), which payment shall be determined
by multiplying (i) the Parent Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of
the share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.01(a).

 

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Community as of the nine (9) month
anniversary of the Effective Time will be transferred to Parent. In such
event, any former shareholders of Community who have not theretofore complied
with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares, and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each share of Community Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any 

 



25  former holder of shares of Community Common Stock for any amount delivered
in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

 

(g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common
Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would
be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 

(h) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it
determines is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be
remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the applicable
Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation
determine it must deduct and withhold with respect to the payment of Parent
Common Stock hereunder, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall be entitled to satisfy such withholding first out of any Cash
Consideration otherwise payable to the Person with respect to which such
withholding is being made.

 

(i) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
issued and outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Shares or the issued and outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for shares of Parent Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, redenomination, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio and the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall,
from and after the date of such event, be the Exchange Ratio and the Merger
Consideration, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement.

 

3.03 Treatment of Equity Awards.

 

(a) Community RSUs. At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions
applicable to each outstanding restricted stock unit (a "Community RSU")
under the Communitys 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Community
Stock Plan") shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, accelerate in full and such Community RSU shall be
converted into, and become exchanged for, the Merger Consideration (less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting, which 

 



26  Tax withholding may, at the election of the holder, be effected by deduction
first from the Cash Consideration and, if insufficient, then from the Stock
Consideration equal to such number of shares of Parent Common Stock having a
fair market value, based on the closing price of shares of Parent Common Stock
quoted on NASDAQ for the Closing Date, equal to the amount of Taxes to be
withheld), pursuant to Section 3.01(a).

 

(b) Community Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Community
Board shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to
effectuate the treatment of the Community RSUs pursuant to Section 3.03(a).
Community shall take all actions that are necessary to ensure that from and
after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to deliver shares of Community Common Stock or other capital stock of
Community to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Community RSUs.

or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,

Effect. The deposit accounts of Community are insured by the FDIC through the
Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid
when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are

makes such licensing or qualification necessary. There are no restrictions on
the ability of any Subsidiary of Community to pay dividends or distributions
to Community, except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity,
for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all
such regulated entities. True, complete and correct copies of the articles of
incorporation, bylaws and similar governing documents of each Subsidiary of

material respect with the applicable provisions of the CRA and the regulations
promulgated thereunder. Except as Previously Disclosed, Community has not
received a CRA rating of less than "satisfactory" in any of its three (3)

under the CRA should constitute grounds for either the denial by any
Governmental Authority of any application to consummate the transactions

existence of any fact or circumstance or set of facts or circumstances which
would reasonably be expected to result in Community having its current rating

4.11 Employee Benefit Plans

 

(a) Section 4.11 of the Community Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of each employee benefit plan, program, policy,
practice, Contract, or other arrangement providing benefits to any current or
former employee, officer or director of Community or any of its Subsidiaries
or any beneficiary or dependent thereof that is sponsored or maintained by
Community or any of its Subsidiaries or to which Community or any of its
Subsidiaries contributes or is obligated to contribute, whether or not
written, including, without limitation, any employee welfare benefit plan
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, any employee pension benefit
plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such plan is
subject to ERISA) and any equity purchase plan, option, equity bonus,
phantom 

 



37  equity or other equity plan, profit sharing, bonus, retirement (including
compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits), employment
agreement, deferred compensation, excess benefit, incentive compensation,
severance, change in control or termination pay, hospitalization or other
medical or dental, life or other insurance (including any self-insured

other leave of absence benefits, short- or long-term disability, or vacation
benefits plan or any other agreement or policy or other arrangement providing
employee benefits, employment-related compensation, fringe benefits or other
benefits (whether qualified or nonqualified, funded or unfunded) (each an
"Employee Benefit Plan").

 

(b) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, Community has delivered or
made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each
writing constituting a part of such Employee Benefit Plan, including, without
limitation, all plan documents, benefit schedules, formal or informal trust
agreements, and insurance Contracts and other funding vehicles; (ii) the most
recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule, if any;
(iii) all investment policy statements or guidelines, delegations and charters
related to any Employee Benefit Plan; (iv) each trust agreement, group
annuity Contract or other funding mechanism relating to any Employee Benefit
Plan, (v) the current summary plan description and any material modifications
thereto, if any; (vi) the most recent annual financial report, if any; (vii)
the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (viii) the most recent
determination letter from the IRS, if any. Except as specifically provided in
the foregoing documents delivered or made available to Parent, there are no
amendments to any Employee Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved
nor has Community or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such
amendments or to adopt or approve any new Employee Benefit Plan. No Employee
Benefit Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States, or
covers any employee residing or working outside of the United States.

 

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of
the Code and each related trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination or may rely upon a prototype
or volume submitter opinion letter from the IRS with respect to each such
Employee Benefit Plan as to its qualified status under the Code, including
all amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and
subsequent legislation for the most recent cycle applicable to such qualified
plan pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2005-66 (as amended or otherwise revised
by subsequent IRS guidance), any such letter has not been revoked (nor, to the
Knowledge of Community, has revocation been threatened) and no fact or event
has occurred since the date of such letter or letters from the IRS that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Employee Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

 

(d) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, Community and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects, and are now in material
compliance with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all Laws and regulations
applicable to such Employee Benefit Plans and each Employee Benefit Plan has
been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms.
There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan or the imposition of any lien on the
assets of Community or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. None
of Community or any of its Subsidiaries has

 



38  engaged in a transaction with respect to any applicable Employee Benefit
Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the
date hereof, would subject Community or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.

 

(e) All contributions required to be made to any Employee Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Employee Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been accrued on the
Community Financial Statements to the extent required under GAAP. Each
Employee Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section
3(1) of ERISA is either (i) funded through an insurance company contract and
is not a "welfare benefit fund" with the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or
(ii) unfunded.

 

(f) (i) No Employee Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a
plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not
under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple
Employer Plan"); (ii) none of Community or its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan; (iii) none of Community and its Subsidiaries nor any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability
that has not been satisfied in full; and (iv) no Employee Benefit Plan is
subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or to Sections 412 or 430 of the
Code. "ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to any entity, trade or business,
any other entity, trade or business that is a member of a group described
in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA
that includes the first entity, trade or business, or that is a member of the
same "controlled group" as the first entity, trade or business pursuant to
Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA. "Withdrawal Liability" means liability to a
Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such
Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E
of Title IV of ERISA.

(g) There does not exist, nor, to the Knowledge of Community, do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in, any
Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Community or its
Subsidiaries following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither Community nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in
Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. "Controlled Group Liability"
means any and all liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under section
302 of ERISA, (iii) under sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) as a result
of a failure to comply with the continuation coverage requirements of section
601 et seq. of ERISA and section 4980B of the Code, (v) as a result of a
failure to comply with the group health care coverage requirements of sections
4980D or 4890H of the Code and (vi) under corresponding or similar provisions
of foreign Laws or regulations. 

(h) None of Community and its Subsidiaries has any liability for life,
health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or
beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage
as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of

 



39  Title I of ERISA and at no expense to Community and its Subsidiaries. Except
as Previously Disclosed, Community and each of its Subsidiaries has reserved
the right to amend, terminate or modify at any time all plans or arrangements
providing for post-retirement welfare benefits.

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any liability
to Community or any of its Subsidiaries, there are no pending or threatened
claims (other than routine undisputed claims for benefits in the ordinary
course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted, threatened or
instituted, and to the Knowledge of Community, no set of circumstances exists
which may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit against the Employee
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the
Employee Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Employee Benefit Plans. Neither Community nor any of its Subsidiaries has
taken any action to take corrective action or make a filing under any
voluntary correction program of the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or any
other Governmental Authority with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, and
neither Community nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Knowledge of any plan
defect that would qualify for correction under any such program. No audit or
other proceeding by a Governmental Authority is pending or, to Communitys
Knowledge, threatened with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

 

(j) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and
associated Treasury Department guidance has been operated in compliance with,
and is in documentary compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and IRS
regulations and guidance thereunder. No compensation payable by Community or
any of its Subsidiaries has been reported as nonqualified deferred
compensation in the gross income of any individual or entity, and subject to
an additional tax, as a result of the operation of Section 409A of the Code,
and no arrangement exists with respect to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan that would result in income inclusion under Section 409A(b)
of the Code.

 

(k) Except as Previously Disclosed on Section 4.11(k) of the Community
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or
together with any other event or events, will (i) result in any payment
(including, without limitation, severance, change in control, forgiveness of
indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due under any Employee Benefit Plan,
whether or not such payment is contingent, (ii) increase any payments or
benefits otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit Plan, (iii) result
in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any
benefits including, but not limited to, the acceleration of the vesting and
exercisability of any equity awards, whether or not contingent, (iv) result in
any limitation on the right of Community or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Employee Benefit
Plan or related trust, (v) require the funding of any trust or other funding
vehicle or (vi) limit or restrict the right of Community or, after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, to merge, amend or terminate any of the Employee
Benefit Plans. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Merger, either alone or in combination with another event
will result in any payment or benefit (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1) that would, individually or
in combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the

 



40  Code) that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. As of the
Closing, Community shall have received, as of a date no earlier than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the written confirmation of a
nationally recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent that no
agreement, Contract or arrangement to which any employee of Community is a
party will result in the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
by reason of Section 280G of the Code. No Employee Benefit Plan provides for
the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code,
or otherwise.

 

(l) Each individual who renders services to Community or any of its
Subsidiaries who is classified by Community or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, as having the status of an independent contractor or other non-
employee status for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation and tax
reporting and participation under Employee Benefit Plans) is properly so
characterized.

(m) All cash bonuses and other incentive compensation that are payable by
Community on a quarterly or monthly basis have been, and will be paid, solely
pursuant to the Communitys Incentive and Commission Plan, a true and complete
copy of which has been furnished by Community to Parent and Citizens (such
plan, the "Community Incentive and Commission Plan").

4.12 Approvals. As of the date of this Agreement, Community has no
Knowledge why all regulatory approvals from any Governmental Authority
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement should not be obtained on a timely basis. 

4.13 Opinion. The Community Board has received the opinion of D.A. Davidson
and Co. that, as of the date hereof, and based upon and subject to the factors
and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the
holders of the Community Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders. 

4.14 Community Information. The information relating to Community and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Community or its representatives for
inclusion in the Prospectus/Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement, or in any application, notification or other document filed with
any other Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
are made, not misleading. The portions of the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus/Joint Proxy Statement relating to Community and its Subsidiaries
and other portions within the reasonable control of Community and its
Subsidiaries will comply in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder..

 

4.15 Legal Proceedings.

Benefit Plan"), Parent and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects, and are now in substantial compliance with all provisions of ERISA,
the Code and all Laws and regulations applicable to such Parent Benefit Plans,
and each Parent Benefit Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms. All contributions required to be made
prior to the date hereof to any Parent Benefit Plan by applicable Law or
regulation or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all
premiums due and payable prior to the date hereof with respect to insurance
policies funding any Parent Benefit Plan, have been timely made or paid in
full. Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any liability to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, there are no pending or threatened claims
(other than routine undisputed claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted, threatened or instituted,
and to the Knowledge of Parent, no set of circumstances exists which may
reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit against the Parent Benefit Plans,
any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Parent Benefit
Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Parent Benefit
Plans.

 

(b) No Parent Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer

Plan; (iii) none of Parent and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been
satisfied in full; and (iv) no Parent Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or

and its Subsidiaries has any liability for life, health, medical or other
welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof,
except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of
the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

5.20 Insurance. Except as Previously Disclosed, (a) Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries is, and at all times within five (5) years hereof each has been,
insured with insurers and has insurance coverage adequate to insure against
all risks normally insured against by companies reasonably consistent with
industry practice, (b) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default under any policy of insurance or bond such that it could be cancelled,
and all such insurance policies and bonds maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and, except for expirations in the
ordinary course, will remain so through and after the Closing, and (c) Parent
and each of its Subsidiaries has filed claims with, or given notice of claims
to, its insurers with respect to all material matters and occurrences for
which it believes it has coverage.

 

5.21 Reorganization. To Parents Knowledge, none of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action, or is aware of any fact
or circumstance, that would prevent or impede, or could reasonably be expected
to prevent or impede, the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



 



72 5.22 Representations and Warranties. To the Knowledge of Parent, the
materials prepared by Parent and Citizens and made available in the data room
to Community in the course of its due diligence investigation of Parent and
Citizens contain no statements of material fact which are untrue. Except for
the representations and warranties in this Article 5, neither Parent nor any
other Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or

warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, and
except for the representations and warranties made by Parent in this Article
5, neither Parent nor any Person makes or has made any representation to

its business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably request.
Neither Community nor Parent, nor any of Parents Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information to the extent such
access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such
party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Parent and Citizens shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with
Communitys regular business operations during any such access to Communitys
property, books and records.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, but in
no event more than twenty (20) days after the end of each calendar month
ending after the date hereof and at least seven (7) Business Days before the
Closing, Community will furnish to Parent and Citizens: (i) consolidated
financial statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and
stockholders equity) of as of and for such month then ended (including the
month ended immediately prior to the Closing Date) (the "Monthly Financial
Statements"); (ii) internal management reports showing actual financial
performance against plan; (iii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any
reports provided to the Community Board or any committee thereof relating to
the financial performance and risk management of it or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (v) a listing of all new and renewed loans and loan
modifications, loan payoffs (meaning a closed paid note) and loan purchases
with a balance of $250,000 or greater that were completed or made during the
preceding month. Community shall also furnish to Parent and Citizens copies of
all Call Reports that will be filed after the date hereof with any Regulatory
Agencies, including all financial statements included in such Call Reports
and any related work papers. Community shall also undertake all commercially
reasonable efforts to complete the audit of its consolidated financial
statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and
stockholders equity) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the
"2017 Audited Financial Statements"), as promptly as practicable and by no
later than March 15, 2018. Each of the Monthly Financial Statements, the
financial statements contained in any Call Report filed by Community after
the date hereof, and 2017 Audited Financial Statements shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and regulatory accounting principles and other applicable
legal and accounting requirements, and reflect all period-end accruals and
other adjustments. Such financial statements shall be accompanied by a
certificate of Communitys chief financial officer to the effect that
such financial statements continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of
the certificate, the financial condition of Community in all material
respects. Such financial statements shall also reflect accruals for all
Transaction Expenses incurred as of the date of such financial statements in
accordance with GAAP.

(c) All nonpublic information and materials provided pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
entered into between the Parties dated October 30, 2017 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

 

(d) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall affect
or be deemed to modify or waive any representations, warranties or covenants
of the other party set forth in this Agreement.



 



82 6.05 Regulatory Matters.

 

(a) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably possible, and to comply
with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals,
and authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental Authorities;
provided, however, any initial filings with Governmental Authorities in
connection with the Merger shall be made by Parent and Citizens within thirty
(30) calendar days after the date hereof. Each of Parent and Community shall,
upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Community or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Community and Parent shall have the right to review in advance and, to the
extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws, all the non-confidential information relating to Community
or Parent (excluding any confidential financial information relating to
individuals), as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries,
that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The Parties
shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations (collectively the "Approvals") of all
third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each Party will keep the other reasonably apprised of the status
of matters relating to such Approvals and the completion of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to
take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
Governmental Authorities that would reasonably be likely, in each case
following the Effective Time (but regardless when the action, condition or
restriction is to be taken or implemented), to (i) have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) require Parent, Citizens or the Surviving Corporation
to raise additional capital or accept any restrictions on its ability to
operate its businesses, in each case, that would materially reduce the
economic benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby to Parent and
Citizens to such a degree that Parent and Citizens, in good faith after
consultation with Community, would not have entered into this Agreement had
such conditions, restrictions or requirements been known at the date hereof
(any of clauses (i) or (ii), a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition").

(c) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time
or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, (i) the Parties shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to comply in all material
respects with any commitments or 

 



83  obligations under any Regulatory Agreement or CRA Agreement, and shall
exercise their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any unresolved
violation, criticism or exception thereunder; (ii) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Parties shall keep each other informed of the status and
progress of its compliance with any such CRA-related commitments or
obligations; (iii) each Party shall promptly provide the other Parties of any
notice, or other Knowledge of such Party, of any planned or threatened
objection by any community group to the transactions contemplated hereby; and
(iv) each Party shall cooperate with the other Parties to address and resolve
any such protests as promptly as practicable, including by providing access to
such information and employees of such Party as another Party may reasonably
request.

 

6.06 Registration Statement.

 

(a) Community and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Prospectus/Joint Proxy Statement (as defined below), and Parent shall prepare
and file with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with
the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger (including the joint proxy statement and prospectus (the
"Prospectus/Joint Proxy Statement") constituting a part thereof, the
"Registration Statement"), as promptly as practicable after the date hereof.
Each of Parent and Community shall, upon request, furnish to the other all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Prospectus/Joint Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made in connection therewith.

 

(b) Parent and Community each shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and promptly thereafter Community
and Parent shall mail the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to the holders of
Community Common Stock and Parent Common Stock as applicable. Parent shall
reasonably promptly provide Community with copies of any written comments and
advise Community of any oral comments with respect to the Registration
Statement received from the SEC. Each Party shall cooperate and provide the
other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement prior to filing such with the SEC.

 

(c) Community and Parent each agrees, for itself and its Subsidiaries, that
(i) the Registration Statement will not, at the time the Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case with
respect to the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement, and (ii) the Prospectus/Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto will not, at the date of mailing to Community and Parent
shareholders and at the time of the Community Shareholder Meeting and Parent
Shareholder Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, in each case with respect to the information supplied or to be
supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Prospectus/Joint Proxy Statement. Community and 

 



84  Parent will cause the Registration Statement to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Community and Parent agrees that if
such Party shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of any information
furnished by such Party that would cause any of the statements in the
Prospectus/Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, or that would result in an omission to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other Party thereof and to take the necessary steps to
correct the Prospectus/Joint Proxy Statement.

6.07 Community Shareholder Approval.

 

(a) Community shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Community Articles and Community Bylaws, all actions necessary to convene a
duly called meeting or meetings of its shareholders (the "Community
Shareholder Meeting") to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective (but in no event later than
forty-five (45) days after the Registration Statement is declared effective)
for the purpose of obtaining the Community Shareholder Approval.

 

(b) Except to the extent specifically contemplated in Section 6.09 in the
case of a Community Change in Recommendation, the Community Board shall at
all times prior to and during such Community Shareholder Meeting recommend
such approval and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and
obtain from the shareholders of Community the Community Shareholder Approval
(the "Community Board Recommendation"), including by communicating to its
shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Prospectus/Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve the plan of
Merger set forth in this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has
terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement and the Merger
shall be submitted to Communitys shareholders at the Community Shareholder
Meeting whether or not (i) the Community Board shall have effected an Adverse
Change of Recommendation or (ii) any Community Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted to Community or
any of its advisors. Community shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, adjourn or postpone the Community Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ that
Community may, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or
postpone the Community Shareholder Meeting (A) if on the date on which
Community Shareholder Meeting is originally scheduled, Community has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Community
Common Stock to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the
Community Shareholder Meeting l, (B) after consultation with Parent, if the
failure to adjourn or postpone Community Shareholder Meeting would reasonably
be expected to be a violation of applicable Law for the distribution of any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement, or (C) after
consultation with Parent, for a single period not to exceed ten (10) Business
Days, to solicit additional proxies if necessary to obtain the Community
Shareholder Approval. Parent may require Community to adjourn, delay or
postpone Community Shareholder Meeting once for a period not to exceed
ten (10) Business Days (but prior to the date that is five (5) Business Days
prior to the Outside Date) to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain
the Community Shareholder Approval. Once Community has established the record
date for determining shareholders of Community entitled to vote at the
Community Shareholder Meeting, Community shall not change such record date or
establish a

 



81  different record date for the Community Shareholder Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law or
the Community Articles or Community Bylaws. 

(c) Community shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to
Parent to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to
the Community Shareholder Approval. Community and Parent shall each use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Community Shareholder Meeting and
the Parent Shareholder Meeting to be held within ten 

   (10) | Business Days of each meeting. 
---|--- 

6.08 Parent Shareholder Approval. The Parent Board has resolved to
recommend to Parents shareholders that they approve the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and will submit to its
shareholders the proposed issuance of the Parent Common Stock and any other
matters required to be approved by its shareholders in order to carry out the
intentions of this Agreement. Parent shall duly take, in accordance with
applicable Law, the Parent Articles, and the Parent Bylaws, all action
necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared
effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Parent Vote (the "Parent
Shareholder Meeting") (but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after
the Registration Statement is declared effective). The Parent Board will use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the Parent
Shareholder Approval, including by communicating to its shareholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Prospectus/Joint
Proxy Statement). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless
this Agreement has terminated in accordance with its terms, the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger and any other matters required to be
approved by Parents shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of
this Agreement shall be submitted to Parents shareholders at the Parent
Shareholder Meeting. Parent shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably
acceptable to Community to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
shareholders relating to the Parent Shareholder Approval. Community and
Parent shall each use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Community Shareholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting to be held
within ten (10) Business Days of each meeting.

 

6.09 No Solicitation.

 

(a) Community agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
the officers, directors or employees of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and
that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors, representatives (including any investment banker, attorney
or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) and Affiliates, not
to, directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries
with respect to, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a transaction to effect, (A) a
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving it or any of
its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would result in any Person (or the
stockholders of such Person) beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of
equity securities or any amount of securities representing 15% or more of the
total voting power of it (or of the

 



86  surviving parent entity in such transaction) or of any of its Subsidiaries,
or (B) any purchase or sale or other acquisition of 15% or more of the
consolidated assets (including stock of its Subsidiaries) of it and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (C) any purchase or sale of, or tender or
exchange offer for, or other acquisition of, its voting securities that, if
consummated, would result in any Person (or the stockholders of such Person)
beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities or any
amount of securities representing 15% or more of the total voting power of it
(or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or of any of
its Subsidiaries, or (D) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of it (any
such proposal, offer or transaction in any of the preceding clauses (A), (B),
(C) or (D) (other than a proposal or offer made by Parent or an Affiliate
thereof) being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"),

(ii) engage or enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any Person
relating to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or otherwise cooperate
with or assist or participate in, or encourage or knowingly facilitate any
such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or
attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal or any other proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or

 

(iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose to approve, endorse or
recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement,
option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition
Proposal or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Subject to Section 6.09(c) below, Community will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Parent and
Citizens with respect to any Community Acquisition Proposal and will, subject
to applicable Law, (i) enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement
relating to a Community Acquisition Proposal and (ii) within ten (10) Business
Days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of
any confidential information provided to any Person (other than Parent and
its Affiliates) pursuant to any such confidentiality or similar agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Community Board shall be permitted, at any time prior to the Community
Shareholder Approval, and subject to compliance by Community with the other
terms of this Section 6.09 and to Community first entering into a
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent) with
the Person making the Acquisition Proposal described on terms no less
restrictive to the counterparty than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and that expressly permits Community to comply with its obligations
under this Section 6.09, to engage in discussions and negotiations with, or
provide any nonpublic information or data to, any Person in response to
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such Person made or
renewed after the date of this Agreement and which the Community Board (i)
concludes in good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal and (ii) determines that engaging in such discussions and
negotiations with, or providing such nonpublic information or

 



87  data to, such Person is necessary in order for the Community Board to comply
with its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable Law.

 

(d) Community shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
twenty four (24) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to Community or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Person that informs Community or any of its Subsidiaries
that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry from any Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with
Community relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal or any other indication
that any Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
it. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall
indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry
or request and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals
or offers. Community shall also promptly, and in any event within twenty four
(24) hours, notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into
discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides
nonpublic information or data to any Person in accordance with Section
6.09(c) (and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all material nonpublic
information so provided not previously provided to Parent) and shall keep
Parent promptly and fully informed of the status and terms of any such
proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including
by providing within twenty four (24) hours of receipt, a summary of all
material terms of such proposals or offers (including any material changes in
any terms), together with copies of all such proposals or offers if in
writing (including all draft agreements). At least five (5) Business Days
prior to each meeting of the Community Board at which the Community Board
shall consider and determine whether any offer constitutes a Superior
Proposal, Community shall provide Parent with a written notice specifying the
date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting, the
material terms and conditions of the offer that is the basis of the potential
action by the Community Board (including a copy of any draft definitive
agreement reflecting the offer) and the identity of the Person making the
offer.

 

(e) Subject to Section 6.09(f), neither the Community Board nor any
committee of either thereof shall:

 

(i) withdraw, modify or qualify the Community Board Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent, or adopt a resolution to withdraw, modify or
qualify the Community Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or
take any other action that is or becomes disclosed publicly and which can
reasonably be interpreted as indicating that the Community Board or any
committee thereof does not support the Merger and this Agreement or does not
believe that the Merger and this Agreement are in the best interests of its
shareholders;

 

(ii) fail to reaffirm, without qualification, the Community Board
Recommendation or fail to state publicly, without qualification, that the
Merger and this Agreement are in the best interests of its shareholders within
five (5) Business Days after Parent requests in writing that such action be
taken;

 



 



88 (iii) fail to announce publicly within ten (10) Business Days after a
tender offer or exchange offer relating to the Community Common Stock shall
have been commenced, that it recommends rejection of such tender or exchange
offer;

 

(iv) fail to issue within ten (10) Business Days after an Acquisition
Proposal is publicly announced with respect to Community a press release
announcing its opposition to such Acquisition Proposal;

(v) approve, endorse or recommend any such Acquisition Proposal with
respect to Community; or

(vi) resolve to take any action described in _clauses (i)_ through _(v)_
of this sentence (each of the foregoing actions described in _clauses (i)_
through _(vi)_ of this sentence being referred to herein as a "Community
Change in Recommendation").

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the Community Shareholder Approval, the Community Board
may effect a Community Change in Recommendation if:

 

(i) after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide written
offer to effect a transaction of the type referred to in the definition of
the term Superior Proposal is made to Community and is not withdrawn;

(ii) such unsolicited, bona fide, written offer was not obtained or made
as a direct or indirect result of a breach of, or any action inconsistent
with, this Agreement;

 

(iii) Community has complied with its obligations to provide notices to
Parent of any Acquisition Proposal and other matters requiring notice under
this Section 6.09;

(iv) at least two (2) Business Days prior to each meeting of the Community
Board at which the Community Board shall consider and determine whether any
such offer constitutes a Superior Proposal, Community provides the Parent with
a written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons
for holding such meeting, the material terms and conditions of the offer that
is the basis of the potential action by the Community Board (including a copy
of any draft definitive agreement reflecting the offer) and the identity of
the Person making the offer (it being agreed that any material change to the
terms and conditions of such offer shall require a new notice and new two (2)
Business Day period);

 

(v) the Community Board determines in good faith, after obtaining and
taking into account the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and its outside legal counsel, that such offer
constitutes a Superior Proposal;

 

(vi) the Community Board does not effect, or cause Community to effect, a
Community Change in Recommendation at any time within three (3) Business Days
after Parent receives written notice from Community confirming that the
Community Board has determined that such offer is a Superior Proposal and
intends to effect a Community Change in Recommendation;

 



 



89 (vii) during such five (5) Business Day period, if requested by Parent,
Community engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was determined to constitute a
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal;

 

(viii) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period, such offer has not
been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a
result of the negotiations required by clause (vii) or otherwise); and

 

(ix) the Community Board reasonably determines in good faith, after
obtaining and taking into account the advice of its outside legal counsel
that, in light of such Superior Proposal, a Community Change in Recommendation
is required in order for the Community Board to comply with its fiduciary
duties to its shareholders under applicable Law.

 

(g) Nothing in this Section 6.09 (but subject to the terms set forth in
Section 8.01) shall (i) permit Community to terminate this Agreement or (ii)
affect any other obligation of Community under this Agreement. Unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, Community shall not
submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than
the Merger.

6.10 Takeover Laws. At all times prior to the Effective Time, Community
and Parent (as to themselves) shall: (a) take all reasonable action necessary
to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger; and
(b) if any Takeover Law becomes applicable to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger, take all
reasonable action necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger.

 

6.11 Schedule Updates. Not later than the tenth (10th) day of each calendar
month between March 31, 2018 and the Closing Date, and at least seven (7)
Business Days prior to the Closing (or with respect to matters requiring
updating as of the Determination Date, on the Determination Date), Community
shall provide to Parent and Citizens a supplemental Community Disclosure
Schedule reflecting any required changes thereto between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date which would have been required to be set forth
or described in such disclosure schedule or which is necessary to correct any
information in any Community representation or warranty or such disclosure
schedule which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. Delivery of such
supplemental disclosure schedules shall not cure a breach or modify a
representation or warranty of this Agreement or for determining the
satisfaction of any conditions to consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or otherwise affect the respective rights,
obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
Parties hereto. Any information set forth in any one section of Community
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other applicable section
or subsection of Community Disclosure Schedule, respectively, if its
relevance to the information called for in such section or

 



90  subsection is reasonably apparent on its face notwithstanding the omission
of any cross-reference to such other section.

 

6.12 Certain Policies. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and provided
that Parent has confirmed in writing that all conditions to its obligations
to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived and that it is prepared to
effect the Merger, Community shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and
regulations of the SEC and the rules and regulations of the CDBO, FDIC and
applicable banking Law, modify or change its loan, other real estate owned,
accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and
practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to
be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Citizens; provided,
however, that unless the modification or changes would otherwise be necessary
to be consistent with applicable Law or with regulatory accounting principles
and GAAP, no such modification or change shall constitute or be deemed to be
a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or
failure to satisfy shall have occurred, or as an admission or acknowledgement
by Community that any such modification or change is appropriate or required
or that any financial statement or information previously provided by
Community was incorrect in any respect.

6.13 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of Community and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when
acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent they are indemnified on the date
hereof to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances (including to Citizens, as successor-in-interest to Community)
if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification. Further, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume,
perform and observe the obligations of Community under the Community Articles,
the Community Bylaws and the agreements in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and set forth in Schedule 6.13(a) of the Community Disclosure
Schedule to indemnify those Persons who are or have been at any time been
directors and officers of Community for their acts and omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time in their capacity as directors or officers.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall provide that portion of directors and officers
liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") that serves to reimburse the present and
former officers and directors (determined as of the Effective Time) of
Community with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising
from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time, which DandO
Insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain
terms 

 



91  and conditions no less advantageous to such officers and directors, as that
coverage currently provided by Community; provided, however, that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the
aggregate for such six (6)-year period more than 300% of the current amount
expended on an annual basis by Community to maintain or procure such DandO
Insurance; provided, further, that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation is
unable to maintain or obtain the DandO Insurance called for by this Section
6.13, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as is available at a cost in the aggregate for such six
(6)-year period up to 300% of the current annual premium; provided, further,
that officers and directors of Community may be required to make application
and provide customary representations and warranties to Parent or the
Surviving Corporations insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such
DandO Insurance. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent shall or, with the prior
written consent of Parent, Community may, purchase, at or prior to the
Effective Time, a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of the
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Community and
its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective
Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding 300% of the
current annual premium for such insurance (or as much comparable insurance as
is available at a cost in the aggregate for such six (6) year period up to
300% of the current annual premium). If such prepaid "tail" policy has been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay
for insurance pursuant to this Section 6.13(b). If Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or
merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.13. The provisions of this Section
6.13 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified
Person may have by contract or otherwise.

 

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.13(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, will promptly notify Parent or the Surviving
Corporation thereof; _provided_ that failure to so notify will not affect the
obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under Section 6.13(a)
unless and to the extent that Parent or the Surviving Corporation is actually
and materially prejudiced as a consequence. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however,
that none of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim for which indemnification
has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such 

 



92  Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate
in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have
any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

6.14 Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or pursuant to the terms
of such Employee Benefit Plans, all Employee Benefit Plans of Community will
be discontinued and employees of Community who become employees of Citizens on
the Closing Date (such employees "Continuing Employees") shall become eligible
for the employee benefit plans of Citizens beginning on the first day of the
month immediately after the Closing Date on the same terms as such plans and
benefits are generally offered from time to time to employees of Citizens in
comparable positions with Citizens; _provided_ , however, that Continuing
Employees will be eligible to participate in any severance plans of Citizens
immediately after the Closing Date on the same terms as such plans and
benefits are generally offered from time to time to employees of Citizens
in comparable positions with Citizens. Effective as of a date no later than
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Community shall terminate its
401(k) Plan (the "Community 401(k) Plan") and shall provide Parent with
evidence that the Community 401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to
resolutions of the Community Board. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to the review and reasonable approval of Parent. Community
shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating the Community
401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require. For purposes of determining such
employees eligibility and vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under the
employee benefit plans of Citizens and entitlement to severance benefits and
vacation entitlement (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), Citizens
shall recognize such employees years of service with Community beginning on
the date such employees commenced employment with Community through the
Closing Date. Citizens shall take any actions necessary to allow the former
participants in the Community 401(k) Plan who become eligible to
participate in Citizens 401(k) Plan to make rollover contributions (but not
including the rollover of participant loans) in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Citizens 401(k) Plan.

 

(b) Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, Citizens shall take such
commercially reasonable actions as are necessary to cause the group health
plan maintained by Citizens or an Affiliate thereof, and applicable insurance
carriers, third party administrators and any other third parties, to the
extent such group health plan is made available to employees of Community on
or after the first day of the month immediately after the Closing Date, to (i)
waive any evidence of insurability requirements, waiting periods, and any
limitations as to preexisting medical conditions under the group health plan
applicable to individuals who are employees of Community on the Closing Date
and their spouses and eligible dependents (but only to the extent that such
preexisting condition limitations did not apply or were satisfied under the
group health plan maintained by Community prior to the Closing); and (ii)
provide individuals who are

 



93  employees of Community on the Closing Date with credit, for the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs, for the amount of any out-of-pocket
expenses and copayments or deductible expenses that are incurred by them and
their spouses and eligible dependents during the calendar year in which
the Closing occurs under a group health plan maintained by Citizens or any of
its Affiliates.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.07, the provisions of
this Section 6.14 are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement,
and no current or former employee, independent contractor or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any employee benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent,
Community or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the
ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing
Date, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify
or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Closing Date; (iii) confer upon any current or former employee, independent
contractor or other service provider any right to employment or continued
employment or continued service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries), or constitute; or (iv) create an employment or other agreement
with any employee, independent contractor or other service provider. No
provision of this Agreement will be deemed to change the "at will" status of
any Continuing Employee.

 

6.15 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of Community and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to
it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in a Community
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be; or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.

 

6.16 Third-Party Agreements.

 

(a) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) the
consents or waivers required to be obtained from any third parties in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (in
such form and content as mutually agreed by the Parties) promptly after the
date of this Agreement; and (ii) the cooperation of such third parties
(including at Parents request, with respect to the termination of Contracts
following the Effective Time) to effect a smooth transition in accordance with
the Parties timetable at or after the Effective Time.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.16(a), each of the Parties
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide data processing,
item processing and other processing support or outside contractors to assist
in performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful
conversion of the data and other files and records of Community and its
Subsidiaries to Parents and Citizens production environment, in such a
manner sufficient to ensure that a successful conversion will occur at the
time (on or after the Effective Time) mutually agreed by the Parties, subject
to any applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the

 



94  exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition. Among other
things, Community shall:

 

(i) reasonably cooperate with Parent and Citizens to establish a

 

mutually agreeable project plan to effectuate the conversion;

 

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to have Communitys outside
contractors continue to support both the conversion effort and its ongoing
needs until the conversion can be established;

(iii) provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from
any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably
requested by Parent and Citizens for use in planning the conversion, as soon
as reasonably practicable;

 

(iv) provide reasonable access to Communitys personnel and facilities and,
with the consent of its outside contractors, its outside contractors
personnel and facilities, to enable the conversion effort to be completed on
schedule; and

 

(v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the Contracts of outside
data, item and other processing contractors or other third-party vendors to
which Community or any of its Subsidiaries are bound when directed to do so by
Parent or Citizens.

 

(c) Each of Parent and Citizens agrees that all actions taken pursuant to
this Section 6.16 shall be taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption
to the customary business activities of Community and its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Community shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consents, approvals or waivers from the agreements set forth in Section
6.16(d) of Community Disclosure Schedule and lessor estoppel certificates, in

not earlier than twenty (20) calendar days nor later than five (5) calendar
days prior to the Closing Date.

NASDAQ any required notices or forms with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

 

6.18 Press Releases. Community and Parent shall consult with each other

Agreement and (except with respect to a Community Change in Recommendation,
subject to compliance with Section 6.09) and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statements without the prior consent of the
other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided, however, that a Party may, without the prior consent of the other
Party (but after such consultation, to the extent practicable in
the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statements
as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of NASDAQ or the SEC. Community and Parent shall cooperate to
develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management
available at presentations

 



95  related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably
requested by the other Party.

 

6.19 Board Member Appointment. Effective as of the Effective Time, the
Parent Board and the Citizens Board shall take all action necessary to
appoint one individual serving as a director of Community on the date of this
Agreement and set forth on Section 6.19 of the Community Disclosure Schedule,
until his successor has been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
his earlier death, resignation or removal, in each case, in accordance with
the Parent Articles and Parent Bylaws and the Citizens Articles and the
Citizens Bylaws, as applicable. Subject to the fiduciary duties of the Parent
Board, Parent shall include such individual on the list of nominees for
directors presented by the Parent Board and for which the Parent Board shall
solicit proxies at the first annual meeting of Parent following the Effective
Time.

 

6.20 Section 16 Matters. The Parent Board shall, prior to the Effective
Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act to exempt the conversion of shares of
Community Common Stock into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement by officers and directors of Community who may become
and officer or director of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. In further of the foregoing, prior to the

is to be exempted, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
acquired by each such individual and (C) that the approval is granted for

reasonably necessary for Parents Board to set forth the information required
in the resolutions of Parent Board.

 

6.21 Shareholder Litigation and Protests. Parent and Community shall each
promptly notify the other Party in writing of any threatened or commenced
litigation, or of any claim, controversy or contingent liability or any
community-based protests that might reasonably be expected to be asserted or
become the subject of litigation or regulatory review or filings with any
Governmental Authority, against the notifying Party or affecting any of its
properties, Subsidiaries or Affiliates and each of Parent and Community shall
promptly notify the other Party of any legal action, suit or proceeding
or judicial, administrative or governmental investigation, pending or, to the
Knowledge of the notifying Party, threatened against the notifying Party (or
any of its Subsidiaries) that questions or might question the validity of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any actions taken or to
be taken by the notifying Party pursuant hereto or seeks to enjoin, materially
delay or otherwise restrain the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. Each of Parent and Community shall give the other Party
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against such Party or its directors or officers relating to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
Parent or Community, or any of their Subsidiaries, may enter into any
settlement agreement in respect of any shareholder litigation against such
Party or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or the other 

 



96  transactions contemplated by this Agreement without such other Partys prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). For
purposes of this Section 6.21, "participate" means that the non-litigating
Party will be kept apprised of the proposed strategy and other significant
decisions with respect to the litigation by the litigating Party (to the
extent the attorney-client privilege, work product or other similar privilege
between the litigating party and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise
affected and to the extent permitted by law), and the non-litigating Party may
offer comments or suggestions with respect to the litigation but will not be
afforded any decision-making power or other authority over the litigation
except for the settlement consent set forth above

Effect shall have been made or obtained (as the case may be) and shall remain

TERMINATION

 

8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Community or Parent:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent, Citizens and Community at any time in a
written instruction authorized by the Community Board, Parent Board and
Citizens Board;

(b) by action of the Community Board or Parent Board, in the event that
the Merger is not consummated by October 31, 2018 (the "Outside Date");
provided that the Outside Date may be extended to December 31, 2018 by either
Parent or Community by written notice to the other party if the Closing shall
not have occurred by such date, and on such date the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01(b) have not been satisfied or waived and each of the other
conditions to consummation of the Merger set forth in Article 7 has
been satisfied, waived or remains capable of being satisfied, except to the
extent that the failure of the Merger then to be consummated arises out of or
results from the knowing action or inaction of the Party seeking to terminate
pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) which action or inaction is in violation of
its obligations under this Agreement;

(c) by action of the Community Board or Parent Board if the approval of
any Governmental Authority required for consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied by
final and nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority, or an
application thereof shall have been permanently withdrawn by mutual agreement
of Parent and Community at the request or suggestion of a Governmental
Authority; provided, however, that no party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) if such denial shall be due to
the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants of such party under this Agreement;

 



102 (d) by action of the Community Board or Parent Board if the
Community Shareholder Approval or Parent Shareholder Approval is not obtained
at the duly convened Community Shareholder Meeting or Parent Shareholder
Meeting, respectively;

 

(e) by action of the Community Board or Parent Board, if there shall have
been a breach by the other Party of any of the covenants or agreements or any
of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part
of such other Party, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate,
would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure
of the condition set forth in Sections 7.01, 7.02, or 7.03, as the case may
be, and which breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days following
written notice thereof (or such shorter period as remaining prior to
the Outside Date) to the breaching Party or, by its nature, cannot be
reasonably cured within such time period; provided further that the
terminating Party is not then in material breach of any representation
warranty, covenant or agreement which would result in, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.01, 7.02 or 7.03;

 

(f) at any time prior to the Community Shareholder Approval, by action of
the Parent Board, in the event (i) Community shall have breached in any
material respect Section 6.09; (ii) the Community Board shall have effected a
Community Change in Recommendation;

 

(iii) at any time after the end of ten (10) Business Days following receipt
of an Acquisition Proposal, the Community Board shall have failed to reaffirm
its Community Board Recommendation as promptly as practicable (but in any
event within five (5) Business Days) after receipt of any written request to
do so by Parent; or (iv) a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding
shares of Community Common Stock shall have been publicly disclosed (other
than by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent) and the Community Board recommends
that its shareholders tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer
or, within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, the Community Board fails to recommend against acceptance of
such offer;

 

(g) by action of the Community Board, prior to such time that the Community
Shareholder Approval has been obtained, in order to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for a Superior Proposal; provided that (i) such Superior
Proposal shall not have resulted from any breach of Section 6.09, (ii) the
Community Board, after satisfying all of the requirements set forth in
Section 6.09, shall have authorized Community to enter into a binding written
definitive acquisition agreement providing for the consummation of a
transaction constituting a Superior Proposal; and (iii) such termination
shall not be effective until Community has paid the Termination Fee required
by Section 8.03(b) to Parent;

 

(h) by action of either the Parent Board or the Community Board, by written
notice to other Party on the Business Day immediately following the
Determination Date, effective as of the date that is five (5) Business Days
following the date of such written notice, in the event that:

 

(i) The Parent Average Closing Price is less than $20.13 per share (with a
proportionate adjustment in the event that outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of
any stock dividend,

 



103  reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement and
the Determination Date); and

(ii) The number obtained by dividing the Parent Average Closing Price by
the Initial Parent Stock Price is less than the number obtained by
subtracting (A) the Index Ratio minus (B) 0.15.

If Community elects to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01(h) and
provides such written notice to Parent, then within two (2) Business Days
following Parents receipt of such notice, Parent may elect by written notice
to Community to reinstate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (A) adjust the Exchange Ratio to equal a number equal to
the lesser of (I) a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth),
the numerator of which is $190.40 and the denominator of which is the Parent
Average Closing Price and (II) a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-
thousandth), the numerator of which is $190.40 and the denominator of which
is the Parent Average Closing Price, multiplied by the Index Ratio, or (B) in
the alternative, not adjust the Exchange Ratio, and, in lieu thereof, add an
amount in cash to the Cash Consideration such that each holder of Community
Common Stock would be entitled to receive, in respect of each share of
Community Common Stock, the equivalent value, based on the Parent Average
Closing Price, for each such share of Community Common Stock as such holder
would have received had the Exchange Ratio been adjusted in accordance with
clause (A). If Parent makes such election to reinstate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no termination will occur
pursuant to this Section 8.01(h) and this Agreement will remain in effect
according to its terms (except as the Merger Consideration has been adjusted).

 

For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings
indicated below:

 

"Determination Date" means the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

"Final Index Price" means the 20-day average closing price of the KBW
Regional Banking Index as quoted on Bloomberg (KRX:IND) as of the
Determination Date.

"Index Ratio" means the Final Index Price divided by the Initial Index Price.

"Initial Index Price" means 115.81.

 

"Initial Parent Stock Price" means $23.68 per share.

 

"Parent Average Closing Price" means the 20-day volume weighted average
closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock as quoted on NASDAQ as of the
Determination Date.

If Parent or any company belonging to the KBW Regional Banking Index declares
or effects a stock dividend, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination
Date, the prices for the common stock of such company will be appropriately
adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 8.01(h).



 



104 8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement
and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article 8, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect with no liability or further obligation of
any kind on the part of any Party (or of any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other
representatives), except (i) that Sections 6.04(c), 8.02, 8.03, and 9.04
through 9.11 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) that no
such termination shall relieve any Party of any liability or damages
resulting from any willful and intentional breach of this Agreement.

or not the Merger is consummated, except as otherwise provided in Section
8.03(b).

(b) Community shall pay a termination fee of $35,132,000 (the
"Termination Fee") to Parent payable by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by Parent in the event of any of the
following:

 

(i) If Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f),
Community shall pay the Termination Fee on the Business Day following such
termination.

(ii) (A) If either Party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(b) or Section 8.01(d) in the event that the Community Shareholder
Approval shall not have been obtained, or if Parent shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or if Community shall terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g); (B) at any time after the date of
this Agreement and at or before the date of the Community Shareholder Meeting
(or the date of termination, if applicable) an Acquisition Proposal (or an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal),
whether or not relating to an Acquisition Proposal received prior to the date
hereof, shall have been made or renewed to Community or the Community Board or
its shareholders and publicly announced or otherwise become publicly known,
and (C) if within eighteen (18) months after the date of such termination of
this Agreement, Community or any of its Subsidiaries executes any definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, such Acquisition Proposal
(substituting for purposes of this clause (C) "50%" for "15%" in the
definition thereof), then Community shall pay Citizens the Termination Fee
upon the first to occur of the date of execution of such definitive agreement
or the date of the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) Community acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section

 

8.03(b) above are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without such agreements Parent would not have entered into
this Agreement, and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty. If
Community fails to pay Parent any amounts due under Section 8.03(b) above
within the time period specified therein, Community shall pay all costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Parent from the date such
amounts were required to be paid in connection with any action, including the
filing of any lawsuit, taken to

 



105  collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any
such unpaid amounts at the publicly announced prime rate of interest printed
in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be made.

(d) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event
shall Community be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not such termination fee may be payable under more than
one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events. 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
in any circumstance in which Parent receives payment of the Termination Fee
in accordance with Section 8.03, the receipt of the Termination Fee in such
circumstance shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Citizens against Community or any of its former, current or future
shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
affiliates or assignees for any and all losses and damages suffered or
incurred as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or otherwise
arising out of, or directly or indirectly relating to, this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

[ _SIGNATURE PAGE TO AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND MERGER_ ] Exhibit A-1

 

Form of Voting and Support Agreement _EXHIBIT A-1 _

 

VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

(WITH REVOCABLE PROXY)

 

This VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT (WITH REVOCABLE PROXY) (this "Agreement") is
made and entered into as of February 26, 2018 by and among CVB Financial
Corp., a California corporation ("Parent"), the shareholder of Community Bank,
a California state-chartered bank ("Community"), that is a signatory to this
Agreement (the "Shareholder"), and solely for purposes of _Sections 7_ and
_11_ , Community.

_Recitals_

 

A. Parent, Citizens Business Bank, a California state-chartered bank and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Citizens") and Community are concurrently
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger (and as it
may be amended, the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of the date of this
Agreement, pursuant to which Community will merge (the "Merger") with and
into Citizens, whereupon each issued and outstanding share of Communitys
common stock ("Community Common Stock") will be converted into the right to
receive the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement.

B. As a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Parent and Citizens have required that each director and certain
executive officers of Community, solely in his or her capacity as a
shareholder and beneficial owner or record holder of Community Common Stock,
enter into, and each has agreed to enter into, this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, for good and valuable
consideration, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1. _Representations and Warranties of the Shareholder_. The Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows: 

(a) _Authority; No Violation_. The Shareholder has all necessary power
and authority to enter into and perform all of the Shareholders obligations
hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Shareholder (and the Shareholders spouse, if the Shares (as defined
below) constitute community property) and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Shareholder and such spouse, enforceable against the
Shareholder and the Shareholders spouse in accordance with its terms, except
to the extent enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and subject to the general principles of equity.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Shareholder
will not violate any other agreement to which the Shareholder is a party,
including any voting agreement, shareholders agreement, trust agreement or
voting trust.

(b) _Ownership of Shares_. As used in this Agreement, "Shares" means the
shares of Community Common Stock which the Shareholder owns of record or
beneficially and has the power to vote (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding
any shares underlying unvested Community RSUs), including the shares of
Community Common Stock owned of record or

 



A-1-1  beneficially, with power to vote, as of the date of this Agreement, which
are listed on Schedule I hereto (the "Existing Shares") and the shares of
Community Common Stock acquired by the Shareholder, with power to vote, after
the date of this Agreement, including any shares acquired upon the vesting of
Community RSUs held by Shareholder. The Existing Shares are owned by the
Shareholder, subject to applicable community property laws, free and clear of
all encumbrances, voting arrangements and commitments of every kind, except as
would not restrict the performance of the Shareholders obligations under this
Agreement. The Shareholder represents and warrants that the Shareholder has
sole or shared power to vote all Existing Shares.

2. _Voting Agreement and Agreement Not to Transfer_. 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Termination Date (as defined
in  _Section_ __ _ 9_ below) (the "Support Period"), the Shareholder hereby
agrees that, at any meeting of Communitys shareholders (and at any
adjournment or postponement thereof), however called, and in any action taken
by written consent of Communitys shareholders in lieu of a meeting, unless
Parent otherwise exercises the Proxy (as defined below), the Shareholder will
vote or cause to be voted all Shares held by the Shareholder as of
the applicable voting record date:

(i) in favor of the approval of the principal terms of the Merger
Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and any other matter that is required to be approved by Communitys
shareholders to facilitate the Merger;

 

(ii) against any action or agreement that to the knowledge of the
Shareholder would result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Community
under this Agreement or the Merger Agreement; and

 

(iii) Except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by the Merger Agreement
or otherwise consented to by Parent, against the following actions (other
than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement):
(A) any extraordinary corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation
or other business combination involving Community; (B) any sale, lease or
transfer of a material amount of the assets of Community; and (C) any other
matter, to the extent that such matter requires a Community shareholder vote,
that to the knowledge of the Shareholder could be reasonably expected to
materially impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely
affect consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement.

 

During the Support Period, the Shareholder shall not enter into any agreement
or understanding with any Person or entity to vote or give instructions after
the Termination Date in any manner inconsistent with _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ ,
or _(iii)_ of the preceding sentence.

 

(b) The Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and
agrees not to exercise or perfect, any rights of appraisal, any dissenters
rights and any similar rights relating to the Merger that the Shareholder may
directly or indirectly have by virtue of the ownership of any Shares if the
Effective Time occurs.

 



 



A-1-2 (c) Except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by the Merger
Agreement or otherwise consented to by Parent, during the Support Period, the
Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly (i) sell, give, transfer,
exchange, pledge, assign, hypothecate, encumber, tender or otherwise dispose
of or encumber or make any offer or agreement relating to any of the
foregoing with respect to the Shares (collectively, a "Transfer"), (ii)
enforce or permit execution of the provisions of any redemption, share
purchase or sale, recapitalization or other agreement with Community or any
other Person or enter into any contract, option or other agreement,
arrangement or understanding with respect to the Transfer of, directly or
indirectly, any of the Shares or any securities convertible into
or exercisable for Shares, any other capital stock of Community or any
interest in any of the foregoing with any Person, (iii) except as set forth
herein, deposit any Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting
agreement or arrangement with respect to such Shares or grant any proxy or
power of attorney with respect thereto, (iv) enter into any swap, contract,
option or other arrangement or undertaking with respect to the direct or
indirect sale, assignment, transfer, exchange or other disposition of or
transfer of any interest in or the voting of any Shares, (v) take any action
that would make any of the Shareholders representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect or
have the effect of preventing or disabling the Shareholder from performing the
Shareholders obligations under this Agreement; _provided however_ , that this
Agreement shall not prohibit the Shareholder from (x) disposing of
or surrendering to Community shares underlying Community RSUs in connection
with the vesting of such Community RSUs for the payment of taxes thereon, if
any, or (y) transferring and delivering Shares to any member of Shareholders
immediate family or to a trust for the benefit of Shareholder or upon the
death of Shareholder; _provided_ that such a Transfer shall only be permitted
if, as a precondition to such Transfer, the transferee agrees in writing, to
be bound by and comply with the provisions of this Agreement. Once Community
Shareholder Approval has been obtained, the prohibitions provided for in
_Section_ __ _ 2(c)_ shall no longer apply to Shareholder.

 

3. _REVOCABLE PROXY_. THE SHAREHOLDER HEREBY REVOKES ANY AND ALL PREVIOUS PROXIES GRANTED WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARES. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SHAREHOLDER HEREBY GRANTS, OR AGREES TO CAUSE THE APPLICABLE RECORD HOLDER TO GRANT, A REVOCABLE PROXY (THE "PROXY") APPOINTING PARENT AS THE SHAREHOLDERS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT AND PROXY, WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION, FOR AND IN THE SHAREHOLDERS NAME, TO VOTE OR OTHERWISE TO UTILIZE SUCH VOTING POWER AS PARENT OR ITS PROXY OR SUBSTITUTE SHALL, IN PARENTS SOLE DISCRETION, DEEM PROPER WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARES TO EFFECT ANY ACTION CONTEMPLATED BY _S ECTION 2(a)_ ABOVE. THE PROXY GRANTED BY THE SHAREHOLDER PURSUANT TO THIS _S ECTION 3_ IS GRANTED IN CONSIDERATION OF PARENT ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND INCURRING CERTAIN RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE PROXY GRANTED BY THE SHAREHOLDER SHALL BE AUTOMATICALLY REVOKED UPON TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS. 

 

4. _No Solicitation_. Except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by the Merger 

 

Agreement, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 6_ hereof, during the Support
Period, Shareholder shall not, and shall not permit any attorney or other
representative retained by Shareholder to, directly or indirectly, (a) take
any of the actions prohibited by [Section 6.09(a)] of the Merger Agreement
that Community has agreed not to take, or (b) participate in, directly
or indirectly, a "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the
rules of the SEC) or powers of attorney or similar

 



A-1-3  rights to vote, or seek to advise or influence any Person with respect to
the voting of, any shares of Community Common Stock in connection with any
matter described in  _Section_ __ _ 2(a)_ of this Agreement, other than to
recommend that shareholders of Community vote in favor of the adoption and
approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, or (c) (i) otherwise
initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any
action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, or (ii) otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to
any Person (other than Parent or Citizens) to any information or data with
respect to Community relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Shareholder agrees
immediately to cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons
other than Parent or Citizens with respect to any possible
Acquisition Proposal and will use Shareholders commercially reasonable
efforts to inform any representative retained by Shareholder of the
obligations undertaken by Shareholder pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4_.

 

5. _Notice of Share Acquisitions_. Shareholder hereby agrees to notify Parent promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) in writing of the number of any additional shares of Community Common Stock or other securities of Community of which Shareholder acquires beneficial or record ownership on or after the date of this Agreement. 

 

6. _Shareholder Capacity_. The Shareholder is entering this Agreement in Shareholders capacity as the record or beneficial owner of the Shareholders Shares, and not in his or her capacity as a director or executive officer, as applicable, of Community or as a trustee of any Community benefit plan. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall be deemed in any manner to limit or affect in any manner the discretion of the Shareholder to take any action, or fail to take any action, in his or her capacity as a director or executive officer, as applicable, of Community or as a trustee of any benefit plan of Community, that Shareholder determines Shareholder should take (or fail to take) in the exercise of Shareholders duties and responsibilities as a director or executive officer, as applicable, of Community or as a trustee of any benefit plan of Community. 

7. _Stop Transfer Order_. In furtherance of this Agreement, Shareholder hereby authorizes and instructs Community to enter a stop transfer order with respect to all of Shareholders Shares for the Support Period, except for such Transfers as are as otherwise provided for or permitted by this Agreement.

9. _Termination_. This Agreement and the obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate upon the first to occur of (a) the Effective Time of the Merger or (b) the termination of 

 



A-1-4  the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (the "Termination Date");
_provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 9_ and  _Section_ __ _
11_ hereof shall survive any such termination.

10. _Specific Performance_. Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury will result to Parent in the event of a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and that Parent may have no adequate remedy at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material breach of this Agreement, and in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy Parent may have, Shareholder agrees that the entry of a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction (including, without limitation, specific performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the violation or breach thereof by Shareholder or any Affiliates, agents, or any other persons acting for or with Shareholder in any capacity whatsoever, is an appropriate remedy for any such breach and that Shareholder will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that Parent has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder further agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with Parents seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. Such injunctive and other equitable remedies are cumulative and Shareholder submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action.

the Shareholders heirs, executors, guardians, administrators, trustees or
successors, except to the extent enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and subject to the general

Shareholder, the Shareholder or, as applicable, the

 



A-1-5  Shareholders heirs, executors, guardians, administrators, trustees or
successors, shall remain liable for the performance of all obligations under
this Agreement.

Form of Parent Voting and Support Agreement _EXHIBIT A-2 _

 

PARENT VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

This PARENT VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of February 26, 2018 by and among Community Bank, a
California state-chartered bank ("Community"), the shareholder of CVB
Financial Corp., a California corporation ("Parent"), that is a signatory to
this Agreement (the "Shareholder"), and solely for purposes of _Sections 5_
and _9_ , Parent.

_Recitals_

 

A. Parent, Citizens Business Bank, a California state-chartered bank and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Citizens") and Community are concurrently
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger (and as it
may be amended, the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of the date of this
Agreement, pursuant to which Community will merge (the "Merger") with and
into Citizens, whereupon each issued and outstanding share of Communitys
common stock ("Community Common Stock") will be converted into the right to
receive the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement.

B. As a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Community has required that the Shareholder, solely in the Shareholders
capacity as a shareholder and beneficial owner or record holder of Parents
common stock ("Parent Common Stock"), enter into, and the Shareholder has
agreed to enter into, this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, for good and valuable
consideration, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 

1. _Representations and Warranties of the Shareholder_. The Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to Community as follows: 

(a) _Authority; No Violation_. The Shareholder has all necessary power
and authority to enter into and perform all of the Shareholders obligations
hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Shareholder (and the Shareholders spouse, if the Shares (as defined
below) constitute community property) and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Shareholder and such spouse, enforceable against the
Shareholder and the Shareholders spouse in accordance with its terms, except
to the extent enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and subject to the general principles of equity.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Shareholder
will not violate any other agreement to which the Shareholder is a party,
including any voting agreement, shareholders agreement, trust agreement or
voting trust.

 

(b) _Ownership of Shares_. As used in this Agreement, "Shares" means the
shares of Parent Common Stock which the Shareholder owns of record or
beneficially and has the power to vote, including the shares of Parent Common
Stock owned of record or beneficially, with power to vote, as of the date of
this Agreement, which are listed on Schedule I hereto (the

 



A-2-1  "Existing Shares") and the shares of Parent Common Stock acquired by the
Shareholder, with power to vote, after the date of this Agreement. The
Existing Shares are owned by the Shareholder, subject to applicable community
property laws, free and clear of all encumbrances, voting arrangements and
commitments of every kind, except as would not restrict the performance of the
Shareholders obligations under this Agreement. The Shareholder represents
and warrants that the Shareholder has sole or shared power to vote all
Existing Shares.

 

2. _Voting Agreement and Agreement Not to Transfer_. 

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Termination Date (as defined
in _Section_ __ _ 7_ below) (the "Support Period"), the Shareholder hereby
agrees that, at any meeting of Parents shareholders (and at any adjournment
or postponement thereof), however called, and in any action taken by written
consent of Parents shareholders in lieu of a meeting, the Shareholder will
vote or cause to be voted all Shares held by the Shareholder as of the
applicable voting record date:

 

(i) in favor of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the "Parent Share Issuance") and any other
matter that is required to be approved by Parents shareholders to facilitate
the Merger;

 

(ii) against any action or agreement that to the knowledge of the
Shareholder would result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Parent
under this Agreement or the Merger Agreement; and

 

(iii) except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by the Merger Agreement
or otherwise consented to by Community, against any matter, to the extent
that such matter requires a Parent shareholder vote, that to the knowledge of
the Shareholder could be reasonably expected to materially impede, interfere
with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Parent Share
Issuance or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

During the Support Period, the Shareholder shall not enter into any agreement
or understanding with any Person or entity to vote or give instructions after
the Termination Date in any manner inconsistent with _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ ,
or  _(iii)_ of the preceding sentence.

(b) Except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by the Merger Agreement
or otherwise consented to by Community, during the Support Period, the
Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly (i) sell, give, transfer,
exchange, pledge, assign, hypothecate, encumber, tender or otherwise dispose
of or encumber or make any offer or agreement relating to any of the
foregoing with respect to the Shares (collectively, a "Transfer"), (ii)
enforce or permit execution of the provisions of any redemption, share
purchase or sale, recapitalization or other agreement with Parent or any
other Person or enter into any contract, option or other agreement,
arrangement or understanding with respect to the Transfer of, directly or
indirectly, any of the Shares or any securities convertible into
or exercisable for Shares, any other capital stock of Parent or any interest
in any of the foregoing with any Person, (iii) except as set forth herein,
deposit any Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or
arrangement with 

 



A-2-2  respect to such Shares or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect
thereto, (iv) enter into any swap, contract, option or other arrangement or
undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect sale, assignment,
transfer, exchange or other disposition of or transfer of any interest in or
the voting of any Shares, (v) take any action that would make any of the
Shareholders representations or warranties contained in this Agreement
untrue or incorrect in any material respect or have the effect of preventing
or disabling the Shareholder from performing the Shareholders obligations
under this Agreement; _provided_ _however_ , that this Agreement shall not
prohibit the Shareholder from (x) disposing of or surrendering to Parent
shares underlying any equity award by Parent in connection with the vesting of
such equity award for the payment of taxes thereon, if any, or (y)
transferring and delivering Shares to any member of Shareholders immediate
family or to a trust for the benefit of Shareholder or upon the death of
Shareholder; _provided_ that such a Transfer shall only be permitted if, as
a precondition to such Transfer, the transferee agrees in writing, to be
bound by and comply with the provisions of this Agreement. Once Parent
Shareholder Approval has been obtained, the prohibitions provided for in
_Section_ _ 2(b)_ shall no longer apply to Shareholder.

3. _Notice of Share Acquisitions_. Shareholder hereby agrees to notify Community promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) in writing if at any time during the term of this Agreement Shareholder acquires beneficial or record ownership, individually or in the aggregate, of more than 100,000 shares of Parent Common Stock or other securities of Parent. 

4. _Shareholder Capacity_. The Shareholder is entering this Agreement in Shareholders capacity as the record or beneficial owner of the Shareholders Shares, and not in the Shareholders as a director of Parent or, as applicable, a trustee of any Parent benefit plan. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall be deemed in any manner to limit or affect in any manner the discretion of the Shareholder to take any action, or fail to take any action, in the Shareholders capacity as a director of Parent or, as applicable, as a trustee of any benefit plan of Parent, that the Shareholder determines the Shareholder should take (or fail to take) in the exercise of the Shareholders duties and responsibilities as a director of Parent or, as applicable, as a trustee of any benefit plan of Parent. 

5. _Stop Transfer Order_. In furtherance of this Agreement, the Shareholder hereby authorizes and instructs Parent to enter a stop transfer order with respect to all of the Shareholders Shares for the Support Period, except for such Transfers as are as otherwise provided for or permitted by this Agreement. Parent agrees that it shall comply with such stop transfer instructions. 

6. _Ownership Rights_. Community acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Community any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Shareholder, and Community shall have no authority to exercise any power or authority to direct the Shareholder in the voting of any of the Shares, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. 

7. _Termination_. This Agreement and the obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate upon the first to occur of (a) the Effective Time of the Merger or (b) the termination of 

 



A-2-3  the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (the "Termination Date");
_provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 7_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9_
hereof shall survive any such termination.

8. _Specific Performance_. Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury will result to Community in the event of a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and that Community may have no adequate remedy at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material breach of this Agreement, and in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy Community may have, Shareholder agrees that the entry of a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction (including, without limitation, specific performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the violation or breach thereof by Shareholder or any Affiliates, agents, or any other persons acting for or with Shareholder in any capacity whatsoever, is an appropriate remedy for any such breach and that Shareholder will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that Community has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder further agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with Communitys seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. Such injunctive and other equitable remedies are cumulative and Shareholder submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action.

NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

This NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this
"Agreement") dated as of February 26, 2018 is entered into by and between
Citizens Business Bank, a California state-chartered bank ("Citizens"), and
[_______] ("Director").

RECITALS

 

A. Citizens, CVB Financial Corp., a California corporation and parent
corporation of Citizens ("Parent"), and Community Bank, a California state-
chartered bank ("Community"), have entered into that certain Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization and Merger, dated as of February 26, 2018 (the "Merger
Agreement"), which, among other things, contemplates the merger of Community
into Citizens (the "Merger"). By operation of the Merger, Citizens will
succeed, without further transfer, to the rights, obligations, properties and
assets of Community, including all goodwill, trade secrets and other
intellectual property of Community, at the Effective Time of the Merger.

 

B. Director is a director of Community and beneficial owner of Community
common stock. Director holds restricted stock units of Community ("RSUs")
that will be converted into shares of Community common stock immediately prior
to the Merger as provided in the Community equity plan, the RSU grant
agreement and the Merger Agreement, and Director will then be eligible to
receive the Merger Consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement. Therefore,
Director is entitled to receive substantial monetary payments in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement pursuant
to Directors being the holder of a certain number of RSUs.

C. As a condition and an inducement to Parents and Citizens willingness
to enter into the Merger Agreement, and in order to protect the goodwill,
trade secrets and other intellectual property of Community from after the
Effective Time of the Merger, Director agrees to refrain from competing with
and using trade secrets or soliciting customers or employees of Community and,
from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Citizens as successor to
Community, in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

D. Director and Citizens intend for the provisions of this Agreement to be
in compliance with California Business and Professions Code Section 16601 and
further intend for it to be fully enforceable.

E. Except as otherwise provided herein, each capitalized term shall have
the meaning given to such term in the Merger Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth:

 



 



B1-1 "Customer" means any Person with whom Community has an existing
relationship for Financial Services (as defined below) from the date of
execution of the Merger Agreement until immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger.

contained herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, Director and Citizens agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY DIRECTOR_

Director acknowledges that:

 

(a) Parent and Citizens would not enter into the Merger Agreement unless
Director agrees not to enter into an activity that is competitive with or
similar to the Enterprise in violation of this Agreement and that,
accordingly, this Agreement is a material inducement for Parent and Citizens
to enter into and to carry out the terms of the Merger
Agreement. Accordingly, Director expressly acknowledges that [he/she] is

Secrets in violation of the terms of this Agreement, or if Director were to
solicit employees of Community or Citizens as successor to Community from and
after the Effective Time of the Merger in violation of the terms of
this Agreement. Accordingly, Director expressly acknowledges that [he/she] is
voluntarily entering into this Agreement and that the terms and conditions of
this Agreement are fair and reasonable to Director in all respects.

any interest in the ownership, management, operation, or control of, or be

Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Ventura, California.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Director
shall not be deemed to be in contravention of subsection _(a)_ of this

solely (A) as an officer or director of Parent or Citizens or (B) as a passive
investor in up to 5% of the equity securities or 10% of the debt securities
of a

 



B1-3  company or partnership, or (z) Director is employed by a business or
enterprise that is engaged primarily in a business other than the provision of
Financial Services which is competitive with or similar to the Enterprise and
Director does not apply in any manner [his/her] expertise at such business or
enterprise to that part of such business or enterprise that is competitive
with or similar to the Enterprise.

 

2.2 _Non-solicitation_. During the Applicable Period, Director shall
not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Parent or
Citizens, on behalf of any Financial Institution,

 

(a) solicit or aid in the solicitation of any Customers or Prospective

(b) solicit or aid in the solicitation of any officers or employees of
Community or, from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Citizens as

applicable, in each case, to terminate such persons relationships with the
Surviving Corporation.

The prohibitions set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ shall not apply to
general solicitations or attempted solicitations by employment agencies (so
long as the agency was not directed to solicit a Person otherwise subject to
the prohibitions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_) or the general advertising or
general solicitations not specifically directed at such Person(s).

 

2.3 _Trade Secrets_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
at all times after the date hereof, other than for the benefit of Community,
or as otherwise approved by Community, and, after the Effective Time of the
Merger (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), other than for the
benefit of Parent and/or Citizens or as otherwise approved by Parent or
Citizens in writing, Director (i) shall make no use of the Trade Secrets, or
any part thereof; (ii) shall not disclose the Trade Secrets, or any part
thereof, to any other Person, and (iii) shall deliver, on and after the
Effective Time of the Merger, upon the request of Citizens, all documents,
reports, drawings, designs, plans, proposals and other tangible evidence of
Trade Secrets, now possessed or hereafter acquired by Director, to Parent
and/or Citizens. 

2.4 _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Director may disclose or reveal any information, whether including
in whole or in part any Trade Secrets, that Director is required to disclose
or reveal under any applicable Law or is otherwise required to disclose or
reveal by any Governmental Authority; provided, that Director makes a good
faith request that the confidentiality of the Trade Secrets be preserved and,
to the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws, gives Citizens prompt notice
of such requirement in advance of such disclosure and exercises reasonable
efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such Trade Secrets, including,
without limitation, by reasonably cooperating with Parent and Citizens, to
obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such Trade Secrets by the
Governmental Authority or other recipient of the Trade Secrets.



 



B1-4 ARTICLE III

 

 _INDEPENDENCE OF OBLIGATIONS_

 

The covenants of Director set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as
independent of any other agreement or arrangement between Director, on the
one hand, and Citizens on the other, and the existence of any claim or cause
of action by Director against Community, Citizens, Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates (or the existence of any claim or cause of action
by Citizens or Parent against Director, as the case may be), shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement of such covenants against Director, or
against Citizens or Parent, as the case may be.

 

ARTICLE IV

_GENERAL_

 

4.1 _Amendments_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, this Agreement
may be amended by agreement in writing of the parties hereto at any time.

4.2 _Integration_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings of the parties in connection
therewith.

 

4.3 _Termination._

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action in
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger.

(b) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to subsection  _(a)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 4.3_, the obligations of Director under _Section_ __ _ 2.1_
shall terminate at the end of the Applicable Period.

 

(c) Unless sooner terminated under subsection _(a)_ of this _Section_ __ _
4.3_, and except as provided in subsection _(b)_ of this _Section_ __ _
4.3_, the obligations of Director under this Agreement shall terminate only on
the mutual agreement of Director, on the one hand, and Citizens or the
Surviving Corporation, on the other hand.

4.4 _Specific Performance_. Director acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable injury will result to Citizens in the event of a breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement and that Citizens may have no adequate remedy
at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material breach of
this Agreement, and in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy
Citizens may have, Director agrees that the entry of a preliminary injunction
and a permanent injunction (including, without limitation, specific
performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the violation
or breach thereof by Director or any Affiliates, agents, or any other persons
acting for or with Director in any capacity whatsoever, is an appropriate
remedy for any such breach and that Director will not oppose the granting of
such relief on the basis that Citizens has an adequate remedy at law. Director
submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action. In addition,
after discussing the matter with Director, Citizens shall have the right to
inform any third party that Citizens reasonably believes to be, or to be

 



B1-5  contemplating, participating with Director or receiving from Director
assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and
the rights of Citizens hereunder, and that participation by any such persons
with Director in activities in violation of Directors agreement with Citizens
set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by Citizens against such
third party in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at
law or in equity.

4.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable as to duration, activity or
subject, it shall be deemed to extend only over the maximum duration, range of
activities or subjects as to which such provision shall be valid and
enforceable under applicable Law. If any provisions shall, for any reason, be
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be
construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein.

 

4.6 _Notices_. Any notice or communication required or permitted
hereunder, shall be deemed to have been given if in writing and (a) delivered
in person, (b) delivered by confirmed email transmission, (c) sent by

provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver thereof. The waiver
by Citizens of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Director shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or violation
thereof. All waivers shall be in writing and signed by the party to be bound.

4.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement may be assignable by Citizens only in
connection with a sale of all or substantially all of its assets or a merger
or reorganization in which it is not the surviving corporation. Any attempted

(Community Independent Directors) _EXHIBIT B-2_

 

NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

This NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this
"Agreement") dated as of February 26, 2018 is entered into by and between
Citizens Business Bank, a California state-chartered bank ("Citizens"), and
[_______] ("Director").

RECITALS

 

A. Citizens, CVB Financial Corp., a California corporation and parent
corporation of Citizens ("Parent"), and Community Bank, a California state-
chartered bank ("Community"), have entered into that certain Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization and Merger, dated as of February 26, 2018 (the "Merger
Agreement"), which, among other things, contemplates the merger of Community
into Citizens (the "Merger"). By operation of the Merger, Citizens will

B. Director is an independent director of Community and beneficial owner of
Community common stock. Director holds restricted stock units of Community
("RSUs") that will be converted into shares of Community common stock
immediately prior to the Merger as provided in the Community equity plan, the
RSU grant agreement and the Merger Agreement, and Director will then be
eligible to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in the Merger
Agreement. Therefore, Director is entitled to receive substantial monetary
payments in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement pursuant to Directors being the holder of a certain number
of RSUs.

C. As a condition and an inducement to Parents and Citizens willingness
to enter into the Merger Agreement, and in order to protect the goodwill,
trade secrets and other intellectual property of Community from after the
Effective Time of the Merger, Director agrees to refrain from competing with
and using trade secrets or soliciting customers or employees of Community and,
from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Citizens as successor to
Community, in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

D. Director and Citizens intend for the provisions of this Agreement to be
in compliance with California Business and Professions Code Section 16601 and
further intend for it to be fully enforceable.

the meaning given to such term in the Merger Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth:

between the date of execution of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time

_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY DIRECTOR_

Director acknowledges that:

 

(a) Parent and Citizens would not enter into the Merger Agreement unless
Director agrees not to enter into an activity that is competitive with or
similar to the Enterprise in violation of this Agreement and that,
accordingly, this Agreement is a material inducement for Parent and Citizens
to enter into and to carry out the terms of the Merger
Agreement. Accordingly, Director expressly acknowledges that [he/she] is

enter into and carry out the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 

(b) By virtue of [his/her] position with Community, Director has developed

Secrets in violation of the terms of this Agreement, or if Director were to

after the Effective Time of the Merger in violation of the terms of

investor in up to 5% of the equity securities or 10% of the debt securities
of a company or partnership, or (z) Director is employed by a business or
enterprise that is engaged primarily in a business other than the provision of

enterprise to that part of such business or enterprise that is competitive
with or similar to the Enterprise.

 

2.2 _Non-solicitation_. During the Applicable Period, Director shall
not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Parent or

Surviving Corporation.

The prohibitions set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ shall not apply to
general solicitations or attempted solicitations by employment agencies (so
long as the agency was not directed to solicit a Person otherwise subject to
the prohibitions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_) or the general advertising or
general solicitations not specifically directed at such Person(s).

 

2.3 _Trade Secrets_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
at all times after the date hereof, other than for the benefit of Community,
or as otherwise approved by Community, and, after the Effective Time of the
Merger (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), other than for the
benefit of Parent and/or Citizens or as otherwise approved by Parent or
Citizens in writing, Director (i) shall make no use of the Trade Secrets, or
any part thereof; (ii) shall not disclose the Trade Secrets, or any part

contrary, Director may disclose or reveal any information, whether including

reveal by any Governmental Authority; provided, that Director makes a

 



B2-4  good faith request that the confidentiality of the Trade Secrets be
preserved and, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws, gives Citizens
prompt notice of such requirement in advance of such disclosure and exercises
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such Trade Secrets,
including, without limitation, by reasonably cooperating with Parent and
Citizens, to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Trade
Secrets by the Governmental Authority or other recipient of the Trade Secrets.

 

ARTICLE III

_INDEPENDENCE OF OBLIGATIONS_

The covenants of Director set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as
independent of any other agreement or arrangement between Director, on the
one hand, and Citizens on the other, and the existence of any claim or cause
of action by Director against Community, Citizens, Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates (or the existence of any claim or cause of action by
Citizens or Parent against Director, as the case may be), shall not constitute
a defense to the enforcement of such covenants against Director, or against
Citizens or Parent, as the case may be.

 

ARTICLE IV

_GENERAL_

 

4.1 _Amendments_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, this Agreement
may be amended by agreement in writing of the parties hereto at any time.

4.2 _Integration_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings of the parties in connection
therewith.

 

4.3 _Termination._

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action in
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger.

(b) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to subsection  _(a)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 4.3_, the obligations of Director under _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(i)_ shall terminate at the end of the Applicable Period and the
obligations of Director under  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_ shall terminate
six months after the Effective Time of the Merger..

 

(c) Unless sooner terminated under subsection _(a)_ of this _Section_ __ _
4.3_, and except as provided in subsection _(b)_ of this _Section_ __ _
4.3_, the obligations of Director under this Agreement shall terminate only on
the mutual agreement of Director, on the one hand, and Citizens or the
Surviving Corporation, on the other hand.

4.4 _Specific Performance_. Director acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable injury will result to Citizens in the event of a breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement and that

 



B2-5  Citizens may have no adequate remedy at law with respect thereto.
Accordingly, in the event of a material breach of this Agreement, and in
addition to any other legal or equitable remedy Citizens may have, Director
agrees that the entry of a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction
(including, without limitation, specific performance) by a court of competent
jurisdiction, to restrain the violation or breach thereof by Director or any
Affiliates, agents, or any other persons acting for or with Director in any
capacity whatsoever, is an appropriate remedy for any such breach and that
Director will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that
Citizens has an adequate remedy at law. Director submits to the jurisdiction
of such court in any such action. In addition, after discussing the matter
with Director, Citizens shall have the right to inform any third party that
Citizens reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating
with Director or receiving from Director assistance in violation of this
Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and the rights of Citizens
hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Director in
activities in violation of Directors agreement with Citizens set forth in
this Agreement may give rise to claims by Citizens against such third party in
addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in
equity.

 

4.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable as to duration, activity
or subject, it shall be deemed to extend only over the maximum duration, range
of activities or subjects as to which such provision shall be valid and
enforceable under applicable Law. If any provisions shall, for any reason, be
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be
construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein.

4.6 _Notices_. Any notice or communication required or permitted
hereunder, shall be deemed to have been given if in writing and (a) delivered
in person, (b) delivered by confirmed email transmission, (c) sent by
overnight carrier, postage prepaid with return receipt requested or (d)
mailed by certified or registered mail postage prepaid with return receipt

and between Citizens Business Bank, a California state-chartered bank
("Citizens"), and David R. Misch ("Shareholder").

 

RECITALS

 

A. Citizens, CVB Financial Corp., a California corporation and parent
corporation of Citizens ("Parent"), and Community Bank, a California state-
chartered bank ("Community"), have entered into that certain Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization and Merger, dated as of February 26, 2018 (the "Merger
Agreement"), which, among other things, contemplates the merger of Community
into Citizens (the "Merger"). By operation of the Merger, Citizens will
succeed, without further transfer, to the rights, obligations, properties and
assets of Community, including all goodwill, trade secrets and other
intellectual property of Community, at the Effective Time of the Merger.

 

B. Shareholder is a beneficial owner of Community common stock and an
executive officer of Community. Shareholder holds restricted stock units of
Community ("RSUs") that will be converted into shares of Community common
stock immediately prior to the Merger as provided in the Community equity
plan, the RSU grant agreement and the Merger Agreement, and Shareholder will
then be eligible to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

 

C. Shareholder is entitled to receive substantial monetary payments in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as a
shareholder of Community and pursuant to Shareholders change in
control/severance agreement by and between Shareholder and Community.

 

D. As a condition and an inducement to Parents and Citizens willingness
to enter into the Merger Agreement, and in order to protect the goodwill,
trade secrets and other intellectual property of Community from after the
Effective Time of the Merger, Shareholder agrees to refrain from competing
with and using trade secrets or soliciting customers or employees of
Community and, from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Citizens as
successor to Community, in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

E. Shareholder and Citizens intend for the provisions of this Agreement to
be in compliance with California Business and Professions Code Section 16601
and further intend for it to be fully enforceable.



 



B3-1 F. Except as otherwise provided herein, each capitalized term shall
have the meaning given to such term in the Merger Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth:

 

"Customer" means any Person (i) with whom Community has an existing
relationship for Financial Services (as defined below) from the date of
execution of the Merger Agreement until immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, or (ii) who is a customer of Citizens immediately prior to
termination of Shareholders employment or other position with Citizens, if
applicable.

"Enterprise" means the provision of Financial Services conducted by Community
at any time from the date of execution of the Merger Agreement until
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.

"Financial Institution" means a "depository institution" as that term is
defined in 12 C.F.R. Section 348.2, and any parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof.

 

"Financial Services" means any banking, financial or other services provided

Shareholders knowledge, specifically pursued a relationship in writing
(including through e-mail correspondence) to provide Financial Services at any
time between the date of execution of the Merger Agreement and the Effective
Time of the Merger or (ii) with whom Citizens has, to Shareholders
knowledge, specifically pursued a relationship in writing (including through
e-mail correspondence) to provide Financial Services at any time prior
to termination of Shareholders employment or other position with Citizens,
if applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that Communitys or Citizens general
solicitation for business, such as through television or media
advertising, does not constitute pursuit of a relationship.

knowledge, know-how, techniques, secret processes, improvements, discoveries,
methods, inventions, sales, financial information, Customers, lists of
Customers and Prospective Customers, broker lists, potential brokers, rate

or may hereafter acquire, knowledge and possession as a shareholder, director,
officer or employee of Community or, if applicable, Parent or Citizens, or as
a result of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; _provided_
_however_ , notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the

 



B3-2  contrary, "Trade Secrets" shall not include any (i) information which is or
has become available from a third party who learned the information
independently and is not or was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with
respect to such information; or (ii) information readily ascertainable from
public, trade or other nonconfidential sources (other than as a result,
directly or indirectly, of a disclosure or other dissemination in
contravention of a confidentiality agreement).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
respective representations, warranties and covenants, agreements and
conditions contained herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Shareholder and Citizens agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY SHAREHOLDER_

Shareholder acknowledges that:

 

(a) Parent and Citizens would not enter into the Merger Agreement unless
Shareholder agrees not to enter into an activity that is competitive with or
similar to the Enterprise in violation of this Agreement and that,
accordingly, this Agreement is a material inducement for Parent and Citizens
to enter into and to carry out the terms of the Merger
Agreement. Accordingly, Shareholder expressly acknowledges that he is
entering into this Agreement with Citizens to induce Parent and Citizens to
enter into and carry out the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 

(b) By virtue of his position with Community and, if applicable, Parent
and/or Citizens after the Effective Time of the Merger, Shareholder has
developed considerable expertise in the business operations of Community and,
if applicable, will develop considerable expertise in the business operations
of Parent and Citizens and has access to Trade Secrets of Community and, if
applicable, will have access to Trade Secrets of Parent and Citizens.
Shareholder recognizes that Parent and Citizens would be irreparably damaged,
and its substantial investment in Community materially impaired, if
Shareholder were to enter into an activity that is competitive with or
similar to the Enterprise in violation of the terms of this Agreement, if
Shareholder were to disclose or make use of any Trade Secrets in violation of
the terms of this Agreement, or if Shareholder were to solicit Customers,
Prospective Customers or employees of Community or Citizens as successor to
Community from and after the Effective Time of the Merger in violation of the
terms of this Agreement. Accordingly, Shareholder expressly acknowledges that
he is voluntarily entering into this Agreement and that the terms and
conditions of this Agreement are fair and reasonable to Shareholder in all
respects.

 

ARTICLE II

_NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE_

 

2.1 _Non-competition._

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement and for the period ending on the
expiration of twenty-four (24) months after the Effective Time of the Merger
(the "Applicable

 



B3-3  Period"), Shareholder shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior
written consent of Citizens, own, manage, operate, control, or have any
interest in the ownership, management, operation, or control of, or be
connected as a shareholder, member, partner, principal, director, officer,
manager, investor, organizer, founder, trustee, employee, advisor, consultant,
agent, or representative of or with, any business or enterprise engaged in
providing Financial Services in any of the following counties: Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Ventura, California.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Shareholder
shall not be deemed to be in contravention of subsection _(a)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_, if: (y) Shareholder participates in any such business
solely (A) as an officer or director of Parent or Citizens or (B) as a passive
investor in up to 5% of the equity securities or 10% of the debt securities
of a company or partnership, or (z) Shareholder is employed by a business or
enterprise that is engaged primarily in a business other than the provision of
Financial Services which is competitive with or similar to the Enterprise and
Shareholder does not apply in any manner his expertise at such business or
enterprise to that part of such business or enterprise that is competitive
with or similar to the Enterprise.

 

2.2 _Non-solicitation_. During the Applicable Period, Shareholder
shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of
Parent or Citizens, on behalf of any Financial Institution,

 

(a) solicit or aid in the solicitation of any Customers or Prospective
Customers for Financial Services,

 

(b) solicit or aid in the solicitation of any officers or employees of
Community or, from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Citizens as
successor to Community, or

(c) induce or attempt to induce immediately any Person who is a Customer
or a Prospective Customer, supplier, distributor, officer or employee of (i)
Community as of the date hereof or immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger or (ii) Citizens immediately prior to termination of Shareholders
employment or other position with Citizens, as applicable, in each case, to
terminate such persons relationships with the Surviving Corporation.

 

The prohibitions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ shall not apply to
general solicitations or attempted solicitations by employment agencies (so
long as the agency was not directed to solicit a Person otherwise subject to
the prohibitions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_) or the general advertising or
general solicitations not specifically directed at such Person(s).

2.3 _Trade Secrets_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
at all times after the date hereof, other than for the benefit of Community,
or as otherwise approved by Community, and, after the Effective Time of the
Merger (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), other than for the
benefit of Parent and/or Citizens or as otherwise approved by Parent or
Citizens in writing, Shareholder (i) shall make no use of the Trade Secrets,
or any part thereof; (ii) shall not disclose the Trade Secrets, or any part
thereof, to any other Person, and (iii) shall deliver, on and after the
Effective Time of the Merger, upon the request of Citizens, all documents,
reports, drawings, designs, plans, proposals and other tangible evidence of
Trade Secrets, now possessed or hereafter acquired by Shareholder, to Parent
and/or Citizens.



 



B3-4 2.4 _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Shareholder may disclose or reveal any information, whether
including in whole or in part any Trade Secrets, that Shareholder is required
to disclose or reveal under any applicable Law or is otherwise required to
disclose or reveal by any Governmental Authority; provided, that Shareholder
makes a good faith request that the confidentiality of the Trade Secrets be
preserved and, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws, gives Citizens
prompt notice of such requirement in advance of such disclosure and exercises
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such Trade Secrets,
including, without limitation, by reasonably cooperating with Parent and
Citizens, to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Trade Secrets
by the Governmental Authority or other recipient of the Trade Secrets.

 

ARTICLE III

RELEASE

 

3.1 _Release_. From and after the Effective Time of the Merger,
Shareholder on Shareholders own behalf and on behalf of Shareholders past,
present and future affiliates, agents, attorneys, administrators, heirs,
executors, spouses, trustees, beneficiaries, representatives, successors and
assigns claiming by or through Shareholder (collectively, the "Related
Persons"), hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably RELEASES and
FOREVER DISCHARGES (the "Release") Community and its current or former
affiliates, subsidiaries, subdivisions, officers, directors, employees,
managers, partners, principals, advisors, agents, stockholders, members,
investors, equity holders or other representatives (including attorneys,
accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors), successors
(including Citizens), predecessors or assigns (each, a "Released Party" and
collectively, the "Released Parties") from the following (collectively, the
"Releasing Party Claims"): any and all claims, demands,
allegations, assertions, complaints, controversies, charges, duties
(fiduciary or otherwise), breaches of duties, grievances, rights, causes of
action, actions, suits, liabilities, debts, obligations, promises,
commitments, agreements, guarantees, endorsements, duties, damages, costs,
losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs incurred) of
any nature whatsoever (whether direct or indirect, known or unknown, disclosed
or undisclosed, matured or unmatured, accrued or unaccrued, asserted or
unasserted, absolute or contingent, determined or conditional, express or
implied, fixed or variable and whether vicarious, derivative, joint, several
or secondary) relating to the Released Parties, including, without limitation,
any and all actions, activities, assets, liabilities and the ownership of any
securities, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, absolute or
contingent, direct or indirect or nominally or beneficially possessed or
claimed by Shareholder, whether the same be in administrative proceedings, in
arbitration, at law, in equity or mixed, which Shareholder ever had, now has
or hereafter may have against any or all of the Released Parties, in respect
of any and all agreements, liabilities or obligations entered into or
incurred on or prior to the date hereof, or in respect of any event occurring
or circumstances existing on or prior to the date

 

hereof, whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the
date hereof; provided, however, that the foregoing release does not extend
to, include or restrict or limit in any way, and each Releasing Party hereby
reserves such Releasing Partys rights, if any, and the right of the other
Releasing Parties, if any, to pursue any and all Releasing Party Claims that
such Releasing Party may now or in the future have solely on account of (a)
any existing rights of such Releasing Party under any severance agreement,
employment agreement or other employee

 



B3-5  benefit plan of Community of which Shareholder is a party or is otherwise a
beneficiary thereof, (b) any rights or claims for benefits (other than any
severance or deferred compensation) under benefit plans of Community (or its
successor) (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, COBRA
benefits and rights to account balances, earnings thereon and forfeiture
allocations), (c) rights under any applicable workers compensation statutes
arising out of compensable job related injuries, (d) any claims relating to
salary, vacation pay or other compensation received in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (e) any rights to indemnification for
serving as an officer, director, agent or employee of Community or any
affiliates of Community, or serving at the request of Community as a trustee
or fiduciary of any benefit plan, provided that such rights exist as a matter
of law or contract or pursuant to the corporate documents of such applicable
company, (f) any rights under the Merger Agreement to the Merger Consideration
and (g) any claim which, as a matter of applicable Law, cannot be released.

 

3.2 _ADEA_. Without limiting the scope of the Release in any way,
Shareholder certifies that the Release constitutes a knowing and voluntary
waiver of any and all rights or claims that exist or that he/she may have or
may claim to have under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act
("ADEA"), as amended by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990,
which is set forth at 29 U.S.C. § § 621, et seq. The Release does not govern
any rights or claims that may arise under the ADEA after the date the Release
is signed by Shareholder. If Shareholder is age 40 or over, (a) he/she is
aware of his/her right to revoke the Release at any time within the seven
(7)-day period following the date he/she signs it and that the Release shall
not become effective or enforceable until the seven (7)-day revocation period
expires without revocation; and (b) he/she has been given an opportunity to
consider fully the terms of the Release for forty-five (45) days, although
Shareholder is not required to wait forty-five (45) days before signing the
Release. Shareholder understands that he or she will relinquish any right to
any retention bonuses set forth in the Community retention bonus plan if
he/she exercises his/her right to revoke it.

3.3 _No Additional Facts_. Shareholder agree that because the
Release specifically covers known and unknown claims, Shareholder waives any
and all rights under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, or under any
comparable law of any other jurisdiction. Section 1542 states:

 

"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release,
which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her
settlement with the debtor."

Shareholder hereby expressly waives any rights Shareholder may have under
Section 1542 of the California Civil Code or any other applicable law to
preserve Releasing Party Claims which Shareholder does not know or suspect to
exist in Shareholders favor at the time of executing the release provided in
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_. Shareholder understands and acknowledges that
Shareholder may discover facts different from, or in addition to, those which
Shareholder knows or believes to be true with respect to the claims released
herein, and agrees that the release provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ shall be
and remain effective in all respects notwithstanding any subsequent discovery
of different or additional facts. If Shareholder discovers that any fact
relied upon in entering into the release provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ was
untrue, or that any fact was concealed, or

 



B3-6  that an understanding of the facts or law was incorrect, Shareholder shall
not be entitled to any relief as a result thereof, and Shareholder surrenders
any rights Shareholder might have to rescind the release provided in
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_ on any ground. Such release is intended to be and is
final and binding regardless of any claim of misrepresentation, promise made
with the intention of performing, concealment of fact, mistake of law, or any
other circumstances whatsoever.

3.4 _No Suits or Actions_. Shareholder hereby irrevocably covenants to
refrain from, and shall cause each of its Related Persons to refrain from,
asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be
commenced, any suit, proceeding or manner of action of any kind against any
Released Party based upon any Releasing Party Claim. If Shareholder (or any of
its Related Persons) does any of the things mentioned in the immediately
preceding sentence, then Shareholder shall indemnify the Released Parties (or
any of them) in the amount of the value of any final judgment or settlement
(monetary or other) and any related cost (including reasonable legal fees)
entered against, paid or incurred by the Released Parties (or any of them).

 

3.5 _Revocation_. Shareholder acknowledges that Shareholder (a) has read
the Release, (b) has been provided a full and ample opportunity to study it,
including a period of at least forty-five (45) days if Shareholder is over
forty (40) years old (or, if less than forty (40) years old, at least ten (10)
days) within which to consider it (although Shareholder may voluntarily
choose to execute the Release earlier), and (c) is signing it voluntarily with
full knowledge that it is intended, to the maximum extent permitted by law, as
a complete release and waiver of any and all claims, including without
limitation any claims under ADEA. To revoke, Shareholder must send a written
notice of revocation to Citizens at the address set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.6_ of this Agreement.

 

3.6 _No Assignment of Releasing Party Claims_. Shareholder represents and
warrants to the Released Parties that there has been no assignment or other
transfer of any interest in any Releasing Party Claim.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _INDEPENDENCE OF OBLIGATIONS_

 

The covenants of Shareholder set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as
independent of any other agreement or arrangement between Shareholder, on the
one hand, and Citizens on the other, and the existence of any claim or cause
of action by Shareholder against Community, Citizens, Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates (or the existence of any claim or cause of action
by Citizens or Parent against Shareholder, as the case may be), shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement of such covenants against Shareholder,
or against Citizens or Parent, as the case may be.

 



 



B3-7 ARTICLE V

 

 _GENERAL_

 

5.1 _Amendments_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, this Agreement
may be amended by agreement in writing of the parties hereto at any time.

5.2 _Integration_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings of the parties in connection
therewith.

 

5.3 _Termination._

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action in
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger.

(b) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to subsection  _(a)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the obligations of Shareholder under _Sections 2.1_ and
_2.2_ shall terminate at the end of the Applicable Period. The Release shall
continue to be in full force and effect indefinitely, unless this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 5.3(a).

(c) Unless sooner terminated under subsection _(a)_ of this _Section_ __
_ 5.3_, and except as provided in subsection _(b)_ of this _Section_ __ _
5.3_, the obligations of Shareholder under this Agreement shall
terminate only on the mutual agreement of Shareholder, on the one hand, and
Citizens or the Surviving Corporation, on the other hand.

 

5.4 _Specific Performance_. Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable injury will result to Citizens in the event of a breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement and that Citizens may have no adequate remedy
at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material breach of
this Agreement, and in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy
Citizens may have, Shareholder agrees that the entry of a preliminary
injunction and a permanent injunction (including, without limitation, specific
performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the violation
or breach thereof by Shareholder or any Affiliates, agents, or any other
persons acting for or with Shareholder in any capacity whatsoever, is an
appropriate remedy for any such breach and that Shareholder will not oppose
the granting of such relief on the basis that Citizens has an adequate remedy
at law. Shareholder submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such
action. In addition, after discussing the matter with Shareholder, Citizens
shall have the right to inform any third party that Citizens reasonably
believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Shareholder or
receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the
terms of this Agreement and the rights of Citizens hereunder, and
that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in activities in
violation of Shareholders agreement with Citizens set forth in this Agreement
may give rise to claims by Citizens against such third party in addition to
any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity.

5.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable as to duration, activity or
subject, it shall be deemed to extend only over the maximum duration, range of
activities or subjects as to which such 

 



B3-8  provision shall be valid and enforceable under applicable Law. If any
provisions shall, for any reason, be held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, but
this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained herein.

 

5.6 _Notices_. Any notice or communication required or permitted
hereunder, shall be deemed to have been given if in writing and (a) delivered
in person, (b) delivered by confirmed email transmission, (c) sent by
overnight carrier, postage prepaid with return receipt requested or (d) mailed
by certified or registered mail postage prepaid with return receipt
requested, addressed as follows:

requested.

 

5.7 _Waiver of Breach_. Any failure or delay by Citizens in enforcing any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver thereof. The waiver
by Citizens of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Shareholder
shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or
violation thereof. All waivers shall be in writing and signed by the party to
be bound.



 



B3-9 5.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement may be assignable by Citizens only in
connection with a sale of all or substantially all of its assets or a merger
or reorganization in which it is not the surviving corporation. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this prohibition shall be null and void.

 

5.9 _Binding Effect; Benefit to Successors_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon Shareholder and upon Shareholder s successor and
representatives and shall inure to the benefit of Citizens and its successors,
representatives and assigns.

 

5.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the legal relations between the
parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of California applicable to contracts between California parties made
and performed in this State.

assets of Community, including all goodwill, trade secrets and other
intellectual property of Community, at the Effective Time of the Merger.

 

B. Executive is a beneficial owner of Community common stock and an
executive officer of Community. Executive holds restricted stock units of
Community ("RSUs") that will be converted into shares of Community common
stock immediately prior to the Merger as provided in the Community equity
plan, the RSU grant agreement and the Merger Agreement, and Executive will
then be eligible to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

 

C. Executive is entitled to receive substantial monetary payments in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as an
Executive of Community and pursuant to Executives change in control/severance
agreement by and between Executive and Community.

 

D. As a condition and an inducement to Parents and Citizens willingness
to enter into the Merger Agreement, and in order to protect the goodwill,
trade secrets and other intellectual property of Community from after the
Effective Time of the Merger, Executive agrees to refrain from competing with
and using trade secrets or soliciting customers or employees of Community
and, from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Citizens as successor to
Community, in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

E. Executive and Citizens intend for the provisions of this Agreement to be
in compliance with California Business and Professions Code Section 16601 and
further intend for it to be fully enforceable.

has become available from a third party who learned the information
independently and is not or was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
respective representations, warranties and covenants, agreements and
conditions contained herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Executive and Citizens agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY EXECUTIVE_

Executive acknowledges that:

 

(a) Parent and Citizens would not enter into the Merger Agreement unless
Executive agrees not to enter into an activity that is competitive with or
similar to the Enterprise in violation of this Agreement and that,
accordingly, this Agreement is a material inducement for Parent and Citizens
to enter into and to carry out the terms of the Merger
Agreement. Accordingly, Executive expressly acknowledges that he is entering
into this Agreement with Citizens to induce Parent and Citizens to enter into
and carry out the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 

(b) By virtue of his position with Community and, if applicable, Parent
and/or Citizens after the Effective Time of the Merger, Executive has
developed considerable expertise in the business operations of Community and,
if applicable, will develop considerable expertise in the business operations
of Parent and Citizens and has access to Trade Secrets of Community and, if
applicable, will have access to Trade Secrets of Parent and Citizens.
Executive recognizes that Parent and Citizens would be irreparably damaged,
and its substantial investment in Community materially impaired, if Executive
were to enter into an activity that is competitive with or similar to the
Enterprise in violation of the terms of this Agreement, if Executive were to
disclose or make use of any Trade Secrets in violation of the terms of this
Agreement, or if Executive were to solicit Customers, Prospective Customers
or employees of Community or Citizens as successor to Community from and after
the Effective Time of the Merger in violation of the terms of this Agreement.
Accordingly, Executive expressly acknowledges that he is voluntarily entering
into this Agreement and that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are
fair and reasonable to Executive in all respects.

 

ARTICLE II

_NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE_

 

2.1 _Non-competition._

 

(a) In consideration of the substantial monetary payments to Executive upon
consummation of the Merger in exchange for Executives equity interest in
Community pursuant

 



B4-3  to the Merger Agreement, and payment by Citizens to Executive of $250,000 by
wire to an account designated by Executive on or prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger, Executive agrees that from the date of this Agreement and for
the period ending on the expiration of twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time of the Merger (the "Applicable Period"), Executive shall not, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Citizens, own, manage,
operate, control, or have any interest in the ownership, management,
operation, or control of, or be connected as a shareholder, member, partner,
principal, director, officer, manager, investor, organizer, founder, trustee,
employee, advisor, consultant, agent, or representative of or with, any
business or enterprise engaged in providing Financial Services in any of the
following counties: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego,
and Ventura, California.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Executive
shall not be deemed to be in contravention of subsection _(a)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_, if: (y) Executive participates in any such business
solely (A) as an officer or director of Parent or Citizens or (B) as a passive
investor in up to 5% of the equity securities or 10% of the debt securities
of a company or partnership, or (z) Executive is employed by a business or
enterprise that is engaged primarily in a business other than the provision of
Financial Services which is competitive with or similar to the Enterprise and
Executive does not apply in any manner his expertise at such business or
enterprise to that part of such business or enterprise that is competitive
with or similar to the Enterprise.

 

2.2 _Non-solicitation_. During the Applicable Period, Executive shall
not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Parent or
Citizens, on behalf of any Financial Institution,

 

(a) solicit or aid in the solicitation of any Customers or Prospective
Customers for Financial Services,

 

(b) solicit or aid in the solicitation of any officers or employees of
Community or, from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Citizens as
successor to Community, or

(c) induce or attempt to induce immediately any Person who is a Customer
or a Prospective Customer, supplier, distributor, officer or employee of (i)
Community as of the date hereof or immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger or (ii) Citizens immediately prior to termination of Executives
employment or other position with Citizens, as applicable, in each case, to
terminate such persons relationships with the Surviving Corporation.

 

The prohibitions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ shall not apply to
general solicitations or attempted solicitations by employment agencies (so
long as the agency was not directed to solicit a Person otherwise subject to
the prohibitions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_) or the general advertising or
general solicitations not specifically directed at such Person(s).

2.3 _Trade Secrets_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
at all times after the date hereof, other than for the benefit of Community,
or as otherwise approved by Community, and, after the Effective Time of the
Merger (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), other than for the
benefit of Parent and/or Citizens or as otherwise approved by Parent or
Citizens in writing, Executive (i) shall make no use of the Trade Secrets, or
any part thereof; (ii) shall not disclose the Trade Secrets, or any part
thereof, to any other Person, and 

 



B4-4  (iii) shall deliver, on and after the Effective Time of the Merger, upon the
request of Citizens, all documents, reports, drawings, designs, plans,
proposals and other tangible evidence of Trade Secrets, now possessed or
hereafter acquired by Executive, to Parent and/or Citizens.

2.4 _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Executive may disclose or reveal any information, whether including
in whole or in part any Trade Secrets, that Executive is required to disclose
or reveal under any applicable Law or is otherwise required to disclose or
reveal by any Governmental Authority; provided, that Executive makes a good
faith request that the confidentiality of the Trade Secrets be preserved and,
to the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws, gives Citizens prompt notice
of such requirement in advance of such disclosure and exercises reasonable
efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such Trade Secrets, including,
without limitation, by reasonably cooperating with Parent and Citizens,
to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such Trade Secrets by the
Governmental Authority or other recipient of the Trade Secrets.

 

ARTICLE III

RELEASE

 

3.1 _Release_. From and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Executive
on Executives own behalf and on behalf of Executives past, present and
future affiliates, agents, attorneys, administrators, heirs, executors,
spouses, trustees, beneficiaries, representatives, successors and assigns
claiming by or through Executive (collectively, the "Related Persons"),
hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably RELEASES and FOREVER
DISCHARGES (the "Release") Community and its current or former affiliates,
subsidiaries, subdivisions, officers, directors, employees, managers,
partners, principals, advisors, agents, stockholders, members, investors,
equity holders or other representatives (including attorneys, accountants,
consultants, bankers and financial advisors), successors (including
Citizens), predecessors or assigns (each, a "Released Party" and
collectively, the "Released Parties") from the following (collectively, the
"Releasing Party Claims"): any and all claims, demands,
allegations, assertions, complaints, controversies, charges, duties
(fiduciary or otherwise), breaches of duties, grievances, rights, causes of
action, actions, suits, liabilities, debts, obligations, promises,
commitments, agreements, guarantees, endorsements, duties, damages, costs,
losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs incurred) of
any nature whatsoever (whether direct or indirect, known or unknown, disclosed
or undisclosed, matured or unmatured, accrued or unaccrued, asserted or
unasserted, absolute or contingent, determined or conditional, express or
implied, fixed or variable and whether vicarious, derivative, joint, several
or secondary) relating to the Released Parties, including, without limitation,
any and all actions, activities, assets, liabilities and the ownership of any
securities, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, absolute or
contingent, direct or indirect or nominally or beneficially possessed or
claimed by Executive, whether the same be in administrative proceedings, in
arbitration, at law, in equity or mixed, which Executive ever had, now has or
hereafter may have against any or all of the Released Parties, in respect of
any and all agreements, liabilities or obligations entered into or incurred
on or prior to the date hereof, or in respect of any event occurring or
circumstances existing on or prior to the date hereof, whether or not relating
to claims pending on, or asserted after, the date hereof; provided, however,
that the foregoing release does not

 



B4-5  extend to, include or restrict or limit in any way, and each Releasing Party
hereby reserves such Releasing Partys rights, if any, and the right of the
other Releasing Parties, if any, to pursue any and all Releasing Party Claims
that such Releasing Party may now or in the future have solely on account of
(a) any existing rights of such Releasing Party under any severance agreement,
employment agreement or other employee benefit plan of Community of which
Executive is a party or is otherwise a beneficiary thereof, (b) any rights or
claims for benefits (other than any severance or deferred compensation) under
benefit plans of Community (or its successor) (including, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, COBRA benefits and rights to account
balances, earnings thereon and forfeiture allocations), (c) rights under any
applicable workers compensation statutes arising out of compensable job
related injuries, (d) any claims relating to salary, vacation pay or other
compensation received in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (e) any rights to indemnification for serving as an officer,
director, agent or employee of Community or any affiliates of Community, or
serving at the request of Community as a trustee or fiduciary of any benefit
plan, provided that such rights exist as a matter of law or contract or
pursuant to the corporate documents of such applicable company, (f) any
rights under the Merger Agreement to the Merger Consideration and (g) any
claim which, as a matter of applicable Law, cannot be released.

 

3.2 _ADEA_. Without limiting the scope of the Release in any way,
Executive certifies that the Release constitutes a knowing and voluntary
waiver of any and all rights or claims that exist or that he/she may have or
may claim to have under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act
("ADEA"), as amended by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990,
which is set forth at 29 U.S.C. § § 621, et seq. The Release does not govern
any rights or claims that may arise under the ADEA after the date the Release
is signed by Executive. If Executive is age 40 or over, (a) he/she is aware
of his/her right to revoke the Release at any time within the seven (7)-day
period following the date he/she signs it and that the Release shall not
become effective or enforceable until the seven (7)-day revocation period
expires without revocation; and (b) he/she has been given an opportunity to
consider fully the terms of the Release for forty-five (45) days, although
Executive is not required to wait forty-five (45) days before signing the
Release. Executive understands that he or she will relinquish any right to any
retention bonuses set forth in the Retention Bonus Agreement if he/she
exercises his/her right to revoke it.

3.3 _No Additional Facts_. Executive agree that because the Release
specifically covers known and unknown claims, Executive waives any and all
rights under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, or under any
comparable law of any other jurisdiction. Section 1542 states:

 

"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release,
which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her
settlement with the debtor."

Executive hereby expressly waives any rights Executive may have under Section
1542 of the California Civil Code or any other applicable law to preserve
Releasing Party Claims which Executive does not know or suspect to exist in
Executives favor at the time of executing the release provided in _Section_
__ _ 3.1_. Executive understands and acknowledges that Executive may discover
facts different from, or in addition to, those which Executive knows or
believes to be 

 



B4-6  true with respect to the claims released herein, and agrees that the release
provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ shall be and remain effective in all respects
notwithstanding any subsequent discovery of different or additional facts. If
Executive discovers that any fact relied upon in entering into the release
provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ was untrue, or that any fact was concealed,
or that an understanding of the facts or law was incorrect, Executive shall
not be entitled to any relief as a result thereof, and Executive surrenders
any rights Executive might have to rescind the release provided in _Section_
__ _ 3.1_ on any ground. Such release is intended to be and is final and
binding regardless of any claim of misrepresentation, promise made with the
intention of performing, concealment of fact, mistake of law, or any other
circumstances whatsoever.

 

3.4 _No Suits or Actions_. Executive hereby irrevocably covenants to
refrain from, and shall cause each of its Related Persons to refrain from,
asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be
commenced, any suit, proceeding or manner of action of any kind against any
Released Party based upon any Releasing Party Claim. If Executive (or any of
its Related Persons) does any of the things mentioned in the immediately
preceding sentence, then Executive shall indemnify the Released Parties (or
any of them) in the amount of the value of any final judgment or settlement
(monetary or other) and any related cost (including reasonable legal fees)
entered against, paid or incurred by the Released Parties (or any of them).

 

3.5 _Revocation_. Executive acknowledges that Executive (a) has read the
Release, (b) has been provided a full and ample opportunity to study it,
including a period of at least forty-five (45) days if Executive is over forty
(40) years old (or, if less than forty (40) years old, at least ten (10) days)
within which to consider it (although Executive may voluntarily choose to
execute the Release earlier), and (c) is signing it voluntarily with full
knowledge that it is intended, to the maximum extent permitted by law, as a
complete release and waiver of any and all claims, including without
limitation any claims under ADEA. To revoke, Executive must send a written
notice of revocation to Citizens at the address set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.6_ of this Agreement.

 

3.6 _No Assignment of Releasing Party Claims_. Executive represents and
warrants to the Released Parties that there has been no assignment or other
transfer of any interest in any Releasing Party Claim.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _INDEPENDENCE OF OBLIGATIONS_

 

The covenants of Executive set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as
independent of any other agreement or arrangement between Executive, on the
one hand, and Citizens on the other, and the existence of any claim or cause
of action by Executive against Community, Citizens, Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates (or the existence of any claim or cause of action
by Citizens or Parent against Executive, as the case may be), shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement of such covenants against Executive,
or against Citizens or Parent, as the case may be.

 



 



B4-7 ARTICLE V

 

 _GENERAL_

 

5.1 _Amendments_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, this Agreement
may be amended by agreement in writing of the parties hereto at any time.

5.2 _Integration_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings of the parties in connection
therewith.

 

5.3 _Termination._

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action in
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger.

(b) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to subsection  _(a)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the obligations of Executive under _Sections 2.1_ and
_2.2_ shall terminate at the end of the Applicable Period. The Release shall
continue to be in full force and effect indefinitely, unless this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 5.3(a).

(c) Unless sooner terminated under subsection _(a)_ of this _Section_ __
_ 5.3_, and except as provided in subsection _(b)_ of this _Section_ __ _
5.3_, the obligations of Executive under this Agreement shall terminate only
on the mutual agreement of Executive, on the one hand, and Citizens or the
Surviving Corporation, on the other hand.

 

5.4 _Specific Performance_. Executive acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable injury will result to Citizens in the event of a breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement and that Citizens may have no adequate remedy
at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material breach of
this Agreement, and in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy
Citizens may have, Executive agrees that the entry of a preliminary injunction
and a permanent injunction (including, without limitation, specific
performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the violation
or breach thereof by Executive or any Affiliates, agents, or any other
persons acting for or with Executive in any capacity whatsoever, is an
appropriate remedy for any such breach and that Executive will not oppose the
granting of such relief on the basis that Citizens has an adequate remedy at
law. Executive submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action.
In addition, after discussing the matter with Executive, Citizens shall have
the right to inform any third party that Citizens reasonably believes to be,
or to be contemplating, participating with Executive or receiving from
Executive assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this
Agreement and the rights of Citizens hereunder, and that participation by
any such persons with Executive in activities in violation of Executives
agreement with Citizens set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by
Citizens against such third party in addition to any other remedy to which
they may be entitled at law or in equity.

5.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable as to duration, activity
or subject, it shall be deemed to extend only over the maximum duration, range
of activities or subjects as to which such provision shall be valid and
enforceable under applicable Law. If any provisions shall, for any

 



B4-8  reason, be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be
construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein.

 

5.6 _Notices_. Any notice or communication required or permitted
hereunder, shall be deemed to have been given if in writing and (a) delivered
in person, (b) delivered by confirmed email transmission, (c) sent by
overnight carrier, postage prepaid with return receipt requested or (d) mailed
by certified or registered mail postage prepaid with return receipt
requested, addressed as follows:

5.7 _Waiver of Breach_. Any failure or delay by Citizens in enforcing any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver thereof. The waiver
by Citizens of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Executive shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or violation
thereof. All waivers shall be in writing and signed by the party to be bound.



 



B4-9 5.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement may be assignable by Citizens only in
connection with a sale of all or substantially all of its assets or a merger
or reorganization in which it is not the surviving corporation. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this prohibition shall be null and void.

 

5.9 _Binding Effect; Benefit to Successors_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon Executive and upon Executive s successor and representatives
and shall inure to the benefit of Citizens and its successors, representatives
and assigns.

Sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not

reports, drawings, designs, plans and proposals otherwise pertaining to same
or relating to the business and properties of Community or its subsidiaries
and Parent, Citizens and its subsidiaries of which Employee has acquired, or
may hereafter acquire, knowledge and possession as a shareholder, director,
officer or employee of Community or, if applicable, Parent or Citizens, or as
a result of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; _provided_
_however_ , notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the
contrary, "Trade Secrets" shall not include any (i) information which is
or has become available from a third party who learned the information
independently and is not or was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with
respect to such information; or (ii) information readily ascertainable from
public, trade or other nonconfidential sources (other than as a result,
directly or indirectly, of a disclosure or other dissemination in
contravention of a confidentiality agreement).



 



B5-2 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and respective
representations, warranties and covenants, agreements and conditions
contained herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, Employee and Citizens agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY EMPLOYEE_

Employee acknowledges that:

 

(a) Parent and Citizens would not enter into the Merger Agreement unless
Employee agrees not to use Trade Secrets or solicit customers and employees
in violation of this Agreement and that, accordingly, this Agreement is a
material inducement for Parent and Citizens to enter into and to carry out the
terms of the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, Employee expressly acknowledges
that [he/she] is entering into this Agreement with Citizens to induce Parent
and Citizens to enter into and carry out the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 

(b) Employee acknowledges that by virtue of [his/her] position with
Community and, if applicable, Parent and/or Citizens after the Effective Time
of the Merger, Employee has developed considerable expertise in the business
operations of Community and, if applicable, will develop considerable
expertise in the business operations of Parent and Citizens and has access to
Trade Secrets of Community and, if applicable, will have access to Trade
Secrets of Parent and Citizens upon the Effective Time of the Merger. Employee
recognizes that Parent and Citizens would be irreparably damaged, and its
substantial investment in Community materially impaired, if Employee were to
disclose or make use of any Trade Secrets in violation of the terms of this
Agreement, or if Employee were to solicit employees of Community or Citizens
as successor to Community from and after the Effective Time of the Merger in
violation of the terms of this Agreement. Accordingly, Employee expressly
acknowledges that [he/she] is voluntarily entering into this Agreement and
that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are fair and reasonable to
Employee in all respects.

ARTICLE II

 

 _NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE _

 

2.1 _Non-solicitation_. From the date of this Agreement and for the
period ending on the expiration of twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time of the Merger (the "Applicable Period"), Employee shall not, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Parent or Citizens, on
behalf of any Financial Institution,

(a) solicit or aid in the solicitation of any Customers or
Prospective Customers for Financial Services,

(b) solicit or aid in the solicitation of any officers or employees
of Community or, from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Citizens as
successor to Community, or



 



B5-3 (c) induce or attempt to induce any Person who is a Customer
or Prospective Customer, or induce or attempt to induce any supplier,
distributor, officer or employee of (i) Community as of the date hereof or
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger or (ii) Citizens
immediately prior to termination of Employees employment with Citizens, as
applicable, in each case, to terminate such persons relationships with the
Surviving Corporation.

 

The prohibitions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ shall not apply to
general solicitations or attempted solicitations by employment agencies (so
long as the agency was not directed to solicit a Person otherwise subject to
the prohibitions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.1_) or the general advertising or
general solicitations not specifically directed at such Person(s).

2.2 _Trade Secrets_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
at all times after the date hereof, other than for the benefit of Community,
or as otherwise approved by Community, and, after the Effective Time of the
Merger (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), other than for the
benefit of Parent and/or Citizens or as otherwise approved by Parent or
Citizens in writing, Employee (i) shall make no use of the Trade Secrets, or
any part thereof; (ii) shall not disclose the Trade Secrets, or any part
thereof, to any other Person, and (iii) shall deliver, on and after the
Effective Time of the Merger, upon the request of Citizens, all documents,
reports, drawings, designs, plans, proposals and other tangible evidence of
Trade Secrets, now possessed or hereafter acquired by Employee, to Parent
and/or Citizens.

2.3 _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Employee may disclose or reveal any information, whether including
in whole or in part any Trade Secrets, that Employee is required to disclose
or reveal under any applicable Law or is otherwise required to disclose or
reveal by any Governmental Authority; provided, that Employee makes a good
faith request that the confidentiality of the Trade Secrets be preserved and,
to the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws, gives Citizens prompt notice
of such requirement in advance of such disclosure and exercises reasonable
efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such Trade Secrets, including,
without limitation, by reasonably cooperating with Parent and Citizens, to
obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Trade Secrets by the
Governmental Authority or other recipient of the Trade Secrets.

 

ARTICLE III

RELEASE

 

3.1 _Release_. From and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Employee
on Employees own behalf and on behalf of Employees past, present and future
affiliates, agents, attorneys, administrators, heirs, executors, spouses,
trustees, beneficiaries, representatives, successors and assigns claiming by
or through Employee (collectively, the "Related Persons"), hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably RELEASES and FOREVER DISCHARGES (the
"Release") Community and its current or former affiliates, subsidiaries,
subdivisions, officers, directors, employees, managers, partners, principals,
advisors, agents, stockholders, members, investors, equity holders or other
representatives (including attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and
financial advisors), successors (including Citizens), predecessors or assigns
(each, a "Released Party" and collectively, the "Released Parties") from the
following (collectively, the "Releasing Party Claims"): any and all claims,
demands, allegations, 

 



B5-4  assertions, complaints, controversies, charges, duties (fiduciary or
otherwise), breaches of duties, grievances, rights, causes of action, actions,
suits, liabilities, debts, obligations, promises, commitments, agreements,
guarantees, endorsements, duties, damages, costs, losses, debts and expenses
(including attorneys fees and costs incurred) of any nature whatsoever
(whether direct or indirect, known or unknown, disclosed or undisclosed,
matured or unmatured, accrued or unaccrued, asserted or unasserted, absolute
or contingent, determined or conditional, express or implied, fixed or
variable and whether vicarious, derivative, joint, several or secondary)
relating to the Released Parties, including, without limitation, any and all
actions, activities, assets, liabilities and the ownership of any securities,
whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, absolute or contingent,
direct or indirect or nominally or beneficially possessed or claimed by
Employee, whether the same be in administrative proceedings, in arbitration,
at law, in equity or mixed, which Employee ever had, now has or hereafter may
have against any or all of the Released Parties, in respect of any and all
agreements, liabilities or obligations entered into or incurred on or prior to
the date hereof, or in respect of any event occurring or circumstances
existing on or prior to the date hereof, whether or not relating to
claims pending on, or asserted after, the date hereof; provided, however,
that the foregoing release does not extend to, include or restrict or limit in
any way, and each Releasing Party hereby reserves such Releasing Partys
rights, if any, and the right of the other Releasing Parties, if any, to
pursue any and all Releasing Party Claims that such Releasing Party may now or
in the future have solely on account of (a) any existing rights of such
Releasing Party under any severance agreement, employment agreement or other
employee benefit plan of Community of which Employee is a party or is
otherwise a beneficiary thereof, (b) any rights or claims for benefits (other
than any severance or deferred compensation) under benefit plans of Community
(or its successor) (including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, COBRA benefits and rights to account balances, earnings thereon and
forfeiture allocations), (c) rights under any applicable
workers compensation statutes arising out of compensable job related
injuries, (d) any claims relating to salary, vacation pay or other
compensation received in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (e) any rights to indemnification for serving as an officer,
director, agent or employee of Community or any affiliates of Community, or
serving at the request of Community as a trustee or fiduciary of any benefit
plan, provided that such rights exist as a matter of law or contract or
pursuant to the corporate documents of such applicable company, (f) any rights
under the Merger Agreement to the Merger Consideration and (g) any claim
which, as a matter of applicable Law, cannot be released.

 

3.2 _ADEA_. Without limiting the scope of the Release in any way, Employee
certifies that the Release constitutes a knowing and voluntary waiver of any
and all rights or claims that exist or that he/she may have or may claim to
have under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), as
amended by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990, which is set
forth at 29 U.S.C. § § 621, et seq. The Release does not govern any rights or
claims that may arise under the ADEA after the date the Release is signed by
Employee. If Employee is age 40 or over, (a) he/she is aware of his/her right
to revoke the Release at any time within the seven (7)-day period following
the date he/she signs it and that the Release shall not become effective or
enforceable until the seven (7)-day revocation period expires without
revocation; and (b) he/she has been given an opportunity to consider fully the
terms of the Release for forty-five (45) days, although Employee is not
required to wait forty-five (45) days before signing the Release. Employee
understands that he or she will relinquish any right to any retention bonuses
set forth in the Community retention bonus plan if he/she exercises his/her
right to revoke it.



 



B5-5 3.3 _No Additional Facts_. Employee agree that because the
Release specifically covers known and unknown claims, Employee waives any and
all rights under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, or under any
comparable law of any other jurisdiction. Section 1542 states:

 

"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release,
which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her
settlement with the debtor."

Employee hereby expressly waives any rights Employee may have under Section
1542 of the California Civil Code or any other applicable law to preserve
Releasing Party Claims which Employee does not know or suspect to exist in
Employees favor at the time of executing the release provided in _Section_
__ _ 3.1_. Employee understands and acknowledges that Employee may discover
facts different from, or in addition to, those which Employee knows or
believes to be true with respect to the claims released herein, and agrees
that the release provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ shall be and remain
effective in all respects notwithstanding any subsequent discovery of
different or additional facts. If Employee discovers that any fact relied
upon in entering into the release provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ was untrue,
or that any fact was concealed, or that an understanding of the facts or law
was incorrect, Employee shall not be entitled to any relief as a result
thereof, and Employee surrenders any rights Employee might have to rescind the
release provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ on any ground. Such release is
intended to be and is final and binding regardless of any claim of
misrepresentation, promise made with the intention of performing, concealment
of fact, mistake of law, or any other circumstances whatsoever.

 

3.4 _No Suits or Actions_. Employee hereby irrevocably covenants to
refrain from, and shall cause each of its Related Persons to refrain from,
asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be
commenced, any suit, proceeding or manner of action of any kind against any
Released Party based upon any Releasing Party Claim. If Employee (or any of
its Related Persons) does any of the things mentioned in the immediately
preceding sentence, then Employee shall indemnify the Released Parties (or any
of them) in the amount of the value of any final judgment or settlement
(monetary or other) and any related cost (including reasonable legal fees)
entered against, paid or incurred by the Released Parties (or any of them).

 

3.5 _Revocation_. Employee acknowledges that Employee (a) has read the
Release, (b) has been provided a full and ample opportunity to study it,
including a period of at least forty-five (45) days if Employee is over forty
(40) years old (or, if less than forty (40) years old, at least ten (10) days)
within which to consider it (although Employee may voluntarily choose to
execute the Release earlier), and (c) is signing it voluntarily with full
knowledge that it is intended, to the maximum extent permitted by law, as a
complete release and waiver of any and all claims, including without
limitation any claims under ADEA. To revoke, Employee must send a written
notice of revocation to Citizens at the address set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.6_ of this Agreement.

 

3.6 _No Assignment of Releasing Party Claims_. Employee represents and
warrants to the Released Parties that there has been no assignment or other
transfer of any interest in any Releasing Party Claim.



 



B5-6 ARTICLE IV

 

 _INDEPENDENCE OF OBLIGATIONS_

 

The covenants of Employee set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as
independent of any other agreement or arrangement between Employee, on the
one hand, and Citizens on the other, and the existence of any claim or cause
of action by Employee against Community, Citizens, Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates (or the existence of any claim or cause of action
by Citizens or Parent against Employee, as the case may be), shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement of such covenants against Employee, or
against Citizens or Parent, as the case may be.

 

ARTICLE V

_GENERAL_

 

5.1 _Amendments_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, this Agreement
may be amended by agreement in writing of the parties hereto at any time.

5.2 _Integration_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings of the parties in connection
therewith.

 

5.3 _Termination._

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action in
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger.

(b) Unless sooner terminated pursuant to subsection  _(a)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the obligations of Employee under _Sections 2.1_ and
_2.2_ shall terminate at the end of the Applicable Period. The Release shall
continue to be in full force and effect indefinitely, unless this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 5.3(a).

(c) Unless sooner terminated under subsection _(a)_ of this _Section_ __
_ 5.3_, and except as provided in subsection _(b)_ of this _Section_ __ _
5.3_, the obligations of Employee under this Agreement shall terminate
only on the mutual agreement of Employee, on the one hand, and Citizens or
the Surviving Corporation, on the other hand.

 

5.4 _Specific Performance_. Employee acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable injury will result to Citizens in the event of a breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement and that Citizens may have no adequate remedy
at law with respect thereto. Accordingly, in the event of a material breach of
this Agreement, and in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy
Citizens may have, Employee agrees that the entry of a preliminary injunction
and a permanent injunction (including, without limitation, specific
performance) by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain the violation
or breach thereof by Employee or any Affiliates, agents, or any other persons
acting for or with Employee in any capacity whatsoever, is an appropriate
remedy for any such breach and that Employee will not oppose the granting of
such relief on the 

 



B5-7  basis that Citizens has an adequate remedy at law. Employee submits to the
jurisdiction of such court in any such action. In addition, after discussing
the matter with Employee, Citizens shall have the right to inform any third
party that Citizens reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating,
participating with Employee or receiving from Employee assistance in violation
of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and the rights of Citizens
hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Employee in
activities in violation of Employees agreement with Citizens set forth in
this Agreement may give rise to claims by Citizens against such third party
in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in
equity.

5.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable as to duration, activity or
subject, it shall be deemed to extend only over the maximum duration, range of
activities or subjects as to which such provision shall be valid and
enforceable under applicable Law. If any provisions shall, for any reason, be
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall
not affect any other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be
construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein.

 

5.6 _Notices_. Any notice or communication required or permitted
hereunder, shall be deemed to have been given if in writing and (a) delivered
in person, (b) delivered by confirmed email transmission, (c) sent by
overnight carrier, postage prepaid with return receipt requested or

 

(d) mailed by certified or registered mail postage prepaid with return
receipt requested, addressed as follows:

delivered personally or delivered by confirmed facsimile transmission or on
the next Business Day after it was sent by overnight carrier, postage prepaid
with return receipt requested or on the third Business Day after it was sent
by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid with return receipt
requested.

 

5.7 _Waiver of Breach_. Any failure or delay by Citizens in enforcing any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver thereof. The waiver
by Citizens of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Employee shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or violation
thereof. All waivers shall be in writing and signed by the party to be bound.

5.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement may be assignable by Citizens only in
connection with a sale of all or substantially all of its assets or a merger
or reorganization in which it is not the surviving corporation. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this prohibition shall be null and void.

 

5.9 _Binding Effect; Benefit to Successors_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon Employee and upon Employee s successor and representatives and
shall inure to the benefit of Citizens and its successors, representatives and
assigns.

 

5.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the legal relations between the
parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of California applicable to contracts between California parties made
and performed in this State.

 

5.11 _Headings_. The descriptive headings of the several Articles and
Sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not
constitute a part of this Agreement.

5.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and

copies of the documents which are the subject of such facsimiles.

THIS AGREEMENT OF MERGER (this "Agreement of Merger") is made and entered into
as of  _ _ this day of _ _, 2018, by and among CVB
Financial Corp., a California corporation ("Parent"), Citizens Business Bank,
a California state-chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent

("Community"), in connection with the transactions described in that certain

"Reorganization Agreement"), by and among Parent, Citizens and Community.
Terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the
Reorganization Agreement.

_RECITALS_

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Citizens and Community have entered into the Reorganization
Agreement providing, among other things, for the merger of Community with and
into Citizens (the "Merger").

WHEREAS, in connection with the Reorganization Agreement, the Parties desire
to effectuate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement of Merger and the Reorganization Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that for federal income tax purposes the Merger
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this
Agreement of Merger shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" within in the
meaning of the Code.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants
and agreements herein set forth and for the purpose of prescribing the terms
and conditions of such Merger, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement of
Merger and the Reorganization Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in
Article VIII hereof), Community shall be merged with and into Citizens which
shall thereupon be surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), and
the separate corporate existence of Community shall cease.

ARTICLE II

 

 _NAME_

The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Citizens Business Bank."



 



C-1 ARTICLE III

 

 _ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION_

 

The Articles of Incorporation of Citizens as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, at and after the Effective Time, continue to be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _BYLAWS_

The Bylaws of Citizens as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, at and after the Effective Time, continue to be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

ARTICLE V

_RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SURVIVING CORPORATION_

At and after the Effective Time, all rights, privileges, powers and franchises
and all property and assets of every kind and description of Citizens and
Community shall be vested in and be held and enjoyed by the Surviving
Corporation, without further act or deed, and all the estates and interests of
every kind of Citizens and Community, including all debts due to either of
them, shall be as effectively the property of the Surviving Corporation as
they were of Citizens and Community, and the title to any real estate vested
by deed or otherwise in either Citizens or Community shall not revert or be
in any way impaired by reason of the Merger; and all rights of creditors and
liens upon any property of Citizens and Community shall be preserved
unimpaired and all debts, liabilities and duties of Citizens and Community
shall be debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation and may
be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and
duties had been incurred or contracted by it.

 

ARTICLE VI

_CONVERSION OF SHARES_

In and by virtue of the Merger and at the Effective Time, pursuant to this
Agreement of Merger and the Reorganization Agreement, the shares of Community
Common Stock and common stock of Citizens ("Citizens Common Stock")
outstanding at the Effective Time shall be treated as follows:

 

(a) _Outstanding Community Common Stock_. Each share of Community Common
Stock, excluding Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become and be
converted into the right to receive (i) $[___] in cash (the "Cash
Consideration") and (ii) [___] of a share of Parent Common Stock (the "Stock
Consideration" together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger
Consideration"), without interest thereon.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. (i) Any shares of Community Common
Stock held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent or by Community or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Community, other than those held in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of
debts previously contracted ("Excluded Shares")

 



C-2  shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the
Effective Time of the Merger and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.

 

(c) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
of Merger to the contrary, no Dissenting Shares shall be converted into or
represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for such shares set
forth in this Agreement of Merger and the Reorganization Agreement, if any,
but the holder of such Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to such
dissenters rights as are granted by Chapter 13 of the CGCL. If a holder of
shares of Community Common Stock who demands that Community purchase such
shares under Chapter 13 of the CGCL shall thereafter effectively withdraw
or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders dissenters
rights with respect to such shares of Community Common Stock then, as of the
occurrence of such withdrawal or loss, each such share of Community Common
Stock shall be deemed as of the Effective Time to have been converted into
and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

(d) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement of Merger, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be
issued and any holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu
thereof (rounded to the nearest cent), which payment shall be determined
by multiplying (i) the 20-day volume weighted average price of a share of
Parent Common Stock as quoted on NASDAQ as of the fifth (5th) Business
Day immediately prior to the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of the share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent
Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
hereunder.

 

(e) _Effect on Citizens Common Stock_. Each share of Citizens Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, on and
after the Effective Time, remain outstanding and shall automatically and for
all purposes be deemed to represent one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

ARTICLE VII

_FURTHER ACTION _

The parties hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such deeds and other instruments, and will take or cause to be
taken all further or other action as they may deem necessary or desirable, in
order to vest in and confirm to the Surviving Corporation title to and
possession of all of Citizens and Communitys property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises hereunder, and otherwise to carry out the intent and
purposes of this Agreement of Merger.

California) and all other requisite accompanying certificates in the office of

in part, by Parent and Citizens.

 

(b) The obligations of Parent and Citizens to proceed with the closing are
