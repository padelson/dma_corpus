  15.1  |   | The Parties shall consult with each other on the content and
timing of any press release or other public statement to be issued at or
around Signing with respect to the Agreement and shall not issue any such
press release or public statement prior to such consultation, except as may
be required by Law or securities exchange regulations. The Sellers agree not
to issue any press release at Signing prior to the release of the Buyers
press release.  
      
  15.2  |   | The Parties undertake not to disclose the Schedules to this
Agreement or any information relating to disputes arising out of this
Agreement, to any other party without the prior written consent of both
Parties (other than to a Partys directors, employees, or advisors, who needs
to know such information to discharge his or hers duties), except to the
extent that such disclosure is stipulated in this Agreement or is required by
Law, securities exchange regulations or any governmental filing necessary to

Buyer at Closing.

  16.1  |   | The Sellers and the Buyer shall at their own cost, on being
reasonably required to do so by the other Party, do or procure the doing of
all such acts and/or execute or procure the execution of all documents which
the requesting Party may reasonably consider necessary for giving full effect
to this Agreement and securing to the requesting Party the full benefit
of the rights, powers and remedies conferred upon such Party in this
Agreement, including but not limited to the exchange of information and
assistance with filing with any authority.  
      
  16.2  |   | The Sellers agree to reasonably consult and cooperate with
the Buyer on all matters relating to the protection of the Intellection
Property  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

Gorrissen Federspiel Kierkegaard  

  

       |   | owned by the Group. Such reasonable consultation and
cooperation shall include, without limitation, (i) executing and delivering
all such papers as may be necessary or desirable to obtain rights to and
perfect the title to said Intellectual Property for the Group, the Buyer, its
successors, assigns, nominees or legal representatives, as applicable, (ii)
communicating to the Buyer or to its successors, assigns, nominees or legal
representatives known facts respecting the Intellectual Property owned by
the Group, (iii) testifying in any legal proceedings, (iv) signing all lawful
papers, (v) executing all rightful disclaimers and divisional, continuing,
re-issue and foreign applications and (vi) making all rightful oaths and
generally doing everything reasonably possible to aid the Buyer, its
successors, assigns, nominees and legal representatives to obtain and enforce
proper protection for said Intellection Property in any and all countries.  
---|---|--- 
      
  16.3  |   | In the event the Buyer determines that it is required to
file a Form 8-k with the US Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, the Sellers agree to deliver to or procure the Group to deliver to
the Purchaser such consolidated financial statements for the Group, audited by
the Companys independent public accountants in accordance with US generally
accepted auditing standards and prepared in accordance with or reconciled to
GAAP, as required pursuant to the Form 8-k in sufficient time for the Buyer
to file the Form 8-k with the SEC. All costs and fees, if any, which may be
incurred by the Sellers and the Group for the above purposes will be promptly
reimbursed by the Buyer.  
      
  16.4  |   | The Sellers will cause the Company to prepare and file the
corporate income tax returns for all Group Companies for returns due before
or on the Closing Date and, as appropriate, address all queries relating to
these returns from the relevant Tax authorities. For returns covering periods
up to the date of Closing but due after the date of Closing, the Buyer shall
cause the Company to prepare and file such returns. Whether these returns are
due before or after the Closing Date, the Parties agree to prepare such
returns on the basis of good faith and   
  

  ##### 

  

  

    

  

Gorrissen Federspiel Kierkegaard  

   

historical practices (e.g., depreciation methods, annual elections, etc.) to
the extent appropriate and in accordance with Law. 

   

The Parties shall provide each other access to such information that is
relevant and is reasonably necessary to address these returns covering
periods up to the Closing Date (whether due before or after Closing) and keep
the other Party fully informed of the status and any actions taken with
respect to these matters, including copies of relevant documentation. With
respect to returns prepared prior to or on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
also have the right to review such returns; and with respect to returns
relating to periods preceding the Closing Date but prepared after the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall have the right to review such returns. The
Sellers and the Buyer also have a right to review any correspondence with
respect to the Tax authorities prior to submission and the Parties agree to
consult and resolve in good faith any issues arising as a result of such
reviews. 

   

After the Closing Date, the Parties will provide and will cause their
Affiliates to provide the other party with such cooperation and information
as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax
return, amended Tax return, determining a liability for Taxes or
participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes. Without limiting the scope of the foregoing, the Parties shall each
make available to the other, as reasonably requested, all information,
records or documents in their possession relating to all Tax matters and Tax
returns of the Group Companies for all tax periods prior to or including
the Closing Date and shall preserve all such information, records and
documents until sixty (60) days after the expiration of any applicable Tax
statute of limitations or extensions thereof. 

   

During 2008 the Buyer and the Group shall not be entitled to file for
any rulings/obtain pre-approvals etc. ("Ruling" or "Rulings") with the Tax
authorities about matters that could have an adverse impact on the Groups
Tax position as reflected on the September Balance Sheet unless (i) the Buyer
in advance provides evidence to the Sellers that such Rulings are
specifically required by Law or (ii) the Rulings have 

   ##### 

  

  

Gorrissen Federspiel Kierkegaard  

   

been pre-approved by the Sellers (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld). To the extent the Buyer or a Group Company files for a Ruling in
2008 which adversely affects the Groups Tax position on the September
Balance Sheet without complying with one of these two conditions, the Buyer
shall not be entitled to any indemnification for Tax claims pursuant to
Clause 10.8.2 specifically with respect to the amount of the adverse impact
caused by the Ruling on the Groups Tax position or caused by any Tax audit
on any Tax matter initiated as a result of the request for a Ruling by
the Buyer/Group. In the pre-approval process, the Sellers will consider the
need for a Ruling in good faith also taking into consideration the commercial
need, if any, for the Group to make changes to the business set-up etc. If
the Parties do not agree on the need for filing for a Ruling, they agree to
appoint an independent Tax expert (mutually satisfactory and costs to be
shared) to review the need for filing for a Ruling and the Parties agree to
follow the conclusions reached by the independent Tax expert. 

   

The Buyer accepts that the Group as a main rule shall continue to apply
in 2008 the existing transfer pricing set-up for Tax purposes. To the extent
that the Buyer/Group during 2008 determines a need for material changes to
the transfer pricing methodologies and/or documentation of the Group, the
Buyer agrees to present to the Sellers the proposed material changes prior to
the implementation thereof. In this regard, the term "material changes" as
used in this paragraph are those changes, which the Buyer reasonably believes
may have an adverse impact on the Groups Tax position on the September
Balance Sheet, or which the Buyer reasonably believes may provoke a Tax audit
by a Tax authority relative to periods ending before or on the Closing Date
based on the degree and magnitude of the change in transfer pricing
methodology. Solely for purposes of determining the validity of
indemnification claims made with respect to transfer pricing under Clause
10.8.6, the Sellers have the right to reject the implementation of
the proposed changes presented by the Buyer in 2008 if and to the extent the
Buyer is unable to provide evidence to the Sellers (i) that the proposed
material changes are required to be implemented by Law; (ii) that the
proposed material changes probably will not have an adverse effect on the
Groups Tax position for any period prior to the 

   ##### 

  

  

Gorrissen Federspiel Kierkegaard  

  

       |   | September Balance Sheet; (iii) that the proposed material
changes are prudent per the recommendations of Deloitte or KPMG (which were
made available to the Buyer as part of due diligence) or (iv) that the Buyer
is willing to waive the right to seek indemnification under Clause 10.8.6
relative to the specific transfer pricing change being made and limited to
the monetary extent of such change and any other transfer pricing liability
of the Group, for which the Buyer may seek indemnification from the Sellers,
caused by any Tax audit as a result of the transfer pricing change being
made. Absent agreement between the Buyer and the Sellers that such
requirements are fulfilled the Parties agree to refer the decision in respect
thereof to an independent Tax expert appointed jointly by the Parties
(mutually satisfactory and costs shared), and the Parties shall accept the
conclusions of such Tax expert.

  17  |   | No Assignment  
      
  17.1  |   | This Agreement or any rights according to this Agreement is
not assignable by either of the Parties, except that the Buyer is entitled to
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a directly or
indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, provided that the Buyer undertakes to
guarantee for the obligations of such subsidiary as if they were the Buyers
own obligations under this Agreement (in Danish " _selvskyldnerkaution_ ").
