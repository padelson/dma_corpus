Exhibit 2.1

 

EXPLANATORY NOTE TO THIS EXHIBIT

The representations and warranties included in this Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the "Merger Agreement") were made by the parties to the Merger
Agreement for their respective contractual benefit. These representations and
warranties are made as of specific dates, only for purposes of the Merger
Agreement and for the benefit of the parties thereto. These representations
and warranties are subject to important exceptions and limitations agreed upon
by the parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures, made
for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties rather
than establishing these matters as facts, and were made subject to a
contractual standard of materiality that may differ from the standard
generally applicable under federal securities laws. The Merger Agreement is
filed with this report only to provide investors with information regarding
its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information
regarding the Company or its business. Information concerning the subject
matter of the representations and warranties may have changed, and may
continue to change, since the date of the Merger Agreement, and such
subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Companys
public reports. The information in the Merger Agreement should be considered
together with the Companys public reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The schedules to the Merger Agreement have been omitted.
The Company agrees to furnish supplementally a copy of any omitted schedule to
the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission upon request.

This is an Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement"), dated as of
September 22, 2016, among WCI Communities, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware
corporation, Lennar Corporation ("Parent"), a Delaware corporation, Marlin
Blue LLC ("LLC Sub"), a Delaware limited liability company and a direct,

and, together with LLC Sub, "Merger Subs"), a Delaware corporation and a

unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Mergers, and declared that this Agreement and the
Mergers are advisable, and (iii) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions

vote all the shares of Company Common Stock they own, or as to which they for
any other reason have voting power, in favor of adopting this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Corporate Sub, and the
sole member of LLC Sub, each has (i) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement, and (ii) approved the execution and delivery by Parent, LLC Sub and

WHEREAS, Parent, LLC Sub, Corporate Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,

and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent,
LLC Sub, Corporate Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I __

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1 ___The_ _Mergers_. On the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL"), at the First Effective Time, Corporate Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company (the "Initial Merger"), the separate corporate existence of
Corporate Sub shall thereupon cease and the

 



1  Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Initial Merger
(the "Initial Surviving Entity"). As a result of the Initial Merger, the
Company will become a direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Immediately
following the Initial Merger, in accordance with the DGCL and the Limited
Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (the "LLC Act" and, together
with the DGCL, "Delaware Law"), the Initial Surviving Entity shall be merged
with and into LLC Sub (the "Subsequent Merger" and together or _in seriatim_
with the Initial Merger, as appropriate, the "Mergers"), the separate
corporate existence of the Initial Surviving Entity shall thereupon cease and
LLC Sub (which is sometimes called the "Final Surviving Entity") shall
continue as the surviving company of the Subsequent Merger.

Section 1.2 _ _ _Closing_. The closing (the "Closing") of the Mergers shall
take place at the office of Goodwin Procter LLP, 620 Eighth Avenue, New York,
New York 10018, prior to 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the first Business
Day after the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the
Party or Parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ (other than (a) those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions and (b) conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ that no longer apply by their terms if the Merger Consideration
is being paid entirely as Cash Consideration), or at such other time and date
as may be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company; _provided_ , if
(1) all conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VI_ are satisfied (other
than (i) those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing (and subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waiver of those conditions) and (ii) conditions that no longer apply by their
terms if the Merger Consideration is being paid entirely as Cash
Consideration) or (to the extent permitted by Law) are waived by the Party or
Parties entitled to the benefits thereof, other than the Company Stockholder
Approval, and (2) the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained prior to 9:00
a.m., New York City time on a Business Day, then the Closing shall
occur immediately thereafter and in any case prior to 9:30 a.m., New York
City time, on the day of the Company Stockholder Approval. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

 

Section 1.3 _ _ _Effective Times of the Mergers_. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, prior to 9:30 a.m. New York
City time on the Closing Date, the Company shall file a certificate of merger
with respect to the Initial Merger satisfying the applicable requirements of
the DGCL (the "First Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware. The Initial Merger shall become effective upon the
filing of the First Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as Parent and the Company agree and
specify in the First Certificate of Merger but in no event later than 9 a.m.
New York City time on the Closing Date (the "First Effective Time").
Immediately following the First Effective Time, subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, LLC Sub shall file a certificate of merger with respect to the
Subsequent Merger satisfying the applicable requirements of Delaware Law (the
"Second Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware. The Subsequent Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Second Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware immediately after the First Effective Time (the "Second Effective
Time"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Parent has
delivered the Cash Election Notice pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent may
elect that there will not be a Subsequent Merger.

 



2 Section 1.4 _ _ _Effects_. The Mergers shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, (a) at the
First Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Corporate Sub shall vest in the Initial Surviving Entity, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of Corporate Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Initial Surviving Entity, and the Initial Merger
will have all the other effects provided in Section 259 of the DGCL, and (b)
at the Second Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Initial Surviving Entity shall vest in the Final Surviving
Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Initial Surviving Entity
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Final Surviving Entity,
and the Subsequent Merger will have all the other effects provided in Section
259 of the DGCL and Section 18-209 of the LLC Act.

 

Section 1.5 _ _ _Formation Documents_.

 

(a) At the First Effective Time, (i) the certificate of incorporation of the
Company as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ , and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation shall
be the certificate of incorporation of the Initial Surviving Entity until
thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL
and such certificate of incorporation, and (ii) the bylaws of Corporate Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time, shall become the
bylaws of the Initial Surviving Entity, except that references to the name of
Corporate Sub shall be replaced with references to the name of the Initial
Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the Initial
Surviving Entity and such bylaws.

(b) At the Second Effective Time, (i) the certificate of formation of LLC Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall become the
certificate of formation of the Final Surviving Entity, until thereafter
amended as provided by applicable Law, and (ii) the limited liability company
operating agreement of LLC Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time shall become the limited liability company operating agreement
of the Final Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended as provided
by applicable Law.

Section 1.6 _ _ _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) The directors and officers of Corporate Sub immediately prior to the First
Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Initial Surviving
Entity until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

 

(b) The managers and officers of LLC Sub immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time shall be the managers and officers of the Final Surviving
Entity until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

 



3 ARTICLE II

 

 _EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK AND EQUITY AWARDS_ _;_

 

 __ _PAYMENT_ _PROCEDURES_

 

Section 2.1 _ _ _Effect on Company Common Stock of Initial Merger_.

 

(a) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the Initial Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subs, the Company or any holder of
any shares of Company Common Stock, each share of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately before the First Effective Time will be converted into
and become the right to receive the Cash Consideration plus the
Share Consideration, if any (together, the "Merger Consideration");
_provided_ that in no event shall the total value of the Merger Consideration
be less than $23.50, valuing the Share Consideration, if any, at the Market
Value.

 

(b) Subject to the last sentence of _Section 2.1(c)(vii)_ and taking into
account adjustments to the consideration payable to persons listed on
Schedule 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule required by the proviso clause
of _Section 2.3(b)_ , unless Parent has delivered a Cash Election Notice, if
the Total COI Share Consideration would be less than 41% of the Total COI
Merger Consideration, then, the Share Consideration will automatically be
increased such that the Total COI Share Consideration would be equal to 41% of
the Total COI Merger Consideration; _provided_ that, for the avoidance
of doubt, such increase in the Share Consideration will not reduce the amount
of the Cash Consideration below $11.75, even if that causes the Merger
Consideration to exceed $23.50. This _Section 2.1(b)_ (taken in conjunction
with the proviso clause of _Section 2.3(b)_ ) is intended to ensure that the
"continuity of proprietary interest" requirement of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-1(e) is met (if Parent has not delivered the Cash Election
Notice pursuant to the terms hereof) and shall be construed to effectuate
such intent.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term:

 

(i) "Additional Cash Consideration" shall mean, if any, the total increases in
the Cash Consideration that are contemplated by this _Section 2.1_. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Additional Cash Consideration be
less than $0.

 

(ii) "All COI Company Common Stock" shall mean all Company Stock outstanding
immediately before the First Effective Time (including Restricted Shares for
which payment is made pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ and, for this purpose,
shares that are the subject of outstanding awards pursuant to the LTI Plans
for which payment is made pursuant to Section 2.3(a) (such awards, together
with the Restricted Shares, the "Stock Awards")).

(iii) "Cash Consideration" shall mean an amount in cash equal to (i) $11.75
plus (ii) any Additional Cash Consideration.

 

(iv) "Cash Election Notice" shall mean a written, irrevocable notice to the
Company given prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the NYSE trading day
prior to the Closing Date, that reduces the Share Consideration to zero, in
which case the Cash Consideration shall be increased to $23.50 (and the Merger
Consideration would therefore equal $23.50 in cash).

 



4 (v) "Market Value" shall mean the average of the VWAP of a share of Parent
Class A Stock on each of the ten NYSE trading days immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

 

(vi) "Pre-Closing Date Value" shall mean the last sale price of the Parent
Class A Stock reported on the NYSE on the last trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date.

(vii) "Share Consideration" shall mean, subject to _Section 2.1(b)_ , that
number (including a fractional number) of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Class A Stock (which will be unrestricted and
freely-tradeable upon receipt, other than because of restrictions relating
solely to the recipient), equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i)
$11.75 by (ii) the Market Value; _provided_ that, without limiting _Section
2.1(b)_ , Parent may, by written notice given to the Company prior to 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the NYSE trading day prior to the Closing Date,
reduce the amount of the Share Consideration by a number (including a
fractional number) of shares of Parent Class A Stock, in which case the Cash
Consideration shall be increased by the amount equal to the reduction in the
Market Value of the Share Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent
shall be permitted, pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence by
delivering a Cash Election Notice, pursuant to the terms hereof, to reduce the
Share Consideration to zero, in which case the Cash Consideration will be
increased to $23.50, and will be the entire Merger Consideration.

 

(viii) "Total COI Cash Consideration" shall mean (A) the total amount of Cash
Consideration payable with respect to All COI Company Common Stock (including
the value of the Merger Consideration that would otherwise be paid with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock as to which the holders have
demanded appraisal in accordance with the DGCL (treating such Merger
Consideration as being converted entirely into cash, valuing the Share
Consideration at the greater of Market Value or Pre-Closing Date Value)), plus
(B) the Fractional Share Consideration, in each case treating any amounts
withheld pursuant to _Section 2.7(f)_ as having been paid.

(ix) "Total COI Merger Consideration" shall mean the sum of (1) the Total COI
Share Consideration and (2) the Total COI Cash Consideration.

 

(x) "Total COI Share Consideration" shall mean the value of the total number
of shares of Parent Class A Stock (valued at the Pre-Closing Date Value) that
will be issued as a result of the Initial Merger with respect to All COI
Company Common Stock.

 

(xi) "VWAP" shall mean the volume weighted average price (as reported by
Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually selected by the Parties).

 



5 (d) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and
each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent or Merger Subs, immediately
before the First Effective Time will, at the First Effective Time, be
cancelled and cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration will be delivered
with respect to any such shares.

 

(e) No fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock will be issued as a result of
the Merger. All fractional shares that a single holder of Company Common
Stock would be otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who, but for this _Section 2.1(e)_ , would be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Class A Stock will
receive, instead of that fraction of a share, cash equal to the Market Value
of a share of Parent Class A Stock times that fraction (the "Fractional Share
Consideration"). The fraction of a share to which a holder of Company Common
Stock is entitled will be rounded to four decimal places (with .00005 rounded
up).

Section 2.2 _Corporate Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of Corporate Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into one newly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Initial Surviving Entity.

Section 2.3 _Effect on E_ _quity Awards of the Initial Merger_.

 

(a) At the First Effective Time, each outstanding award under the Companys
Amended and Restated 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan and Amended and Restated
2013 Director Long Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the "LTI Plans") that is
outstanding at that time, whether or not it is vested or subject to possible
forfeiture, will become the right to receive at the First Effective Time an
amount in cash equal to (i) the greater of (A) $23.50 and (B)(x) the Cash
Consideration plus (y) the value of the total Share Consideration, if any,
based on the Market Value, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that would have been issuable upon settlement of such award. The
payment with regard to an award under an LTI Plan will not be forfeitable even
if immediately prior the First Effective Time such award (or a portion
thereof) was subject to possible forfeiture in the future.

(b) At the First Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock granted
pursuant to the Companys 2013 Incentive Award Plan (such shares, "Restricted
Shares" and such plan, the "Equity Plan") that is outstanding at that time and
is unvested or otherwise subject to possible forfeiture, will become vested
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and will be cancelled and become
a right to receive at the First Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the
greater of (A) $23.50 and (B)(x) the Cash Consideration plus (y) the value of
the total Share Consideration, if any, based on the Market Value (such greater
amount, the "Restricted Share Consideration"); _provided_ that, to the extent,
if any, that paying cash to any person listed in Schedule 2.3 of the Company
Disclosure Letter with regard to that persons unvested Restricted Shares
would require (or contribute to a requirement) under _Section 2.1(b)_ that the
Share Consideration be increased, that person will receive with regard to
those unvested Restricted Shares the combination of Share Consideration and
Cash Consideration constituting the Merger Consideration. The right to receive
that payment with regard to a Restricted Share will not be forfeitable even
if immediately prior the First Effective Time the Restricted Share was subject
to possible forfeiture in the future.

 



6 (c) Each performance share unit award granted pursuant to the Equity Plan that
is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (even though
unvested or subject to possible forfeiture) will be terminated immediately
prior to the First Effective Time in exchange for a right to receive at the
First Effective Time an amount in cash equal to (i) the greater of (A) $23.50
and (B)(x) the Cash Consideration plus (y) the value of the total Share
Consideration, if any, based on the Market Value, multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that would otherwise have become
issuable thereafter pursuant to the terms of the applicable performance share
unit award agreement had such award vested and been settled in shares. The
right to receive that payment with regard to a performance share unit award
will not be forfeitable even if immediately prior the First Effective Time the
performance share unit award was subject to possible forfeiture in the future.

 

(d) Each restricted share unit granted pursuant to the Equity Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time, whether or not it
is vested or subject to possible forfeiture, will be terminated in exchange
for a right to receive at the First Effective Time an amount in cash equal to
(i) the greater of (A) $23.50 and (B)(x) the Cash Consideration plus (y) the
value of the total Share Consideration, if any, based on the Market Value,
multiplied by (ii) the number of restricted share units subject to such award.
The right to receive that payment with regard to a restricted share
unit award will not be forfeitable even if immediately prior the First
Effective Time the restricted share unit award was subject to possible
forfeiture in the future.

 

(e) Payments described in this _Section 2.3_ (collectively, the "Equity Award
Consideration") with regard to the equity awards described in this _Section
2.3_ (collectively, the "Equity Awards") shall be subject to applicable tax
withholdings under the Code, or any provision of any state, local or foreign
tax Law, in accordance with  _Section 2.7(f)_ hereof.

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) If Section 262 of the DGCL applies to the Initial Merger, notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time that is held by
stockholders who have demanded appraisal in accordance with, and otherwise
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (including making a timely demand for
appraisal and not voting in favor of or consenting to the adoption of this
Agreement) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Instead, if the Initial Merger takes place, Parent will pay the
holders of those shares the fair value of the shares determined as provided
in Section 262 of the DGCL. Shares held by stockholders who fail to perfect,
or who otherwise properly withdraw or lose, their rights to receive the fair
value of their shares determined as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL will
be deemed to have been converted, at the later of the First Effective Time or
the time the stockholders withdraw or lose their rights to receive the fair
value of their shares, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest or any consideration similar to interest.

(b) The Company will promptly give Parent (i) notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, any withdrawals of any such demands, and
any other communications required by, or relating to, Section 262 of the DGCL
which the Company receives and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal

 



7  under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company will not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demand for
payment of the fair value of shares or offer to settle or settle any such
demand.

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and
the First Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
Parent Class A Stock are changed into a different number of shares or a
different type of securities by reason of a reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar event, or
any dividend payable in stock or other securities is declared with regard to
the Company Common Stock or the Parent Class A Stock with a record date
between the date of this Agreement and the First Effective Time, the Share
Consideration will be adjusted so that the Initial Merger will have the same
economic effect on the holders of Company Common Stock as that contemplated by
this Agreement if there had been no such event.

 

Section 2.6 _Effect of Subsequent Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, by
virtue of the Subsequent Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
LLC Sub or the Initial Surviving Entity, (i) the equity interests in LLC Sub
that are outstanding immediately before the Second Effective Time will
continue to be outstanding and will constitute the same equity interests
in the Final Surviving Entity, and (ii) each share of common stock of the
Initial Surviving Entity issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Second Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered
with respect to any such shares, with the effect that immediately after the
Second Effective Time, the equity interests in LLC Sub that are outstanding
immediately before the Second Effective Time will be the only equity
interests in the Final Surviving Entity and Parent shall continue as the sole
member of the Final Surviving Entity.

 

Section 2.7 _Delivery of Merger Consideration and Equity Award
Consideration_.

 

(a) At least five days prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to
act as Distribution Agent in connection with the Mergers (the "Distribution
Agent"). At, or immediately before, the First Effective Time, Parent will
provide to the Distribution Agent (i) immediately available funds in an
amount sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and any dividends payable pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_ , and
(ii) shares of Parent Class A Stock sufficient to pay any Share Consideration
(assuming for this purpose that no holder of Company Common Stock will
perfect a right under Section 262 of the DGCL to receive the appraised value
of shares of Company Common Stock and no Company Common Stock is used for
purposes of withholdings in accordance with _Section 2.7(f)_ ) (such funds
and shares of Parent Class A Stock, together with any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to those shares of Parent Class A Stock,
being the "Distribution Assets"), in each case, for the sole benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the event that the cash or
shares of Parent Class A Stock held by the Distribution Agent as Distribution
Assets will not be sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration, the Fractional
Share Consideration and any dividends payable under _Section 2.7(e)_ , Parent
shall promptly deliver additional funds or additional shares of Parent Class A
Stock to the Distribution Agent in an amount equal to the deficiency. The
Distribution Assets shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly
provided for in this Agreement. Until the

 



8  Distribution Agent uses funds provided to it to pay the Cash Consideration,
the Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under _Section 2.7(e)_ ,
such funds shall be invested by the Distribution Agent, as directed by
Parent, in short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or
obligations of an agency of the United States that are backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States, in commercial paper obligations rated
P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit or bankers
acceptances issued by commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus
and undivided profits aggregating more than $10 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of the banks which are then publicly available),
and any income or gain from those investments will constitute additional
Distribution Assets; _provided_ that no gain or loss from the investment of
funds held by the Distribution Agent will affect the amounts payable to
holders of Company Common Stock hereunder, and all earnings with regard to the
Distribution Assets will be for the account of Parent. If at any time it is
determined that the funds or Parent Class A Stock that the Distribution Agent
is holding as Distribution Assets exceeds what the Distribution Agent will be
required to distribute as Merger Consideration, the Distribution Agent will
promptly return to Parent the excess funds or excess shares of Parent Class A
Stock that the Distribution Agent is holding.

 

(b) The shares of Parent Class A Stock held by the Distribution Agent will be
deemed to be outstanding from and after the Effective Time (except that
excess shares returned to Parent as provided in _Section 2.7(a)_ will be
deemed never to have been outstanding), but until they are distributed to
former holders of Company Common Stock, the Distribution Agent will not vote
those shares or exercise any rights of a shareholder with regard to them.

(c) Promptly after the First Effective Time (but in no event later than two
Business Days after the First Effective Time), Parent shall cause the
Distribution Agent to mail, or arrange for electronic delivery, to each Person
who was a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately before
the First Effective Time (with as many additional copies as the record holder
reasonably requests for delivery to beneficial owners) (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to shares of Company Common Stock
represented by stock certificates ("Certificates") shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Distribution Agent, and which shall
include customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message"
with respect to shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of shares of Company
Common Stock in order to receive the Merger Consideration, including any
amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends
or other distributions on shares of Parent Class A Stock that are
distributable in accordance with _Section 2.7(e)_. When the Distribution
Agent receives shares of Company Common Stock, together with a properly
completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other customary documents
that may be reasonably required by the Distribution Agent or, if such shares
are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a
book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares to the Distribution
Agent on a book-entry account statement, the holder of such shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Distribution Agent will
promptly deliver to the holder, or as directed by the holder in the applicable
letter of transmittal or agents message, the Merger Consideration, including
any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Class A Stock that are
distributable in accordance with _Section 2.7(e)_ , that such holder 

 



9  has the right to receive in respect of shares of Company Common Stock
delivered to the Distribution Agent. No interest will be paid or accrued on
the Merger Consideration issuable upon the surrender of shares of Company
Common Stock. If Merger Consideration is to be distributed to a Person other
than the Person in whose name surrendered shares of Company Common Stock are
registered, (i) if the shares are represented by a Certificate, the
surrendered Certificate must be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer, and (ii) the Person who surrenders the shares (whether or
not they are represented by a Certificate) must provide funds for payment
of any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the shares or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that any stock transfer
Taxes applicable to such transfer have been paid. After the First Effective
Time, a Certificate that has not been surrendered will no longer represent,
and uncertificated shares reflected on the records of the Companys transfer
agent will no longer constitute, stock of the Company, and instead they will
represent or constitute only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration and
any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Class A Stock
distributable in accordance with _Section 2.7(e)_ , with regard to what had
been shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(d) Each holder of an Equity Award shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the applicable Equity Award Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of such Equity Award in accordance with _Section
2.3_ , and Parent shall, through its or the Final Surviving Entitys payroll
system, deliver the applicable Equity Award Consideration to such holder on
the Closing Date.

(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Class A Stock
with a record date after the First Effective Time shall be paid to the former
holder of any unsurrendered shares of Company Common Stock with respect to the
shares of Parent Class A Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and
other distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Distribution Agent and
shall be included in the Distribution Assets, in each case until the surrender
of such shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such shares
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) the Distribution Agent shall distribute
to the Person entitled to receive the Parent Class A Stock included in the
Merger Consideration with regard to the surrendered shares, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the First Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Parent Class A Stock and (ii) when paid by Parent, the amount of
any dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Class A Stock with a record date after the First Effective Time but
prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender.

 

(f) If the Distribution Agent is required to withhold any portion of the
Merger Consideration payable to any Person under the Code, or any provision
of any state, local or foreign tax Law, the Distribution Agent will withhold
from the Cash Consideration (and if the Cash Consideration is not sufficient,
out of the Share Consideration) payable to that Person the sum that it
is required to withhold and shall pay that sum to the applicable taxing
authority. Any sum that is withheld and paid to the applicable taxing
authority as permitted by this _Section 2.7(f)_ will be deemed to have been
distributed to the Person with regard to whom it is withheld.

 



10 (g) If a Certificate that prior to the First Effective Date represented shares
of Company Common Stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Distribution
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the shares it
represents, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , including any amount payable in respect of
Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Class A Stock distributable in accordance with _Section
2.7(e)_.

(h) At any time which is more than 12 months after the First Effective Time,
Parent may require the Distribution Agent to return to Parent any funds and
any shares of Parent Class A Stock which have been provided to the
Distribution Agent but have not been disbursed to former holders of Company
Common Stock (including dividends received by the Distribution Agent in
respect of those shares of Parent Class A Stock), and after the funds and
shares have been returned to Parent, former stockholders of the Company must
look to Parent for issuance of the Merger Consideration, including the
Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Class A Stock in accordance with _Section 2.7(e)_ , upon
surrender of the Certificates that formerly represented, or book entry
transfer of, shares of Company Common Stock.

(i) None of Parent, the Final Surviving Entity or the Distribution Agent will
be liable to any former stockholder of the Company for any Merger
Consideration which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(j) After the First Effective Time, neither the Initial Surviving Entity nor
the Final Surviving Entity will record any transfers of shares of Company
Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company, the Initial Surviving
Entity or the Final Surviving Entity, and the stock ledger of the Company will
be closed. If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates or uncertificated
shares are presented for transfer, they will be cancelled and treated as
having been surrendered for the Merger Consideration (which will be paid upon
receipt of a properly completed letter of transmittal or an Agents Notice
and any other documents reasonably requested by Parent).

ARTICLE III __

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except (a) as set forth in the disclosure letter that has been prepared by the
Company and delivered by the Company to Parent in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"),
_provided_ that nothing in the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to
broaden the scope of any representation or warranty of the Company made
herein, or (b) as disclosed in publicly available registration statements,
certifications, reports and proxy statements, filed by the Company with, or
furnished by the Company to, the SEC on or after September 1, 2013, and prior
to the date of this Agreement, the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and the Merger Subs that:

 



11 Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware.

 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries each has the requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted.

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation in each state of the United States in which it is required
to be qualified, except states in which the failure to qualify, in aggregate,
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

Section 3.2 _Corporate Authority and Approval_.

 

(a) The Company has all corporate power and authority necessary to enable it
to enter into this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, perform its obligations hereunder and carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All corporate actions necessary
to authorize the Company to enter into this Agreement and carry out the
transactions contemplated by it, other than obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, have been taken. This Agreement has been duly executed by the
Company and, assuming this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Merger Subs, this Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Enforceability Exception.

 

(b) The Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Mergers, and declared that this Agreement
and the Mergers are advisable, and (iii) resolved, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, to recommend that the Companys
stockholders vote all the shares of Company Common Stock they own, or as to

Agreement (the "Company Board Recommendation"); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company Board Recommendation was made subject to the understanding
that it may be withheld, amended, withdrawn, qualified or modified in
compliance with the terms of _Section 5.3(d)_.

Section 3.3 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) Other than the Company Stockholder Approval, assuming that
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.18_ are true and
correct, if the consents described on _Section 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter are obtained, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
of any document to be delivered in accordance with this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by any
document to be delivered in accordance with this Agreement will violate,
result in a breach of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, any agreement or
instrument 

 



12  to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which
any of them is bound, any Law, or any order, rule or regulation of any court
or other governmental agency or any other regulatory or quasi-regulatory
organization having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
except violations, breaches or defaults that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, the Final Surviving Entity or Parent.

(b) No governmental filings, authorizations, approvals or consents, or other
governmental action, other than the termination or expiration of waiting
periods under the HSR Act, if any, are required to permit the Company to
fulfill all its obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 3.4 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized stock of the Company consists of 150,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share. At the date of this Agreement, the only outstanding stock of
the Company is not more than 26,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock. All
those shares have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-
assessable. Except as set forth on _Section 3.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company has not issued any options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities which are outstanding, and is not a party to any
other agreements, which require (or upon the passage of time, the payment of
money or the occurrence of any other event may require) the Company to issue
or sell any of its stock.

 

(b) No shares of Company Common Stock, and no instruments that are convertible
into, exchangeable for, or the value of which is determined in whole or in
part by reference to, capital stock of the Company, are held by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement regarding the voting of shares of Company Common Stock
or committing the Company to register shares of Company Common Stock under
the Securities Act. No holder of Company Common Stock or other securities of
the Company is entitled under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws, or under any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, to preemptive rights with regard to Company Common
Stock or any other securities issued by the Company.

 

(d) Exhibit 21.1 to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 (the "Company 10-K") and _Section 3.4(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter together contain a complete list of all Subsidiaries
of the Company. Each Subsidiary of the Company has been duly organized and is
validly existing and, to the extent the concept is applicable, in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it was formed, except
where the failure to be duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
would not have, or reasonably be expected to have, in aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. All the shares of stock or other equity
interests in each of those Subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly owned
by the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and, with regard
to stock of corporations or other equity interests in limited liability
entities, are fully paid and non-assessable (to the extent such terms are
applicable to the applicable entity form), none of

 



13  those shares or other equity interests is subject to any preemptive rights,
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has issued any options,
warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities, or is a party to any
other agreements which require (or upon the passage of time, the payment of
money or the occurrence of any other event may require) the Company or any
Subsidiary to issue or transfer any shares of or other equity interests in
any Subsidiary of the Company, and there are no registration covenants or
transfer or voting restrictions with respect to any shares of or other equity
interests in any of the Companys Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any actual or
contingent obligation to make, after the date of this Agreement, an equity
investment in any entity (other than the Companys wholly owned Subsidiaries),
whether by purchasing equity securities of the entity, making contributions to
the capital of the entity, paying sums owed by the entity (as a guarantor of
the entitys material obligations or in any other manner).

Section 3.5 _Company SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

(a) Since July 1, 2014, the Company has filed with the SEC all forms, reports
and documents it has been required to file under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act.

(b) The Company 10-K and the Companys Report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended June 30, 2016 which was filed with the SEC (the "Company 10-Q") each
contained in all material respects all the information required to be
included in it and, when filed, did not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required in order to make the
statements made in it, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Without limiting what is said in the preceding sentence,
the financial statements included in the Company 10-K all were prepared, and
the financial information included in the Company 10-Q was derived from
financial statements which were prepared, in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent
basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of the
Company 10-Q, except that interim financial information does not contain all
the notes required with regard to financial statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP and is subject to normal year-end adjustments) and present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial condition and the
consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the
dates, and for the periods, to which they relate. Except as described in the
notes to the financial information in the Company 10-Q, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) owns any interests in any entities
whose financial statements are not included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the Company 10-Q and to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made capital contributions or
otherwise transferred assets with a value totaling more than $5 million as to
any single entity or more than $10 million in total, or the operating results
of which are reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company
and its Subsidiaries on an equity basis, or (ii) is a guarantor of, or may
otherwise be liable for, indebtedness of any entity whose financial statements
are not included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in the Company 10-Q totaling more than $5 million as to any
single entity or more than $10 million in total.

(c) _Internal Controls_. The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and a system of internal control over financial reporting that meet
the requirements of

 



14  Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Since January 1, 2015, the Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent quarterly evaluations of internal
control over financial reporting, to the Companys auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board all significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information.

 

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, that would be required to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared in
accordance with GAAP, other than (i) liabilities reflected on the balance
sheet included in the Company 10-Q, (ii) liabilities under borrowing
arrangements disclosed in the notes to the financial statements in the Company
10-K or to the financial information in the Company 10-Q, (iii) contingent
obligations disclosed in the managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations included in the Company 10-K or the
Company 10-Q, (iv) liabilities that were incurred after June 30, 2016 in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (v) liabilities
that were incurred under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (vi) liabilities that would not have, or
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

Section 3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since June 30, 2016, (i)
the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in all
material respects and (ii) nothing has occurred that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

Section 3.8 _Compliance with Laws_. Except (a) with respect to intellectual
property matters (which are addressed exclusively in _Section 3.14_ ), Tax
matters (which are addressed exclusively in _Section 3.11_ , and _Section
3.16_ ) and environmental matters (which are addressed exclusively in _Section
3.13_ ) and (b) for matters that would not reasonably be expected to have, in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries is conducting, and since January 1, 2014, has conducted,
its business in compliance with all applicable Laws.

Section 3.9 _Permits_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has all
governmental and non-governmental licenses and permits which are necessary
for the ownership, lease and operation of its respective properties and
assets, except licenses or permits the lack of which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

Section 3.10 _Litigation_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to any legal proceeding that the Company would be required to
disclose under Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K in a filing at the date of this
Agreement to which that Item applied, other than legal proceedings disclosed

(b) No governmental filings, authorizations, approvals or consents, or other

filed with the SEC (the "Parent 10-Q") Parent has not issued any options,
warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities which are outstanding, and
is not a party to any other agreements which require, or upon the passage of
time, the payment of money or the occurrence of any other event may require,
Parent to issue or sell any of its stock. The outstanding convertible
securities issued by Parent include $157 million principal amount of 3.25%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, which Parent can call for redemption at any
time on or after November 20, 2016, which could cause some or all of those
3.25% Notes to be converted into Parent Class A Stock at the rate of
approximately one share of Parent Class A Stock for each $23.50 principal

November 30, 2015 (the "Parent 10-K") and _Section 4.4(b)_ of the Parent

Subsidiaries of Parent. Each Subsidiary of Parent has been duly organized and
is validly existing and, to the extent the concept is applicable, in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it was formed, except
where the failure to have such power or authority would not have, or
reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. All the shares of stock or other equity interests in each of those
Subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly owned by Parent have been duly
authorized and validly issued and, with regard to stock of corporations or
other equity interests in limited liability entities, are fully paid and non-
assessable (to the extent such terms are applicable to the applicable entity
form), none of those shares or other equity interests is subject to any
preemptive rights, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has issued
any options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities, or is a party
to any other agreements which require (or upon the passage of time, the
payment of money or the occurrence of any other event may require) Parent or
any Subsidiary to issue or transfer any shares of or other equity interests in
any Subsidiary of Parent, and there are no registration covenants or transfer
or voting restrictions with respect to any shares of or other equity

conversion or exercise of convertible debt securities and stock options, in
each case, that are outstanding at the date of this Agreement). No holder of
Parent Class A Stock or other securities of Parent is entitled under Parents

and Corporate Sub is directly and wholly owned by Parent. Parent has not
issued any options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities which
are outstanding, and is not a party to any other agreements, other than this
Agreement, which require, or upon the passage of time, the payment of money
or the occurrence of any other event may require, Parent to issue or sell any
equity interest in either of LLC Sub or Corporate Sub. Each of LLC Sub and
Corporate Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of LLC Sub and Corporate
Sub has not, and on the Closing Date will not have, engaged in any activities
or incurred, directly or indirectly, any obligations or liabilities or engaged
in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any

Agreement.

Section 4.7 _Parent SEC _ _Filings_ _; Financial Statements_.

(a) Since December 1, 2014, Parent has filed with the SEC all forms, reports
and documents it has been required to file under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act.

(b) The Parent 10-K and the Parent 10-Q each contained in all material
respects all the information required to be included in it and when each was
filed with the SEC, did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required in order to make the statements made
in it, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Without limiting what is said in the preceding sentence, the
financial statements included in the Parent 10-K all were prepared, and the
financial information included in the Parent 10-Q was derived from financial
statements which were prepared, in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the
case of the Parent 10-Q, except that interim financial information does not
contain all the notes required with regard to financial statements prepared
in accordance with GAAP and is subject to normal year-end adjustments) and
present fairly the consolidated financial condition and the

 



24  consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries at
the dates, and for the periods, to which they relate. Except as described in
the notes to the financial information in the Parent 10-Q, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries (i) owns any interests in any entities whose financial
statements are not included in the consolidated financial statements of Parent
and its Subsidiaries in the Parent 10-Q and to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has made capital contributions or otherwise transferred assets
with a value totaling more than $50 million as to any single entity or more
than $100 million in total, or the operating results of which are reflected

equity basis, or (ii) is a guarantor of, or may otherwise be liable for,
indebtedness of any entity whose financial statements are not included in
the consolidated financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries in the
Parent 10-Q totaling more than $50 million as to any single entity or more
than $200 million in total.

 

(c) _Internal Controls_. Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and a system of internal control over financial reporting that meet the
requirements of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Since December 1, 2014,
Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent quarterly evaluation of internal
control over financial reporting, to Parents auditors and the audit committee

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the First Effective
Time or the time this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article

(or such equivalent organizational or governing documents of any subsidiary
if such amendment would be adverse to Parent or the Company);

 

(ii) split, combine, reclassify or subdivide any shares of stock or other
equity securities or ownership interests;

 

(iii) take any action or fail to take any action (including entering into

Date, _provided that_ Parent will not be required to comply with this _Section

Section 5.3 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement and Form S-4; Stockholders
Meeting_. __

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
will prepare a proxy statement for use in connection with the Merger
Stockholders Meeting (the "Proxy Statement") and Parent will prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the shares of
Parent Class A Stock to be issued as a result of the Initial Merger (the
"Registration Statement"), in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus. The Proxy Statement will include the Company Board Recommendation,
unless the Company Board effects a Change of Recommendation pursuant to
_Section 5.3(d)_. The Parties shall file or furnish in connection with the
Registration Statement any statement or schedule relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is required
by applicable SEC rules or requested by the staff of the SEC. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
furnish to the Party responsible for preparing the Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement, as applicable, the information required by the SEC to
be included in the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement and any such
statement or schedule. Each of the Company and Parent will use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and keep the
Registration Statement effective until the Initial Merger is effective or
until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary state securities Law or
"Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC and distributed
to the holders of Company Common Stock and made available on the internet as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Registration Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company
without providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (and good faith consideration by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, of all such comments); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement without the review or comment of
Parent in the event of a Change of Recommendation. If at any time prior to the
Closing any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document
would include in all material respects all the information required to be
included in it and would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the other Party
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information will be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law or requested by
the staff of the 

 



32  SEC, disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock. The Parties will
notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement
or for additional information and each Party will promptly supply the other
Party with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) all orders of the
SEC relating to the Registration Statement; _provided_ that no response to
any oral or written request by the SEC with respect to the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, without providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (and good faith consideration by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, of all such comments).

 

(b) The Company will take all action that is necessary in accordance with
applicable Law and its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to convene a
special meeting of its stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the "Merger Stockholders Meeting") as soon as practicable after the
Registration Statement becomes effective for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (and shall, subject to the other provisions
herein relating to the timing of such meeting, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to convene the Merger Stockholders Meeting within 35 days after
the Registration Statement becomes effective, if applicable); provided that
in no event shall the Company be required to convene the Merger Stockholders
Meeting earlier than 15 Business Days after the end of the Transaction
Solicitation Period. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company may, without the consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone
the Merger Stockholders Meeting for up to 30 days (or for such longer period
as is required by Law) (i) if as of the time for which the Merger
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), (x) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.2_ (other than receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have not
been satisfied or (y) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Merger Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if the
failure to adjourn or postpone the Merger Stockholders Meeting would
reasonably be expected to be a violation of applicable Law, (iii) for
the distribution of any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement or (iv) to solicit additional proxies if the Company reasonably
determines that it is necessary or advisable to do so in order to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Section 5.3(d)_ and Section 5.5,
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies or votes giving the Company Stockholder Approval.

 

(c) Parent will notify the Company promptly after it receives notice that the
Registration Statement has become effective or that a stop order has been
issued with regard to the Registration Statement.

(d) The Company will not take any action, other than terminating this
Agreement if it is entitled to do so under _Article VII_ , which prevents the
holders of the Company Common Stock from voting on a proposal to adopt this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Company Board may at any time withhold,
amend, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a
manner adverse

 



33  to consummation of the Mergers if the Company Board determines, in good
faith after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a
"Change of Recommendation"); _provided_ that a Change of Recommendation will
not be a basis for the Company to cancel the Merger Stockholders Meeting or
otherwise attempt to prevent the holders of the Company Common Stock from
having an opportunity to vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement, unless
such Change of Recommendation results in termination of this Agreement under
_Article VII_.

 

Section 5.4 _Regulatory Approval_. The Company and Parent will each make as
promptly as practicable all filings, if any, required under any Antitrust
Laws (including the HSR Act) with regard to the transactions that are the
subject of this Agreement. If applicable, the Company and Parent shall each
use its best efforts (including providing information to the Federal
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice) to cause (a) any waiting
periods required by Antitrust Laws (including the HSR Act) or pursuant to any
other Antitrust Laws to be terminated or to expire as promptly as practicable
and (b) any antitrust, competition or other investigations related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to conclude as promptly as
practicable, _provided that_ Parent will not be required in order to terminate
any waiting period or to prevent or resolve any objection by any Government
Entity (including the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice) to agree to dispose of, or hold separate, any
business or aspect of a business or otherwise restrict any
business activities or agree not to engage in any business activities in the
future. In the event any Government Entity challenges or threatens to
challenge the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement based upon
any Antitrust Laws or other competition Laws, the Company and Parent shall
each use its best efforts to defend against that challenge, including engaging
in litigation, through all available appeals. The Company and Parent will each
provide information and cooperate in all other respects to assist the other
of them in fulfilling the foregoing commitments.

Section 5.5 _Transaction_ _Solicitation Period_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. New York City time on October 26, 2016 (the "Transaction
Solicitation Period"), the Company and its Subsidiaries may, directly or
indirectly, including with the assistance of investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other Representatives of the Company, (i) actively seek and
take any action to initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate
(whether publicly or otherwise) any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) enter
into, participate in, maintain or continue any discussions or negotiations
relating to, or that may be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, and
in connection with such efforts, the Company may authorize its or any of
its Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees, agents or other
Representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by the Company or by any of the Subsidiaries of the Company),
directly or indirectly, to initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise
facilitate (whether publicly or privately) efforts by any Person or group
(each a "Prospective Acquirer") to decide whether to make an Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(b) During the Transaction Solicitation Period, the Company may provide non-
public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries to Prospective
Acquirers, but the Company

 



34  will not provide, or authorize anyone to provide, non-public information
about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a Prospective Acquirer unless
the Prospective Acquirer enters into a confidentiality agreement with the
Company that has substantially the same terms with respect to confidentiality
as those contained in _Section 9.2_ (an "Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement"). If the Company provides to any Prospective
Acquirer non-public information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that the Company has not provided to Parent, the Company will promptly
provide that non-public information to Parent.

(c) Without limiting what is said in  _Section 5.5(b)_ , if at any time
during the Transaction Solicitation Period, the Company Board receives a bona
fide, written Acquisition Proposal from a Prospective Acquirer, then, unless
the Company Board determines, within three days after the Company Board
receives such Acquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal does not
cause the Prospective Acquirer to be an Excluded Party, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within three days, after the Company
receives such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will inform Parent about such
Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the Prospective Acquirer and a
reasonably detailed description of its material terms.

 

Section 5.6 _No Solicitation of Offers; Notice of Proposals from Others_.

 

(a) After the end of the Transaction Solicitation Period, except as otherwise
provided in _Section 5.6(b)_ , the Company shall, except, in each case, with
respect to any Excluded Party, (i) terminate all ongoing discussions regarding
Acquisition Proposals or otherwise regarding possible Acquisition Transactions
and (ii) not authorize or permit its or any of its Subsidiaries officers,
directors, employees, agents or other Representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant acting on behalf of the Company or
by any of the Subsidiaries of the Company), directly or indirectly,
to initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate
(by making available non-public information or otherwise) any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a possible
Acquisition Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing contained herein
shall prohibit a verbal interaction initiated by a Prospective Acquirer on an
unsolicited basis so long as the Companys participation is solely to clarify
the terms and conditions of any proposal the Prospective Acquirer has made. If
the Company provides to any Prospective Acquirer non-public information about
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that the Company has not provided to
Parent, the Company will promptly provide that non-public information to
Parent.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.6(a)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives may (i) request clarifications from, provide non-
public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries (subject to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) to and engage in discussions and
negotiations with a Prospective Acquirer regarding a possible Acquisition
Transaction in response to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
offer with respect to a possible Acquisition Transaction that the Company
receives after the end of the Transaction Solicitation Period despite
complying in all material respects with _Section 5.6(a)_ , and that the
Company Board determines, in good faith after consultation with the
Companys financial advisor and outside counsel, constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to result (if consummated in accordance with its terms)
in, a transaction that would be more favorable to the holders of the Company
Common Stock than the Mergers, and (ii) execute and enter into a binding
agreement,

 



35  on such terms and conditions as the Company Board may determine (an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement"), with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board determines constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_
that any Alternative Acquisition Agreement must expressly provide that the
Company may terminate such Alternative Acquisition Agreement without cost to
the Company, and the Company will not have any obligations or be subject to
any restrictions under or as a result of the Alternate Acquisition Agreement
in the event Parent agrees, pursuant to the terms of _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ , to
amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal.

(c) If at any time after the end of the Transaction Solicitation Period, the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, a request for non-public information
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or an indication that a Prospective
Acquirer intends to make an Acquisition Proposal, as promptly as practicable,
and in any event within two Business Days, after the Company receives such
Acquisition Proposal, request for non-public information or indication of
intent to make an Acquisition Proposal, the Company will inform Parent about
such Acquisition Proposal, request or indication, including the identity of
the Prospective Acquirer from which the Acquisition Proposal, request or
indication was received, and a reasonably detailed description of its
material terms, and the Company will promptly, from time to time, provide
Parent with any additional material information the Company obtains regarding
the Acquisition Proposal, request or indication, including information about
steps that are taken in response to it or in furtherance of a possible
Acquisition Transaction.

Section 5.7 _Financing Cooperation_.

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 5.7_ , the Company will,
and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
officers and employees to, at Parents sole expense, cooperate in all
reasonable respects with the efforts of Parent to arrange any financing that
Parent expects to use after the Closing. Parent shall give the Company
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any materials that include
information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prepared in
connection with such financing, and Parent shall include in such materials
comments reasonably proposed by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required prior to consummation of the Initial Merger
to (i) pay any fees in connection with any such financing, (ii) incur any
liability of any kind (or cause their respective Representatives to incur any
liability of any kind) in connection with such financing if the Initial Merger
does not take place, (iii) enter into any binding agreement or commitment in
connection with such financing that is not conditioned on the occurrence of
the Initial Merger and does not terminate without liability to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries upon termination of this Agreement, or (iv) take any
action that would (A) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Initial Merger, (B) cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached, (C) cause any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
incur any personal liability, (D) conflict with the charter, the bylaws (or
similar organizational documents) of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
of the Company or any Laws, (E) result in the contravention of, or that could
reasonably be expected to result prior to the Initial Merger in a violation or
breach of, or a default under, any Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or (F)

 



36  require the Company, prior to the Initial Merger, to provide access to or
disclose information that the Company determines would jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Parent shall promptly following delivery of invoices reimburse the Company
for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives in connection with any cooperation contemplated by
this _Section 5.7_. The Company (until consummation of the Initial Merger),
its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (collectively, the
"Financing Indemnitees") shall be indemnified and held harmless by Parent and
Merger Subs, jointly and severally, for and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including advancing attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation), interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred, directly or indirectly, by the Financing Indemnitees in
connection with the arrangement of any financing or any information utilized
in connection therewith or the Companys cooperation with respect thereto.
This _Section 5.7(b)_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the
Closing and any termination of this Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and
may be enforced by, the Financing Indemnitees and their respective
heirs, executors, estates, personal representatives, successors and assigns,
and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent. All non-public
or other confidential information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Merger Subs or their Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ or otherwise shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) Each of Parent and each of the Merger Subs acknowledges and agrees that
the obtainment of financing is not a condition to the Closing.

Section 5.8 _Return of Materials Subject to Confidentiality Agreements_. As
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, to the extent
permitted by applicable confidentiality agreements, the Company will request
that any Person that holds confidential information provided by or on behalf
of the Company during the two years prior to the date of this Agreement under
a confidentiality agreement entered into in connection with a possible
acquisition of the Company or a significant portion of its or any of its
material Subsidiaries assets (other than through sales in the ordinary course
of business) promptly return to the Company or destroy such confidential
information.

Section 5.9 _Communications to Company Employees_. The Company shall provide
Parent reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the form of any written
statements to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries informing them
about the Mergers prior to any distribution of such statements. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.9_ does not apply to matters contemplated
by _Section 9.3_.

Section 5.10 _Defense_ _Against_ _Litigation_. The Company shall promptly
advise Parent of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the
Company or any of its directors (in their capacity as such) by any holder of
Company Common Stock (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company)
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company 

 



37  shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the
defense or settlement of any such litigation and shall consider Parents views
with respect to such litigation or settlement. Parent shall promptly advise
the Company of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against Parent,
its Affiliates or any of its directors (in their capacity as such) in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.11 _Efforts of Parent and Merger Subs to Fulfill_ _Conditions_.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.5_ and _Section 5.6_ ), Parent and each of the Merger Subs each will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause all the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_
and _Section 9.17_  (to the extent applicable to Parent and Merger Subs) and
Section 6.2 to be fulfilled as promptly as practicable after the end of the
Transaction Solicitation Period and consummate the Mergers. Without limiting
what is said in the first sentence of this _Section 5.11_ , neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries (including either Merger Sub) will do anything
that would prevent the Mergers from qualifying as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code (if the Merger Consideration includes shares of
Parent Class A Stock).

Section 5.12 _Efforts of the Company to Fulfill Conditions_. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section 5.5_ and _Section
5.6_ ), the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause all the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and  _Section 9.17_ (to the extent
applicable to the Company) and _Section 6.3_ to be fulfilled as promptly as
practicable after the end of the Transaction Solicitation Period and
consummate the Mergers. Without limiting what is said in the first sentence
of this _Section 5.12_ , neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will
do anything that would prevent the Mergers from qualifying as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code (if the
Merger Consideration includes shares of Parent Class A Stock).

ARTICLE VII __

 

 _TERMINATION_

 

Section 7.1 _Right to Terminate_. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the First Effective Time (whether or not the Companys
stockholders have adopted this Agreement):

(a) By mutual written consent of the Company and Parent.

 

(b) By either the Company or Parent if the Closing Date does not occur on or
before March 22, 2017 (the "Outside Date");  _provided_ , _however_ , __ that
__ if any condition set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.1(c)_ shall
not have been satisfied or duly waived by all Parties

 



40  entitled to the benefit of such condition by the fifth Business Day prior to
the Outside Date, the Company may, by written notice to Parent, extend the
Outside Date by two additional months until May 22, 2017, which date shall
thereafter be considered the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that if on
May 22, 2017, any condition set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ or, solely to the
extent pertaining to Antitrust Laws, _Section 6.1(c)_ , shall not have been
satisfied or duly waived by all Parties entitled to the benefit of such
condition, the Company may, by written notice to Parent, extend the Outside
Date by an additional ten months until March 22, 2018;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision
under this Agreement has been the primary cause of the failure of the Closing
to occur prior to the Outside Date.

(c) By either the Company or Parent if any order of any Governmental Entity
having competent jurisdiction is entered permanently enjoining the Company,
Parent or Merger Subs from consummating the Mergers and such order has become
final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to
any Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement was the primary
cause of the imposition of any such order or the failure of such order to be
resisted, resolved or lifted, as applicable.

(d) By the Company if:

 

 _(_ i) There exists a breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or
either Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the condition set
forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ is not capable of being satisfied by the Outside
Date, and such breach is incapable of being cured in a manner to satisfy such
condition by the Outside Date or is not cured by Parent in a manner
sufficient to satisfy such condition within 45 Business Days after Parent
receives written notice of such breach from the Company (which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the nature of such breach and the
Companys intention to terminate this Agreement if such breach is not cured);
_provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if, at the time of such
termination, the Company is in breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that would result in a failure of any condition set
forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_.

 

(ii) Prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (A) the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) at least three Business Days prior to the
termination of this Agreement, the Company gives Parent and the Merger Subs a
notice (a "Superior Proposal Termination Notice") (x) including a copy of an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement or a final draft of such an agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (y) stating what the Company Board has
determined in good faith to be the value per share of Company Common Stock of
the consideration the Companys stockholders would receive as a result of the
Superior Proposal and (z) stating that unless Parent agrees to amend the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would
cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, this Agreement will terminate on a
date set forth in the Superior Proposal Termination Notice (which will be no
earlier than the day after the expiration of the three Business Day notice
period (or two

 



41  Business Day notice period for a new Superior Proposal Termination Notice,
if applicable)), (C) during such three Business Day period (or such two
Business Day period for a new Superior Proposal), the Company negotiates with
Parent in good faith (if Parent desires to negotiate) regarding changes to the
terms and conditions in this Agreement that would cause the transaction that
is the subject of this Agreement to be at least as favorable to the holders
of the Company Common Stock as the Acquisition Proposal it has determined to
be a Superior Proposal (including describing to Parent how the Company Board
values the components of the Acquisition Proposal it has
determined constitutes a Superior Proposal, how the Company Board values the
components of the Merger Consideration, and all other respects in which the
Company Board believes the Acquisition Proposal is or may be more favorable to
the holders of the Company Common Stock than this Agreement), (D) Parent
fails to agree by the termination date set forth in the Superior Proposal
Termination Notice to amend this Agreement so that, in the good faith judgment
of the Company Board, based on the factors described to Parent, the
transaction that is the subject of this Agreement as amended would be at least
as favorable to the holders of the Company Common Stock as the Acquisition
Proposal (and therefore, the Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a
Superior Proposal), and (E) concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement, the Company pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent $11,250,000 (the
"Excluded Party Termination Fee") if the Superior Proposal was received by
the Company from an Excluded Party, or $22,500,000 (the "Termination Fee") if
the Superior Proposal was not received from an Excluded Party; _provided_ that
in the event of any material amendment to such Acquisition Proposal that
would cause the Company Board to determine that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal despite the amendments to this Agreement, if any, that had
been agreed to by Parent, the Company shall be required (but only on
two additional occasions) to deliver a new Superior Proposal Termination
Notice to Parent and the Merger Subs ( _provided_ that any new Superior
Proposal Termination Notice need only be given at least two Business Days
prior to the termination of this Agreement), which new Superior Proposal
Termination Notice shall become the operative Superior Proposal Termination
Notice for purposes of this Section 7.1(d)(ii). A Superior Proposal
Termination Notice (including a new Superior Proposal Termination Notice) may
be revoked by the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement.

(iii) All of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ have
been satisfied or waived, and Parent and Corporate Sub have failed to
consummate the Initial Merger by the time the Closing should have occurred
pursuant to _Section 1.2_. 

(e) By Parent if:

 

(i) There exists a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section
6.3(a) is not capable of being satisfied by the Outside Date, and such breach
is incapable of being cured in a manner sufficient to satisfy such condition
by the Outside Date or is not cured by the Company in a manner to satisfy
such condition within 45 Business Days after the Company receives written
notice of such breach from Parent (which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the nature of such breach and Parents intention to terminate this
Agreement if such breach is not cured); _provided_ that Parent shall not have
the right to

 



42  terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)(i)_ if, at the
time of such termination, Parent is in breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that would result in a failure of any condition set
forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_.

(ii) Prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (w) the
Company Board effects a Change of Recommendation (other than in connection
with the exercise of the Companys rights pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii))_ ,
(x) a third party makes a public statement that the Company Board intends to
effect a Change of Recommendation (other than in connection with the exercise
of the Companys rights pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii))_ and the Company does
not issue and file with the SEC a public statement denying that that the
Company Board intends to effect a Change of Recommendation within three
Business Days following a request by Parent to do so, (y) somebody other than
Parent commences a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock and the Company Board, or a committee of the
Company Board, recommends that the Companys stockholders tender all or a
portion of their Company Common Stock in response to such tender offer or
exchange offer, or somebody other than Parent announces an intention to
commence a tender offer or an exchange offer for 15% or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock and states that the Company Board intends to
recommend that the Companys stockholders tender all or a portion of their
Company Common Stock in response to such tender offer or exchange offer and
the Company does not within 10 Business Days issue and file with the SEC a
public statement denying that that is the case or (z) somebody other than
Parent commences a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock and the Company does not within 10 Business
Days after the tender offer or exchange offer is commenced file with the SEC
a Statement on Schedule 14D-9 which includes a recommendation that holders of
Company Common Stock not tender their Company Common Stock in response to the
tender offer or exchange offer. If Parent terminates this Agreement as
permitted by this  _Section 7.1(e)(ii)_ , within five Business Days after
this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay Parent the Termination Fee,
unless such termination was in connection with the commencement of a tender
offer or exchange offer by an Excluded Party, in which case the Company shall
be required to pay Parent within five Business Days after this Agreement is
terminated, the Excluded Party Termination Fee rather than the Termination
Fee.

 

Section 7.2 _ _ _Manner of Terminating Agreement_. If at any time the Company
or Parent has the unilateral right under _Section 7.1_ to terminate this
Agreement, except as specifically provided in _Section 7.1_ , such Party may
terminate this Agreement by a notice to the other Party that it is terminating
this Agreement, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made and describing the basis therefor in reasonable detail,
and, with regard to a termination by the Company under _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ ,
the Companys making, or causing to be made, the payment described in
that Section.

Section 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ , following such termination, this
Agreement shall be null and void and no Party will have any further rights or
obligations hereunder; _provided_ that the provisions of _Section 5.7(b)_ ,
this _Article VII,_ _Article IX_  and the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.
If this Agreement is

 



43  terminated (x) in a manner pursuant to which the Excluded Party Termination
Fee or the Termination Fee is payable then the payment of such amount shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Subs hereunder or (y) in a
manner not contemplated in the preceding clause (x), then nothing shall
relieve either party of liability for any breach of this Agreement which
occurs before this Agreement is terminated.

 

ARTICLE VIII __

 

 _OTHER AGREEMENTS_

 

Section 8.1 _Indemnification_ _and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Subs agree that all rights of indemnification,
advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitation of liabilities existing
in favor of the current or former directors, officers and employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and each such Person who served at the request of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee,
partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws or similar organizational documents of any
Subsidiary of the Company or under any indemnification, employment or other
similar agreements between any Indemnified Party and the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the First Effective Time,
shall survive the Mergers and continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms. Parent hereby guaranties the indemnification and
expense advancement obligations of the Final Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries under those provisions of the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws. Parent will, or will cause the Final
Surviving Entity to, maintain in effect for not less than six years after the
First Effective Time, with respect to occurrences prior to the First Effective
Time, the Companys policies of directors and officers liability insurance
which are in effect on the date of this Agreement and are set forth on
_Section 8.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (notwithstanding any provisions
of those policies that they will terminate as a result of the Mergers), or
substantially similar insurance, to the extent that insurance is available at
an annual cost not exceeding 300% of the annual cost of the policies of
directors and officers liability insurance which are in effect at the date of
this Agreement, and to the extent that insurance is not available at an
annual cost that will not exceed that amount, Parent will, or will cause the
Final Surviving Entity to, maintain in effect for that period the maximum
amount of such insurance coverage that can be obtained for that maximum
annual cost.

(b) Each of Parent, the Final Surviving Entity and the Indemnified Parties
shall cooperate in the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section 8.1_ and shall
provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 8.1_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor the Final Surviving Entity shall (and Parent
shall cause the Final Surviving Entity not to) settle or compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect 

 



44  to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation of an Indemnified
Party for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section 8.1_ unless
such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include an
admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party or such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination.

(c) In the event that Parent or the Final Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, or if Parent
dissolves the Final Surviving Entity, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Final Surviving Entity assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 8.1_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 8.1_ shall (i) survive the consummation
of the Mergers, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and
Representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by Contract or otherwise. From and after the First Effective Time, the
provisions of this _Section 8.1_ may not be amended in any manner adverse to
any Indemnified Party without his or her consent.

Section 8.2 _Employee Benefits Matters_. 

(a) Parent shall cause the Final Surviving Entity to honor and fulfill all
written employment agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party at the date of this Agreement (or otherwise becomes a party on or
after the date of this Agreement without breach of the terms of this
Agreement) and all of the employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the date of this Agreement (or
otherwise maintained or sponsored on or after the date of this Agreement
without breach of the terms of this Agreement) for the benefit of any
employees or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, the Material Employment Agreements and
Material Benefit Plans) (collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans") in effect
as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time. Effective as
of the First Effective Time and for a period of no less than one year
thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Final Surviving Entity
to provide, to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues
to be employed by the Parent or the Final Surviving Entity or any Subsidiary
thereof (collectively, the "Continuing Employees"), (i) compensation
(including, without limitation, cash incentive compensation opportunities and
any equity-based compensation (other than pursuant to the LTI Plans)), that is
not less favorable than the compensation they were receiving as employees of
the Company immediately before the First Effective Time (excluding, for
purposes of compensation in respect of periods on or after January 1, 2017,
cash incentive compensation opportunities under the 2016 WCI Management
Incentive Compensation Plan), and (ii) employee benefits that (A) if the
First Effective Time is on or before December 31, 2016, are, (x) on and before
December 31, 2016, not less favorable than the employee benefits they were
receiving as employees of the Company

 



45  immediately before the First Effective Time, and (y) beginning January 1,
2017, the same as those provided to employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries in
South Florida who are performing similar functions, and (B) if the First
Effective Time is on or after January 1, 2017, are, from the First Effective
time until December 31, 2017, at the election of Parent, either (x) the same
as those being provided by the Company immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, or (y) the same as those provided by Parent and its
Subsidiaries to their similarly-situated employees during such period (
_provided_ that, in all cases, from the First Effective Time through December
31, 2017, the vacation and other paid time off policies applicable to the
Continuing Employees (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the timing of accrual
thereunder) shall be no less favorable than those applicable to the Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the First Effective Time). Effective as of the
First Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Final Surviving Entity to provide, that periods of employment with the Company
(including any current or former Affiliate of the Company or any predecessor
of the Company) shall be taken into account for all purposes under all
employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
("Parent Benefit Plans") for the benefit of the Continuing Employees,
including without limitation vacation or other paid-time-off plans or
arrangements, 401(k), pension or other retirement plans and any severance or
health or welfare plans (other than for purposes of determining any accrued
benefit under any defined benefit pension plan or as would result in a
duplication of benefits).

(b) Effective as of the First Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Final Surviving Entity to, (i) ensure that no eligibility
waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition
limitations or exclusions shall apply with respect to the Continuing
Employees under the applicable Parent Benefit Plan (except to the extent
applicable under Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the First
Effective Time), (ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability
requirements with respect to such Continuing Employees to the extent such
evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the Continuing
Employees under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, and (iii) credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible
payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments paid by such employee under the
Company Benefit Plans prior to the First Effective Time during the year in
which the Mergers occur for the purpose of determining the extent to which
any such employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she
has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any Parent Benefit Plan for such
year. The Mergers shall not affect any Continuing Employees accrual of, or
right to use, in accordance with Company policy as in effect immediately prior
to the First Effective Time, any personal, sick, vacation or other paid-time-
off accrued but unused by such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the First Effective Time, except to the extent of accruals relating to
periods after December 31, 2017 (which will be subject to Parents policies
and practices regarding personal, sick, vacation and other paid-time-off).

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with each other and with any "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code) to reduce the amount of any "parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), including by
reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, payable to such disqualified
individual to the extent that such parachute payments could otherwise be
subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code so that such
excise tax will not apply or will be reduced; provided, however, that in no
event shall the Company or Parent

 



46  require that any disqualified individual waive any right to any payment or
benefit (or waive any acceleration of any payment of benefit) pursuant to any
plan or agreement covering such disqualified individual as of the date
hereof.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Final Surviving
Entity or any other Subsidiary of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict
in any way the rights of Parent, the Final Surviving Entity or any other
Subsidiary of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time,
with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a
written agreement between Parent, the Final Surviving Entity, the Company or
any Subsidiary of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit
or other applicable plan or program of Parent covering such Continuing
Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this _Section 8.2_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an
amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit
Plan, or (ii) create any third party rights in any current or former
service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof).

ARTICLE IX __

 

 _GENERAL_

Section 9.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the
Company, Parent and Merger Subs will each pay their own expenses in connection
with the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, including legal
fees and disbursements, whether or not the Mergers are consummated.

Section 9.2 _Access to Properties, Books and Records_. Subject to  _Section
5.7(b)_ , from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the First
Effective Time or the time this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Article VII_ , the Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
give Representatives of Parent and the Merger Subs, or of any potential
lenders or other sources of financing to Parent or the Merger Subs for
financing to be used by Parent and its Subsidiaries after the Mergers, full
access during normal business hours to all of their respective properties,
books and records and to personnel who are knowledgeable about the various
aspects of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide access to, or
cause its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or disclose any information or
documents which would (in the reasonable judgment of the Company) be
reasonably likely to (a) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or
other privilege held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) violate
any applicable Laws (and the Company shall be permitted to implement customary
"clean-room" or other similar arrangements if the Company reasonably
determines, upon advice of outside counsel, that such arrangements are
necessary to comply with applicable Law), (c) unreasonably disrupt the
businesses and operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (d)
breach any agreement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any Third
Party or (e) in the reasonable judgment of the Company, result in the
disclosure of trade secrets of a Third Party or violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations to a Third Party with respect to confidentiality;
_provided_ that the Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
consent of the Third Parties to the

 



47  inspection or disclosure. Until the Closing, Parent and the Merger Subs each
will, and will cause their Representatives to, hold all information they
receive as a result of their access to the properties, books, records and
personnel of the Company or its subsidiaries in confidence, except to the
extent that information (a) is or becomes available to the public (other than
through a breach of this Agreement), (b) becomes available to Parent or the
Merger Subs from a Third Party that is not under an obligation to the Company,
or to a subsidiary of the Company, to keep the information confidential, (c)
was known to Parent or its Affiliates (which includes the Merger Subs) before
it was made available to Parent or the Merger Subs or their Representatives by
the Company or a subsidiary, (d) otherwise is independently developed by
Parent or Merger Subs or their Affiliates, (e) Parent reasonably believes is
required to be included in the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or
another document filed with or furnished to the SEC, or (f) Parent reasonably
determines, based on advice of legal counsel, that Parent is required
to disclose in response to legal process or an order of a court or other
Governmental Entity. If this Agreement is terminated before the First
Effective Time, Parent and the Merger Subs each will, at the request of the
Company, deliver to the Company all documents and other material obtained by
Parent or either of the Merger Subs from the Company or a subsidiary in
connection with the transactions which are the subject of this Agreement or
evidence that that material has been destroyed by Parent or the Merger Subs.

Section 9.3 _Press Releases_. The Company and Parent will consult with each
other before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement, the Mergers and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, but nothing in this _Section 9.3_ will prevent
any Party or any Affiliate of any Party from making any statement or
announcement when and as required by Law or by the rules of any securities
exchange or securities quotation or trading system on which securities of that
Party or an Affiliate are listed, quoted or traded. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in connection with any action by the Company or the Company Board
permitted by _Section 5.3(d)_ or Section 5.5, the Company shall not be
required to consult with Parent or the Merge Subs prior to issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public announcements with respect to
such actions and the reasons for such actions.

Section 9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the other exhibits and
schedules to this Agreement), the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents
to be delivered in accordance with this Agreement contain the entire
agreement among the Company, Parent and Merger Subs relating to the
transactions which are the subject of this Agreement and those other
documents, all prior negotiations, understandings and agreements between the
Company and either Parent or Merger Subs are superseded by this Agreement and
those other documents, and each Party acknowledges and agrees that it has not
relied upon any statements, representations, warranties, understandings or
agreements concerning or relating to the transactions that are the subject of
this Agreement or those other documents other than those expressly set forth
in this Agreement or those other documents.

 

Section 9.5 _Benefit of Agreement_. This Agreement is not intended to be for
the benefit of, or to give any rights to, anybody other than the Parties,
their respective successors and any permitted assigns, except (a) as stated in
_Section 8.1_ and, from and after the Closing, the rights of holders of
Company Common Stock and the holders of other securities of the Company 

 



48  to receive the consideration pursuant to the Mergers as set forth in
_Article I_ and _Article II_ and (b) any rights holders of Company Common
Stock and the holders of other securities of the Company may have to seek
damages (which, to the extent available at law, may include loss of the
economic benefits they were to receive under this Agreement) or any other
relief (including equitable relief) to which they are entitled, and any
rights of the Company to seek such damages or other relief on their behalf.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties may intend that some of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement represent an allocation
among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters rather than
assurances of the existence of particular facts or conditions. Accordingly, no
Persons other than the Parties may assert any claim based upon the fact that
actual facts or conditions are not as stated in particular representations
and warranties.

Section 9.6 _Effect of Disclosures_. Any information disclosed by the
Company or Parent in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter, respectively, will be treated as having been disclosed in connection
with each representation and warranty made by such Party in this Agreement,
but shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of materiality of such
item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality for any purpose
whatsoever. Any such information relating to any possible breach or violation
of any Contract or Law shall not be construed as an admission or indication
with respect to any third party that any such breach or violation exists or
has actually occurred.

 

Section 9.7 _Interpretation; Headings; Captions; Mutual Drafting_.

 

(a) In this Agreement, unless otherwise specified, the following rules of

versa; (iv) whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this
Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms,
and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and

limitation; (vi) references to months are to calendar months; (vii) the words
"hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in
this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement; (viii) references to "$" or "dollars" refer to
the currency of the United States; (ix) any dollar or percentage thresholds
set forth herein shall not be used as a benchmark for the determination of
what is or is not "material" or a "Material Adverse Effect" under this

Agreement and in each Exhibit, Annex and Schedule to this Agreement,
regardless of whether it appears before or after the place where it is
defined; (xi) when used herein, the word "extent" and the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such word or phrase shall not simply mean "if"; (xii) the word "if" and other
words of similar import when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the phrase "and only if"; (xiii) any reference to "days" means
calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified; and (xiv) the term

term "or" will mean "or." The table of contents, headings and captions of the
articles and sections of this Agreement are for convenience only, and do not
affect the meaning or

 



49  interpretation of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall

this Agreement, and in the event of an ambiguity or if a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted
by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of
this Agreement.

Section 9.8 _Assignments_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of any Party hereunder, may be assigned (by
operation of law of otherwise), except that either Merger Sub may assign its
rights under this Agreement to an entity that is a directly wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent and, as to an assignment by LLC Sub, which entity is
treated as disregarded as separate from Parent for U.S. federal income tax
purposes ( _provided_ that such assignment by either of the Merger Subs shall
not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Mergers, or otherwise materially adversely
affect the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement). No
assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 9.9 _Notices and Other Communications_. Any notice or other

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by,
and construed under, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within the State, without
regard to conflicts of laws principles that would apply the Laws of any other
jurisdictions.

 

Section 9.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The Company, Parent and each Merger
Sub agrees that any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement shall be heard and
determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware _(_ or, if the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware
(Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the
matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively
in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of
the United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware), and any
appellate court

 



51  from any thereof, and each of them irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives the defense of an inconvenient forum and all other
defenses to venue in any such court in any such action or proceeding. The
consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section 9.11_ shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties.
The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any
Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal
from, a final trial court judgment. The Parties agree that process in any such
action or proceeding may be served by registered mail or in any other manner
permitted by the rules of the court in which the action or proceeding is
brought.

Section 9.12 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge
that money damages would not be an adequate remedy if the Company, Parent or
Merger Subs failed to perform in any material respect any of its obligations
under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, and accordingly they
agree that in addition to any other remedy to which a Party may be entitled
at law or in equity, any Party will be entitled to obtain an order compelling
specific performance of another Partys obligations under this Agreement,
without any requirement that it post a bond, and the Parties agree that if
any proceeding is brought in equity to compel performance of any provision of
this Agreement, no Party will raise the defense that there is an adequate
remedy at law. Except as otherwise provided herein, no remedy will be
exclusive of any other remedy to which a Party may be entitled hereunder, or
by law or equity, and the remedies available to a Party will be cumulative.

 

Section 9.13 _Attorney Conflicts and Attorney Client Privilege_. Parent, the
Company, and Merger Subs agree that, although Latham and Watkins LLP ("Latham and
Watkins") has rendered, and may continue to render, legal services to the
Company prior to the Closing, including legal services relating to the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, Latham and Watkins will
have the right, after the Closing, to render legal services to any
stockholder, director or employee of the Company, including with regard to any
disputes relating to this Agreement or the transactions that are
contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent, the Company and each of the
Merger Subs each waives any right it might have to seek to disqualify Latham and
Watkins from rendering legal services to any stockholder, director or employee
of the Company on the basis of a conflict of interest because Latham and
Watkins rendered legal services to the Company, because of information of
which Latham and Watkins may have become aware while rendering legal services to
the Company, or for any other reason.

 

Section 9.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY WAY OF COUNTERCLAIM AND ANY ACTION OR

 



52  PROCEEDING RELATING TO THE NEGOTIATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (d) SUCH PARTY IS AWARE THAT OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section 9.14_.

 

Section 9.15 _Amendments_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf of
their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the First Effective
Time, whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval (a) there shall be no
amendment that decreases the Merger Consideration and there shall be no
amendment to _Section 8.1_ , and (b) no amendment that requires further
approval by the Company stockholders may be made without such
Company stockholder approval. This Agreement may be amended only by a
document in writing signed by each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subs.

 

Section 9.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, some of which may be signed by fewer than all the Parties or
may contain facsimile copies of pages signed by some of the Parties. Each of
those counterparts will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement,
but all of them together will constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery
of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
or other electronic transmission, including by e-mail attachment, shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section 9.17 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause Latham and Watkins
LLP to provide the Company Tax Opinion. None of the Parties will take or
knowingly fail to take (or cause any other person to take or knowingly fail to
take) any action, which action or failure to act could reasonably be expected
to prevent or impede the ability of Latham and Watkins LLP to deliver the
Company Tax Opinion.

(b) The Parties to this Agreement intend that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) the Initial Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together,
constitute an integrated plan described in Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321
(the "Integrated Transaction"), (ii) the Integrated Transaction will qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and each of Parent and the
Company will be a "party to a reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under it, (iii)
this Agreement will constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g), and (iv) the Fractional Share
Consideration will be treated consistent with the principles set forth in
Rev.Rul. 66-365, 1966-2 C.B. 116 (the treatment described in clauses (i)
through (iv) being, collectively,

 



53  the "Intended Tax Treatment"), _provided_ that if the Merger Consideration
is paid entirely as Cash Consideration, the "Intended Tax Treatment" will be
treatment of the Initial Merger as a taxable purchase of stock of the
Company. After the Closing, unless the Merger Consideration is being paid
entirely as Cash Consideration, none of the Parties shall take any action, or
knowingly fail to take any action, which action or failure to act could
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the transactions that are the
subject of this Agreement from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.
Unless otherwise required by Law or the Merger Consideration is being paid
entirely as Cash Consideration, the Parties will in all Tax Returns report the
Mergers in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and no Party
will take a position inconsistent with that treatment, unless required to do
otherwise pursuant to a final determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of
the Code (or pursuant to any similar provision of applicable state, local or
foreign Law).

 

(c) Parent and the Company shall each use their best efforts to deliver to
Latham and Watkins LLP (i) at any time upon the request of Latham and Watkins LLP
in connection with any tax opinions required to be issued in connection with
the Proxy Statement and (ii) again prior to the Closing, a certificate, dated
as of the necessary date for the Proxy Statement or as of the Closing, as
applicable, signed by an executive officer of Parent or the Company, as
applicable, certifying as to representations substantially in the form set
forth on _Exhibit B_ (in the case of Parent) and _Exhibit C_ (in the case of
the Company).

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of this
_Section 9.17_ shall not be applicable following the delivery of a Cash
Election Notice by Parent pursuant to the terms hereof.

Section 9.18 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement
and any certificate delivered pursuant hereto by any Person shall terminate at
the First Effective Time, except that this _Section 9.18_ shall not limit any
covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates
performance in whole or in part after the First Effective Time, including
those contained in _Article I_ , _Article II_ , this  _Article IX_ , _Section
5.8_ , _Section 8.1_ , _Section 8.2_ and _Section 9.17_.

Section 9.19 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the First Effective
Time, the Parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of this Agreement by
the Company stockholders, no extension or waiver that, by Law, requires
further approval by such Company stockholders may be made without such Company
stockholder approval. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed by such Party. The failure or delay of any Party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under
this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of any rights hereunder.

 



54 Section 9.20 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
negotiate in good faith to replace such void or unenforceable provision of
this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

 

Section 9.21 _Obligations of Parent_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of Parent to take any action (including Merger Subs, the Initial
Surviving Entity and the Final Surviving Entity), such requirement shall be
