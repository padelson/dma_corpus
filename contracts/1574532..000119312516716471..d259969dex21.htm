representations and warranties included in this Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) were made by the parties to the Merger Agreement for their respective contractual benefit. These representations and warranties are made
as of specific dates, only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and for the benefit of the parties thereto. These representations and warranties are subject to important exceptions and limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being
qualified by confidential disclosures, made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties rather than establishing these matters as facts, and were made subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may differ from the
standard generally applicable under federal securities laws. The Merger Agreement is filed with this report only to provide investors with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding the
Company or its business. Information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed, and may continue to change, since the date of the Merger Agreement, and such subsequent information may or may not be fully
reflected in the Company&#146;s public reports. The information in the Merger Agreement should be considered together with the Company&#146;s public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The schedules to the Merger Agreement
have been omitted. The Company agrees to furnish supplementally a copy of any omitted schedule to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission upon request. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P><center>
