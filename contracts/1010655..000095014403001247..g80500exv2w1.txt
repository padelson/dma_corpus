INC.  a Florida corporation (the "Company")  1000 Business Center Drive 
Lake Mary, Florida 32746    SunGard Data Systems Inc.  a Delaware
corporation ("Parent")  1285 Drummers Lane, Suite 300  Wayne, Pennsylvania
19087    Lake Acquisition Corp. Inc.  a Florida corporation ("Acquisition
Sub")  1285 Drummers Lane, Suite 300  Wayne, Pennsylvania 19087   DATE:
FEBRUARY 4, 2003   BACKGROUND   A. The respective boards of directors of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have each determined that it is
advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders for
Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and provisions of and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.   B. It is proposed that
Acquisition Sub make a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Company
(the "Company Common Stock") for $7.00 per share (such amount, or any greater
per share amount paid pursuant to the Offer, subject to Section 1.1(e), being
the "Per Share Amount"), upon the terms and provisions of and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.   C. In furtherance of the acquisition of the
Company by Parent, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition
Sub and the Company have each approved a merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition
Sub with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation,
upon the terms and provisions of and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.   D. By resolutions duly adopted, the board of directors of
the Company has, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions hereof:
(i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders, among others; and (ii)
resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company accept the Offer
and tender their shares pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement.  
E. In order to induce Parent and Acquisition Sub to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, concurrently with the
execution and   delivery of this Agreement certain of the shareholders,
executive officers and directors of the Company set forth on Exhibit B hereto
are executing one or more tender and voting agreements in favor of Parent and
Acquisition Sub (collectively, the "Tender and Voting Agreement").   F.
Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in Exhibit A
hereto.   INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, in consideration of the
mutual agreements contained herein and subject to the satisfaction of the
terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:   SECTION 1: THE OFFER   1.1 CONDUCT OF THE OFFER.   (a)
Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8 hereof and that none of the events or circumstances set forth
in Annex I shall have occurred or exist (excluding the events or
circumstances set forth in paragraphs "(a)" and "(d)" in Annex I),
as promptly as practicable (and in any event not later than ten (10) business
days after the date of this Agreement, provided that the Company has, within
a reasonable time prior theretofore, provided Parent with the information
about the Company required to be included in the Offer Statement (defined
below)), Acquisition Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) the Offer.   (b) Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall accept for
payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as soon as it is permitted to do so under applicable
Law and shall pay for such shares promptly thereafter (and in any event in
compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act). The obligation of
Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to (i) the
condition that there shall be validly tendered and not withdrawn a number of
shares of Company Common Stock that (including the shares tendered under the
Tender and Voting Agreement) immediately prior to the acceptance for payment
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer ("Parent-Owned
Shares"), represents at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Number of
Company Shares (the "Minimum Condition") and (ii) the other conditions set
forth in Annex I. Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right at its
sole discretion to increase the initial Per Share Amount, to waive (in whole
or in part) any of the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex I or to
make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided
that without the prior written consent of the Company: (i) the Minimum
Condition may not be amended or waived; (ii) no change may be made that
changes the form of consideration to be paid, reduces the Per Share Amount or
changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the Offer, or
that imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the Minimum Condition and
the conditions set forth in Annex 1; (iii) except as provided in Section
1.1(c), no change may be made that extends the expiration date of the Offer
beyond the initial expiration date of the Offer, and (iv) no change may be
made that amends any other terms of the Offer in a manner adverse to the
holders of the Company Common Stock.   (c) The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire twenty (20) business days following the date of the
commencement thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, but subject to the parties\' respective termination rights
under    2  Section 8.1, (i) if, at any then-scheduled expiration date,
any of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived,
Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to extend the Offer for such amount of time
as is reasonably necessary to cause such conditions to the Offer to be
satisfied; (ii) Acquisition Sub may, without the consent of the Company or
any other Person (A) extend the Offer (one (1) or more times) for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
applicable to the Offer and (B) if the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer (other than shares tendered by guaranteed delivery
where actual delivery has not occurred) as of the scheduled or extended
expiration date of the Offer, plus (2) the number of Parent-Owned Shares as
of such date, represents more than a majority of the Fully Diluted Number of
Company Shares but less than 80% of the Fully Diluted Number of Company
Shares as of such date (or, if greater, the number and type of shares of
Company Common Stock, including shares of Company Common Stock Entitled to
Vote and shares of Company Common Stock not Entitled to Vote, required to
satisfy the conditions of Section 607.1104(1)(a) of the FBCA), extend the
Offer (one (1) or more times) for an aggregate additional period of not more
than twenty (20) business days; (iii) Acquisition Sub may, without
the consent of the Company or any other Person, elect to provide for a
subsequent offering period (and one (1) or more extensions thereof) pursuant
to, and in accordance with the terms of, Rule 14d under the Exchange Act; and
(iv) if, at any then-scheduled expiration date any of the conditions to the
Offer have not been satisfied or waived, Acquisition Sub shall, if the
Company so requests in writing, extend the Offer for ten (10) business days;
provided, however, that Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the
expiration date more than one (1) time pursuant to this clause (iv).   (d)
On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
(i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to
the Offer which will contain or incorporate by reference the offer to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Offer
Statement") and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the
Offer Statement and related documents to be disseminated to holders of shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that they shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto (which together constitute the "Offer Documents") to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees to use all reasonable efforts
to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer Documents or the Offer, to correct promptly any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as supplemented
or amended to correct such information to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company
shall promptly furnish to Parent and Acquisition Sub all information
concerning the Acquired Companies and the Company\'s shareholders that may be
required or reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated
by this Section 1.1(d). The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents (including any
amendment thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and
Acquisition Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel with
any comments Parent, Acquisition Sub or their counsel may receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt
of such comments.     3    (e) If, between the date of this Agreement
and the date on which any particular share of Company Common Stock is
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason
of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Per Share Amount
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change or transaction.  
1.2 COMPANY ACTIONS.   (a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the
Offer and represents that its board of directors, at a meeting duly called
and held, has by the unanimous vote of all directors of the Company (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its shareholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
in accordance with the requirements of the Florida Business Corporation Act
("FBCA"), (iii) declared that this Agreement is advisable, (iv) resolved to
recommend that shareholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement
(the recommendation of the Company\'s board of directors that the
shareholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement being
referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation"), (v) approved the Tender
and Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (vi) adopted
a resolution that Acquisition Sub shall have full voting rights with respect
to shares of Company Common Stock owned by the shareholders who execute the
Tender and Voting Agreement, including Tyler Technologies, Inc. ("Tyler"),
that are acquired by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer and that the proxy
agents named pursuant to the Tender and Voting Agreement shall have full
voting rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock owned by
the shareholders who execute the Tender and Voting Agreement, including
Tyler, for which a proxy has been given pursuant to the Tender and Voting
Agreement, (vii) to the extent necessary, adopted a resolution having the
effect of causing the Company, the Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby not to be subject to any
state takeover law or similar Law, including, without limitation, Sections
607.0901 and 607.0902 of the FBCA, that might otherwise apply to the Offer or
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Tender and Voting Agreement, and (viii) adopted any necessary resolutions
to provide for the treatment of Company Options as set forth in Section 6.3
of this Agreement. Subject to Section 5.3: (A) the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents; and
(B) the Company Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a
manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, and no resolution by the board
of directors of the Company or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify
the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition
Sub shall be adopted or proposed.   (b) As promptly as practicable on the
day that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC and
(following or contemporaneously with the dissemination of the Offer Statement
and related documents) disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall reflect,    4  subject to
Section 5.3, the Company Board Recommendation. The Company agrees that it
shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other
applicable Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as supplemented or amended to
correct such information to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall
be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
(including any amendment thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.
The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments.   (c) The
Company will, or will cause its transfer agent to, promptly furnish Parent
and Acquisition Sub with a list of its shareholders, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of securities
positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in
each case true and correct as of the most recent practicable date, and will
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent or Acquisition Sub may reasonably request
in connection with the Offer and the Merger. Parent and Acquisition Sub and
their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files, will use such information only in connection with
the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will,
upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy, and will use their
reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver to the Company or
destroy, all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then
in their possession or control.   1.3 DIRECTORS.   (a) Effective upon the
acceptance for payment of any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded
up to the next whole number, on the Company\'s board of directors that equals
the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company\'s board of
directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant
to this Section) and (ii) a fraction whose numerator is the aggregate number
of shares of Company Common Stock then beneficially owned by Parent or
Acquisition Sub (including shares of Company Common Stock accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer), and whose denominator is the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, and the Company shall take
all commercially reasonable actions necessary to cause Parent\'s designees to
be elected or appointed to the Company\'s board of directors, including
increasing the number of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors. At such time, to the extent requested by Parent, the
Company will also use all commercially reasonable actions to cause
individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded
up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Company\'s board of
directors and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company
(and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as
individuals designated by Parent represent on the board of directors of
the Company. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3, the parties
hereto shall use their    5  respective commercially reasonable efforts
to cause at least two (2) of the members of the Company\'s board of
directors, at all times prior to the Effective Time, to be individuals who
were directors of the Company and were not officers or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (the "Continuing
Directors"); provided, however, that if at any time prior to the Effective
Time there shall be in office only one (1) Continuing Director for
any reason, the Company\'s board of directors shall cause a person who is not
an officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries designated
by the remaining Continuing Director to fill such vacancy (and such person
shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this
Agreement), and if at any time prior to the Effective Time no Continuing
Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in office
shall use reasonable efforts to designate two (2) persons to fill such
vacancies who are not officers or employees or affiliates of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective affiliates
(and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes
of this Agreement).   (b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint
Parent\'s designees to the Company\'s board of directors shall be subject to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The
Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule
14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and
directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act require in
order to fulfill its obligations under this Section, so long as Parent shall
have provided to the Company on a timely basis the information with respect
to Parent and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act. The provisions of this
Section 1.3 are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which
Acquisition Sub, Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable
law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.   (c) Following
the election or appointment of Parent\'s designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a)
and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing
Directors or if there shall only be one (1), of a Continuing Director, shall
be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the
authorization of the Company\'s board of directors and no other action on the
part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of this Agreement by
the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the
Company\'s board of directors, any extension of time for performance of
any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Acquisition Sub requiring
the consent of the Company, any waiver of compliance by the Company of any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company
or its shareholders, any required or permitted consent or action by the board
of directors of the Company hereunder and any other action of the Company
hereunder which adversely affects the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock (other than Parent or Acquisition Sub); provided, that, if for any
reason there shall be no Continuing Directors and the Company has used
commercially reasonable efforts to appoint Continuing Directors, such actions
may be effected by majority vote of the entire board of directors of the
Company.   SECTION 2: MERGER TRANSACTION   2.1 MERGER OF ACQUISITION SUB
INTO THE COMPANY. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with the FBCA, at the Effective Time,
Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate

which shall be no later than the fifth (5th) business day after
the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the

delivered at the Closing and other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence
of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another
date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement, articles of merger satisfying the
applicable requirements of the FBCA shall be duly executed by the Company
and, concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida. The Merger shall become
effective upon the date and time of the filing of such articles of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida, or at such later time as
is specified in the articles of merger (the "Effective Time").   2.4
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:   (a) subject to
Section 6.5(a), the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the
articles of incorporation of Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with
the provisions thereof and applicable law;   (b) subject to Section 6.5(a),
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of
the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Acquisition Sub as in effect

directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time
shall be the respective individuals who are directors of Acquisition Sub

Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective
individuals who are officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until

be.    7    2.5 CONVERSION OF SHARES.   (a) At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Company or any shareholder of the Company:   (i) any
shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Company\'s treasury) shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;   (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock,
if any, then held by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;   (iii)
except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to Sections
2.5(b) and 2.7, each share of Company Common Stock then outstanding shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Amount (the "Merger
Consideration"), without interest; and   (iv) each of the shares of the
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Acquisition Sub then outstanding
shall be converted into one (1) share of Company Common Stock.   (b) If,
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class
of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
change or transaction.   2.6 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES; STOCK TRANSFER
BOOKS.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the "Paying Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to
receive the funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.5. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock.   (b) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the "Certificates") shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant
to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other    8  documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be
canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder
of such Certificate. If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
formerly evidencing shares of Company Common Stock is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Acquisition Sub that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6(b), each Certificate
shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct)
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate.   (c)
At any time following the sixth (6th) month after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including,
without limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying
Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such
holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to five (5) years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Body), any amounts payable in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (d) At the
close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Law.    9    (e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the
Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable
in the Merger to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.   2.7 NO DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS. Pursuant to Section 607.1302(4) of
the FBCA, no shareholder of the Company shall be entitled to exercise
dissenters\' rights under Sections 607.1301-1302 and 607.1320 of the FBCA as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Offer and the Merger.   2.8 FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be reasonably
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Acquisition Sub and the Company, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized
(in the name of Acquisition Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to
take such action.   SECTION 3: REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (it
being acknowledged that disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter with

or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve
or resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal; provided, that

the Company or the Company\'s board of directors from taking and disclosing
to the Company\'s shareholders a position with respect to a tender or
exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, provided that Company may not, except as permitted by
Section 5.3(b), withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, the
Company Board Recommendation or approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement,
the Company will immediately cease any existing activities, discussions
or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any of
the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time of acceptance
of Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer, the Company may
furnish information concerning its businesses or its Subsidiaries, properties
or assets to any Person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act and the
rules promulgated thereunder) and may negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Person or group concerning a Superior
Proposal (as defined below), provided that such Person or group shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement, the confidentiality provisions of
which shall not be materially more favorable to such third party than those
provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such
confidentiality agreement must permit the Company to disclose to Parent all
of the information required to be disclosed by the Company to Parent by this
Section 5.3) if:    33    (x) such Person or group has submitted a
Superior Proposal;   (y) in the good faith opinion of the Company\'s board
of directors,  determined only after consulting with independent legal
counsel to the  Company, such action is required to discharge the board\'s
fiduciary  duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable law;
and   (z) the Company has notified Parent in writing of its intention to 
engage in such discussions or negotiations or to provide such  confidential
information not less than the twenty-four (24) hours prior  to so
doing.  The Company will promptly (but in no case later than twenty-four
(24) hours after receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing of the existence
of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry received by the Company
regarding any Acquisition Proposal, and the Company will immediately
communicate to Parent the terms of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or
inquiry which it may receive regarding any Acquisition Proposal (and will
promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials (including
e-mails) received by the Company or its Representatives in connection with
such proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry) and the identity of the
party making such proposal or inquiry or engaging in such discussion or
negotiation. The Company will promptly provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company provided to any other Person in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided to Parent.
The Company will keep Parent informed on a prompt basis of the status and
details of any such Acquisition Proposal and of any amendments or proposed
amendments to any Acquisition Proposal and of the status of any discussions
or negotiations relating to any Acquisition Proposal.   (b) Except as set
forth in this Section 5.3(b), neither the board of directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the
Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with Section
5.3(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5.3, prior to the time of acceptance for payment
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the Company\'s board of
directors, after consulting with independent legal counsel, may withdraw or
modify the Company Board Recommendation, approve or recommend a Superior
Proposal, or enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, if
the board determines in good faith that such action is required to discharge
the board\'s fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable
law, provided that in each case the Company has given Parent written notice
at least three (3) business days in advance of such action that the board of
directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal which it intends to
accept, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal.   (c)
Nothing in this Section 5.3, and no action taken by the board of directors of
the Company pursuant to this Section 5.3, will (i) permit the Company to
enter into any agreement providing for any transaction contemplated by an
Acquisition Proposal for as long as this Agreement remains in effect or (ii)
affect in any manner any other obligation of the Company under this
Agreement.    34    (d) For purposes of this Agreement,
"Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide offer, proposal or other
indication of interest regarding any of the following (other than the
transactions provided for in this Agreement involving the Company): (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, business combination
or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or
other disposition of all or a significant portion of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including, without
limitation, any license, lease or other transfer or disposition of all or a
significant portion of the Software and Intangibles of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of
related transactions; (iii) any purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer
for ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities
Act in connection therewith; or (iv) any public announcement of a proposal,
plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in
any of the foregoing. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal"
means an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal on terms which the board of
directors of the Company, taking into consideration such matters that it
determines in good faith to be relevant (including, without limitation, the
additional time necessary to consummate the Acquisition Proposal)),
determines in good faith to be more favorable to the Company\'s shareholders
than the Offer and the Merger (based on advice of the Company\'s independent
financial advisor that the value of the consideration provided for in such
proposal is superior to the value of the consideration provided for in the
Offer), for which financing, to the extent required, is (based upon the
advice of the Company\'s independent financial advisor) reasonably capable of
being obtained; provided, however, that for purposes of this definition,
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to refer only to a transaction
involving a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.   (e) The Company
agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive
or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill"
or similar agreement to which any of the Acquired Companies is a party or
under which any of the Acquired Companies has any rights, and will use its
best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the
request of Parent. The Company also will promptly request each Person that
has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration
of a possible Acquisition Proposal or equity investment to return all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of any of the Acquired Companies. The Company shall not take any actions, or
omit to take any actions, inconsistent with the terms of the Tender and
Voting Agreement or this Agreement.   SECTION 6: ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE
PARTIES   6.1 SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL; PROXY STATEMENT.   (a) If the adoption
of this Agreement by the Company\'s shareholders is required by applicable
Law, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the date the
Acquisition Sub shall accept for payment shares of Company Common Stock, take
all action necessary under all applicable Law to call, give notice of and
hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock to vote on the adoption
of this Agreement (the "Company Shareholders\' Meeting"). The Company shall
ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company
Shareholders\' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable
Law.     35    (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the
Company\'s shareholders is required by Law, the Company shall, as soon as
practicable following the date the Acquisition Sub shall accept for payment
shares of Company Common Stock, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement and shall use all reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of
the SEC or its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company\'s shareholders, as promptly as practicable. The Company shall notify
Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and
of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with
copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall give Parent an
opportunity to comment on any correspondence with the SEC or its staff or any
proposed material to be included in the Proxy Statement prior to transmission
to the SEC or its staff and shall not transmit any such material to which
Parent reasonably objects. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders\'
Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare such
an amendment or supplement and after obtaining the consent of Parent to such
amendment or supplement, shall promptly transmit such amendment or supplement
to the Company\'s shareholders.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if Acquisition Sub shall own by virtue
of the Offer or otherwise at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (such that the conditions of Section 607.1104(1)(a) are
satisfied), the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action to
cause the merger of Acquisition Sub and the Company to become effective as
soon as practicable after the expiration date of the Offer (as such
expiration date may have been extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement) without a shareholders\' meeting in accordance with Section
607.1104 of the FBCA (a "Short Form Merger").   (d) Parent agrees to cause
all shares of Company Common Stock, if any, owned by Parent or any subsidiary
of Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of the Agreement at the
Company Shareholders\' Meeting.   6.2 REGULATORY APPROVALs. Each party shall
use all reasonable efforts to file, as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed
by such party with any Governmental Body with respect to the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to
submit promptly any additional information requested by any such Governmental
Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file any
notifications required under any applicable antitrust Laws in connection with
the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable to
any inquiries or requests received from any antitrust authority or other
Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related matters. Each of
the Company and Parent shall (a) give the other party prompt notice of the
commencement or threat of commencement of any Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Body with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) keep the other party
informed as to the status of any such Proceeding or threat, and (c) promptly
inform the other party of any communication to or from any Governmental Body
regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by
any Law, (y) each party will consult and cooperate with the other, and will
consider in good faith    36  the views of the other, in connection with
any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, Proceeding under
or relating to any foreign, federal or state antitrust or fair trade Law, and
(z) in connection with any such Proceeding, each party will permit authorized
Representatives of the other to be present at each meeting or conference
relating to any such Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Body in connection with any such Proceeding. At the request, and
only at the request, of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell,
dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits its freedom of action with respect to its or its Subsidiaries\'
ability to operate or retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that any such action is
conditioned upon the consummation of the Offer.   6.3 STOCK OPTIONS.   (a)
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Option will
be entitled to receive from the Company, and shall receive, in settlement of
each Company Option a "Cash Amount". All Options shall terminate as of the
Effective Time. The "Cash Amount" shall be equal to the difference between
the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Company Option at the Effective Time and
(ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Option less any applicable
Tax withholdings. Except as may be otherwise agreed to by Parent and the
Company, all stock option plans established by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions
in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant
of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company shall be deleted, terminated and of no further
force or effect as of the Effective Time.   (b) Prior to the Effective
Time, at the request of Parent, the Company shall take all action (including
amending any and all of the Company\'s existing stock option plans and
program and any and all stock option agreements) that Parent determines may
be necessary (under the plans pursuant to which Company Options are
outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 6.3
and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company
Options have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically
provided in this Section 6.3.   6.4 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.   (a) Parent agrees
that all employees of the Acquired Companies who continue employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") shall
be eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving Corporation\'s or
Parent\'s health and welfare benefit plans; provided, however, that (i)
nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the
right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such
health or welfare benefit plan at any time (including as of the Effective
Time), and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such
health or welfare benefit plan, then the Continuing Employees shall
be immediately eligible to participate in Parent\'s health and welfare
Plans ("Parent Employee Benefit Plans") to substantially the same extent as
similarly situated employees of Parent. Immediately after the Effective Time,
the Continuing Employees shall be entitled to participate in a plan that
contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section
401(k) of the Code sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or
its    37   Subsidiaries (a "Parent 401(k) Plan"). Each Continuing
Employee\'s period of service and compensation history with the Company and
the Acquired Companies shall be counted in determining eligibility for, and
the amount and vesting of, benefits under each Parent Employee Benefit Plan
(including, without limitation, the Parent 401(k) Plan). Each Continuing
Employee who participates in a Parent Employee Benefit Plan that provides
health care benefits (whether or not through insurance) shall participate
without regard to any waiting period or any condition or exclusion based on
pre-existing conditions, medical history, claims experience, evidence of
insurability, or genetic factors, and shall receive full credit for any co-
payments or deductible payments, or account balances under any cafeteria or
flexible spending plan made before the Closing Date. In the event that any
Continuing Employee receives an "eligible rollover distribution" (within the
meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from an Employee Benefit Plan of
the Company intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company
401(k) Plan"), Parent shall cause a Parent 401(k) Plan to accept a direct
rollover of such eligible rollover distribution (including, but not limited
to, any portion of such eligible rollover distribution comprised of
the outstanding balance of a loan from such Company 401(k) Plan). Nothing in
this Section 6.4(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to
create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation and the
employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.   (b)
If Parent directs any Acquired Company, the Acquired Company shall terminate,
effective as of the day immediately prior to and contingent upon the Acquired
Company becoming a member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as
such term is defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the "401(k)
Termination Date"), any 401(k) Plan sponsored by any of the Acquired
Companies (or in which any of the Acquired Companies participate).
The Acquired Companies shall provide Parent evidence that such 401(k) Plans
have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors of
the applicable Acquired Company (the form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to review and approval of Parent) effective as of the 401(k)
Termination Date.   6.5 INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.   (a)
All rights to indemnification existing in favor of those Persons who are or
have at any time been directors and officers of the Company (the "Indemnified
Persons") for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time,
as provided in the Company\'s bylaws, articles of incorporation and
indemnification agreements with its directors and officers, or the FBCA, each
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and
shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation to the fullest
extent available under Florida law for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time.   (b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect the Company\'s existing policies of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance ("DandO; Policies") through their expiration date of July
1, 2003 (the "Expiration Date") or shall purchase a "tail" policy of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance (a "Tail Policy") for the
benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time providing coverage comparable to the
Company\'s existing DandO; Policies through the Expiration Date, and, to the
extent available from the Company\'s current insurance carriers, extend the
DandO; Policies or purchase a Tail Policy for an additional one (1) year period
until July 1, 2004 (the "Extended Expiration Date") for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation
shall not    38   be required to pay an aggregate premium for such DandO;
Policies and Tail Policies in excess of $300,000. The Surviving Corporation
may elect after July 1, 2004 to purchase a Tail Policy for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time providing coverage comparable to the Company\'s
existing DandO; Policies, covering the period of time from the Extended
Expiration Date until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time.  
(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate the
purposes of this Section 6.5, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations of Parent set
forth in this Section 6.5, and none of the actions described in clause "(i)"
or clause "(ii)" shall be taken until such provision is made.   (d) Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the Surviving
Corporation\'s obligations under this Section 6.5. In the event that at any
time from and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation does not have the DandO; Policies
or Tail Policies required or permitted by Section 6.5(b), Parent shall
guarantee the indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation to the
Indemnified Persons under this Section 6.5 in an amount not to exceed in the
aggregate the Guaranteed Amount. The "Guaranteed Amount" shall mean (i) Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000) less (ii) any amounts paid to or for the
benefit of any or all of the Indemnified Persons by the Surviving Corporation
or the Parent (or any other affiliate of Parent) or pursuant to the DandO;
Policies or the Tail Policy or any other directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance maintained by or on behalf of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (or any other affiliate of Parent); provided, however, that
except as provided in this subsection (d), Parent shall have no other
obligations concerning indemnification with respect to Indemnified Persons or
the guarantee of indemnification obligations. Nothing contained in this
Section 6.5 shall be construed to obligate Parent to provide general funding
or other financial support to Surviving Corporation.   (e) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Net Tangible Assets of Parent, as reflected in its
audited financial statements for any fiscal year ended after December 31,
2003 and prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, is less
than Five Hundred Million Dollars ($500,000,000), the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly purchase one or more new "tail" policies of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance (individually and collectively, the "New
Policies") for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to their
acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time providing coverage
in an amount equal to the Guaranteed Amount as of such date and otherwise
comparable to the Company\'s existing DandO; Policies covering the period of
time commencing on the date such New Policies are issued until the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time. Further, the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly purchase such New Policies in an amount equal to the
Guaranteed Amount as of such date prior to (i) the filing of a voluntary or
involuntary bankruptcy proceeding of Parent as debtor, (ii) an assignment for
the benefit of creditors by or on behalf of Parent, or (iii) any other
insolvency proceeding involving Parent, in any case covering the period
of time commencing on the date such New Policies are issued until the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time.   (f) The provisions of this
Section 6.5 shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person and his heirs and
representatives.    39    6.6 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.   (a) Subject to
Section 6.6(b), Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and
the Merger and make effective the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to
Section 6.6(b), each party to this Agreement (i) shall make all filings and
give all notices required to be made and given by such party in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if
any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or Contract, or
otherwise) by such party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and each
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) shall use
all reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar
to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party shall promptly deliver to the other parties a copy
of each such filing made, each such notice given and each such Consent
obtained by such party during the Pre-Closing Period.   (b) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall not have
any obligation under this Agreement: (i) to dispose of or transfer or cause
any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to commit to
cause any of the Acquired Companies to dispose of any assets; (ii) to
discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any
product or service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to
discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise
make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make
available, to any Person, any technology, Software or Intangible, or to
commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to license or otherwise make
available to any Person any technology, Software or Intangible; (iv) to hold
separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or
operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to cause
any of the Acquired Companies to hold separate any assets or operations; (v)
to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to
any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future operations or the
future operations of any of the Acquired Companies; or (vi) to contest any
Proceeding relating to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement if Parent determines in good faith that
contesting such Proceeding might not be advisable.   6.7 DISCLOSURE. Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or any Representative of any of the
Acquired Companies to, make any disclosure to employees of any of the
Acquired Companies, to the public or otherwise regarding the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless
(a) Parent shall have been given the opportunity to review and comment upon
such disclosure and shall have approved such disclosure or (b) the Company
shall have been advised in writing by its outside legal counsel that such
disclosure is required by applicable law.   6.8 RESIGNATION OF OFFICERS AND
DIRECTORS. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and deliver to Parent on or prior to the acceptance of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer the resignation of each director of each
of the Acquired Companies (subject to Section 1.3) and such officers of the
Acquired Companies as Parent shall request.    40    6.9 GENERAL
COOPERATION. From the date hereof through the Effective Time, the Acquired
Companies will use their good faith efforts to operate their businesses in
such a manner as to achieve a smooth transition consistent with the
respective business interests of the Acquired Companies and Parent. In this
regard, the Acquired Companies and Parent agree that they will enter into
good faith discussions concerning the businesses of the Acquired Companies,
including, but not limited to, personnel policies and procedures, and other
operational matters.   SECTION 7: CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE MERGER   The

performed and complied, in all material respects, with each material covenant
or agreement contained in the Agreement and required to be performed
or complied with by it; provided, however, if such inaccuracy or breach is
