                           1285 Drummers Lane, Suite 300

DATE:                      FEBRUARY 4, 2003

                                   BACKGROUND

         A.       The respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Company have each determined that it is advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company
upon the terms and provisions of and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

         B.       It is proposed that Acquisition Sub make a cash tender offer
(the "Offer") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $.01 par
value per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") for $7.00 per share
(such amount, or any greater per share amount paid pursuant to the Offer,
subject to Section 1.1(e), being the "Per Share Amount"), upon the terms and
provisions of and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

         C.       In furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent,
the respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company
have each approved a merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Sub with and into the
Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation, upon the terms and
provisions of and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

         D.       By resolutions duly adopted, the board of directors of the
Company has, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions hereof: (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders, among others; and (ii) resolved to recommend that
the shareholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares
pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement.

         E.       In order to induce Parent and Acquisition Sub to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
concurrently with the execution and

<PAGE>
delivery of this Agreement certain of the shareholders, executive officers and
directors of the Company set forth on Exhibit B hereto are executing one or more
tender and voting agreements in favor of Parent and Acquisition Sub
(collectively, the "Tender and Voting Agreement").

         F.       Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set
forth in Exhibit A hereto.

         INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, in consideration of the mutual
agreements contained herein and subject to the satisfaction of the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                              SECTION 1: THE OFFER

         1.1      CONDUCT OF THE OFFER.

                  (a)      Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with Section 8 hereof and that none of the events or
circumstances set forth in Annex I shall have occurred or exist (excluding the
events or circumstances set forth in paragraphs "(a)" and "(d)" in Annex I), as
promptly as practicable (and in any event not later than ten (10) business days
after the date of this Agreement, provided that the Company has, within a
reasonable time prior theretofore, provided Parent with the information about
the Company required to be included in the Offer Statement (defined below)),
Acquisition Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) the Offer.

                  (b)      Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall accept for payment all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
it is permitted to do so under applicable Law and shall pay for such shares
promptly thereafter (and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act). The obligation of Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and to
pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall
be subject to (i) the condition that there shall be validly tendered and not
withdrawn a number of shares of Company Common Stock that (including the shares
tendered under the Tender and Voting Agreement) immediately prior to the
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
("Parent-Owned Shares"), represents at least a majority of the Fully Diluted
Number of Company Shares (the "Minimum Condition") and (ii) the other conditions
set forth in Annex I. Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right at its sole
discretion to increase the initial Per Share Amount, to waive (in whole or in
part) any of the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex I or to make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided that without
the prior written consent of the Company: (i) the Minimum Condition may not be
amended or waived; (ii) no change may be made that changes the form of
consideration to be paid, reduces the Per Share Amount or changes the number of
shares of Company Common Stock sought in the Offer, or that imposes conditions
to the Offer in addition to the Minimum Condition and the conditions set forth
in Annex 1; (iii) except as provided in Section 1.1(c), no change may be made
that extends the expiration date of the Offer beyond the initial expiration date
of the Offer, and (iv) no change may be made that amends any other terms of the
Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of the Company Common Stock.

                  (c)      The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire
twenty (20) business days following the date of the commencement thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the parties' respective termination rights under


                                       2
<PAGE>
Section 8.1, (i) if, at any then-scheduled expiration date, any of the
conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived, Acquisition Sub shall
be entitled to extend the Offer for such amount of time as is reasonably
necessary to cause such conditions to the Offer to be satisfied; (ii)
Acquisition Sub may, without the consent of the Company or any other Person (A)
extend the Offer (one (1) or more times) for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC applicable to the Offer and
(B) if the sum of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that shall
have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (other than
shares tendered by guaranteed delivery where actual delivery has not occurred)
as of the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, plus (2) the
number of Parent-Owned Shares as of such date, represents more than a majority
of the Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares but less than 80% of the Fully
Diluted Number of Company Shares as of such date (or, if greater, the number and
type of shares of Company Common Stock, including shares of Company Common Stock
Entitled to Vote and shares of Company Common Stock not Entitled to Vote,
required to satisfy the conditions of Section 607.1104(1)(a) of the FBCA),
extend the Offer (one (1) or more times) for an aggregate additional period of
not more than twenty (20) business days; (iii) Acquisition Sub may, without the
consent of the Company or any other Person, elect to provide for a subsequent
offering period (and one (1) or more extensions thereof) pursuant to, and in
accordance with the terms of, Rule 14d under the Exchange Act; and (iv) if, at
any then-scheduled expiration date any of the conditions to the Offer have not
been satisfied or waived, Acquisition Sub shall, if the Company so requests in
writing, extend the Offer for ten (10) business days; provided, however, that
Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the expiration date more than
one (1) time pursuant to this clause (iv).

                  (d)      On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer which will contain or incorporate by reference the
offer to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the
"Offer Statement") and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause
the Offer Statement and related documents to be disseminated to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that they shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto (which together constitute the "Offer Documents") to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Company agrees to use all reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the
Offer, to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents as supplemented or amended to correct such information to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Acquisition
Sub all information concerning the Acquired Companies and the Company's
shareholders that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any
action contemplated by this Section 1.1(d). The Company and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
(including any amendment thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.
Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any
comments Parent, Acquisition Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such
comments.

                  (e)      If, between the date of this Agreement and the date
on which any particular share of Company Common Stock is accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are
changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Per Share Amount shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such change or transaction.

         1.2      COMPANY ACTIONS.

                  (a)      The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer
and represents that its board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held,
has by the unanimous vote of all directors of the Company (i) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the
requirements of the Florida Business Corporation Act ("FBCA"), (iii) declared
that this Agreement is advisable, (iv) resolved to recommend that shareholders
of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement (the recommendation of the
Company's board of directors that the shareholders of the Company accept the
Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and
adopt this Agreement being referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation"),
(v) approved the Tender and Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, (vi) adopted a resolution that Acquisition Sub shall have full voting
rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock owned by the shareholders
who execute the Tender and Voting Agreement, including Tyler Technologies, Inc.
("Tyler"), that are acquired by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer and that
the proxy agents named pursuant to the Tender and Voting Agreement shall have
full voting rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
shareholders who execute the Tender and Voting Agreement, including Tyler, for
which a proxy has been given pursuant to the Tender and Voting Agreement, (vii)
to the extent necessary, adopted a resolution having the effect of causing the
Company, the Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby not to be subject to any state takeover law or
similar Law, including, without limitation, Sections 607.0901 and 607.0902 of
the FBCA, that might otherwise apply to the Offer or the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Tender and Voting
Agreement, and (viii) adopted any necessary resolutions to provide for the
treatment of Company Options as set forth in Section 6.3 of this Agreement.
Subject to Section 5.3: (A) the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the
Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents; and (B) the Company Board
Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent
or Acquisition Sub, and no resolution by the board of directors of the Company
or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub shall be adopted or proposed.

                  (b)      As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer
is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC and (following or
contemporaneously with the dissemination of the Offer Statement and related
documents) disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the

14D-9") that shall reflect,


                                       4
<PAGE>
subject to Section 5.3, the Company Board Recommendation. The Company agrees
that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable
Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees to promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 as supplemented or amended to correct such information
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment thereto) prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its
counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments.

                  (c)      The Company will, or will cause its transfer agent
to, promptly furnish Parent and Acquisition Sub with a list of its shareholders,
mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names
and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists
of securities positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock
depositories, in each case true and correct as of the most recent practicable
date, and will provide to Parent such additional information (including updated
lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and
such other assistance as Parent or Acquisition Sub may reasonably request in
connection with the Offer and the Merger. Parent and Acquisition Sub and their
agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, will use such information only in connection with the Offer
and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon request,
deliver to the Company or destroy, and will use their reasonable efforts to
cause their agents to deliver to the Company or destroy, all copies and any
extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or control.

         1.3      DIRECTORS.

                  (a)      Effective upon the acceptance for payment of any
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled
to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company's board of directors that equals the product of (i) the total number
of directors on the Company's board of directors (giving effect to the election
of any additional directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) a fraction whose
numerator is the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock then
beneficially owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub (including shares of Company
Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer), and whose denominator
is the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, and the
Company shall take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to cause
Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company's board of
directors, including increasing the number of directors, and seeking and
accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, to the extent
requested by Parent, the Company will also use all commercially reasonable
actions to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of
members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the
Company's board of directors and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary
of the Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage
as individuals designated by Parent represent on the board of directors of the
Company. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3, the parties hereto
shall use their


                                       5
<PAGE>
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause at least two (2) of the
members of the Company's board of directors, at all times prior to the Effective
Time, to be individuals who were directors of the Company and were not officers
or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (the
"Continuing Directors"); provided, however, that if at any time prior to the
Effective Time there shall be in office only one (1) Continuing Director for any
reason, the Company's board of directors shall cause a person who is not an
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries designated by the
remaining Continuing Director to fill such vacancy (and such person shall be
deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement), and if
at any time prior to the Effective Time no Continuing Directors then remain, the
other directors of the Company then in office shall use reasonable efforts to
designate two (2) persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers or
employees or affiliates of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent or Acquisition
Sub or any of their respective affiliates (and such persons shall be deemed to
be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement).

                  (b)      The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's
designees to the Company's board of directors shall be subject to Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act require in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section, so long as Parent shall have provided to the
Company on a timely basis the information with respect to Parent and its
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 of the Exchange Act. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to
and shall not limit any rights which Acquisition Sub, Parent or any of their
affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common
Stock as a matter of applicable law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

                  (c)      Following the election or appointment of Parent's
designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval
of a majority of the Continuing Directors or if there shall only be one (1), of
a Continuing Director, shall be required to authorize (and such authorization
shall constitute the authorization of the Company's board of directors and no
other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other
director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of this
Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by
the Company's board of directors, any extension of time for performance of any
obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Acquisition Sub requiring the
consent of the Company, any waiver of compliance by the Company of any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company or its
shareholders, any required or permitted consent or action by the board of
directors of the Company hereunder and any other action of the Company hereunder
which adversely affects the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Parent or Acquisition Sub); provided, that, if for any reason there shall
be no Continuing Directors and the Company has used commercially reasonable
efforts to appoint Continuing Directors, such actions may be effected by
majority vote of the entire board of directors of the Company.

         2.5      CONVERSION OF SHARES.

                  (a)      At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company
or any shareholder of the Company:

                           (i)      any shares of Company Common Stock then held
by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the
Company's treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

                           (ii)     any shares of Company Common Stock, if any,
then held by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

                           (iii)    except as provided in clauses "(i)" and
"(ii)" above and subject to Sections 2.5(b) and 2.7, each share of Company
Common Stock then outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Amount (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest; and

                           (iv)     each of the shares of the common stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of Acquisition Sub then outstanding shall be
converted into one (1) share of Company Common Stock.

                  (b)      If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into
a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change
or transaction.

         2.6      SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES; STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS.

                  (a)      Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the
"Paying Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the
funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section
2.5. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent
or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole
and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of
such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common
Stock.

                  (b)      As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was,
at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the
"Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other


                                       8
<PAGE>
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such
Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If the payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate formerly evidencing shares of Company
Common Stock is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Acquisition Sub that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.6(b), each Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such
Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to
provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent
may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate.

                  (c)      At any time following the sixth (6th) month after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
(including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter,
such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered
in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to five (5) years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Body), any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

                  (d)      At the close of business on the day of the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein
or by applicable Law.

                  (e)      Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying
Agent to deduct and withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable in the
Merger to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

         2.7      NO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. Pursuant to Section 607.1302(4) of the
FBCA, no shareholder of the Company shall be entitled to exercise dissenters'
rights under Sections 607.1301-1302 and 607.1320 of the FBCA as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger.

         2.8      FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be reasonably necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Acquisition Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Acquisition
Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Companies' knowledge, there are no facts which could form the basis for any such
Proceeding. There are no investigations or audits of any of Acquired Companies'
Employee Benefit Plans, any trusts under such plans, the plan sponsor, the plan
administrator or any fiduciary of any such plan that have been instituted or, to

knowledge, there are no facts which could form the basis for any such
investigation or audit, the results of which would reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to the Acquired Companies. Except as set forth in Section
3.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter, no event has occurred nor to the
knowledge of the Company will occur which will result in any of the Acquired
Companies having an obligation in connection with any Employee Benefit Plan

the Proxy Statement is mailed to the shareholders of the Company or at the time
of the Company Shareholders' Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

         4.5      FUNDS. Acquisition Sub has, or will have prior to the
consummation of the Offer, sufficient liquid cash funds available to permit
Acquisition Sub to satisfy the obligation to pay for shares of Company Common
Stock in the Offer and to pay the Merger Consideration in the Merger.

                  SECTION 5: CERTAIN COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

or affecting this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.1 to the contrary, no

effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of any condition
contained herein.

deposited or is required to be deposited in escrow under the terms of such
Specified Contract; and (v) the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any

         5.3      NO SOLICITATION.

                  (a)      The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize (and shall use its best efforts not to
permit) any affiliate, officer, director, manager or employee of, or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative (collectively,
"Representatives") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit,
initiate, facilitate or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries
relating to, or the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish to any Person any
information or data with respect to or provide access to the properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or take any other action to facilitate the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition
Proposal; provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 5.3 or any other provision
hereof shall prohibit the Company or the Company's board of directors from
taking and disclosing to the Company's shareholders a position with respect to a
tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that Company may not, except as
permitted by Section 5.3(b), withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or
modify, the Company Board Recommendation or approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement, the
Company will immediately cease any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time of acceptance of
Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer, the Company may furnish
information concerning its businesses or its Subsidiaries, properties or assets
to any Person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder) and may negotiate and participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person or group concerning a Superior Proposal (as
defined below), provided that such Person or group shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement, the confidentiality provisions of which shall not be
materially more favorable to such third party than those provided for in the
Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement must
permit the Company to disclose to Parent all of the information required to be
disclosed by the Company to Parent by this Section 5.3) if:


                                       33
<PAGE>

         (x)      such Person or group has submitted a Superior Proposal;

         (y)      in the good faith opinion of the Company's board of directors,
         determined only after consulting with independent legal counsel to the
         Company, such action is required to discharge the board's fiduciary
         duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law; and

         (z)      the Company has notified Parent in writing of its intention to
         engage in such discussions or negotiations or to provide such
         confidential information not less than the twenty-four (24) hours prior
         to so doing.

The Company will promptly (but in no case later than twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing of the existence of any
proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry received by the Company regarding
any Acquisition Proposal, and the Company will immediately communicate to Parent
the terms of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry which it may
receive regarding any Acquisition Proposal (and will promptly provide to Parent
copies of any written materials (including e-mails) received by the Company or
its Representatives in connection with such proposal, discussion, negotiation or
inquiry) and the identity of the party making such proposal or inquiry or
engaging in such discussion or negotiation. The Company will promptly provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company provided to any other
Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not previously
provided to Parent. The Company will keep Parent informed on a prompt basis of
the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal and of any amendments or
proposed amendments to any Acquisition Proposal and of the status of any
discussions or negotiations relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

                  (b)      Except as set forth in this Section 5.3(b), neither
the board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with Section 5.3(a)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to compliance with the provisions of this
Section 5.3, prior to the time of acceptance for payment of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, the Company's board of directors, after consulting with
independent legal counsel, may withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation, approve or recommend a Superior Proposal, or enter into an
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, if the board determines in good
faith that such action is required to discharge the board's fiduciary duties to
the Company's shareholders under applicable law, provided that in each case the
Company has given Parent written notice at least three (3) business days in
advance of such action that the board of directors of the Company has received a
Superior Proposal which it intends to accept, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such
Superior Proposal.

                  (c)      Nothing in this Section 5.3, and no action taken by
the board of directors of the Company pursuant to this Section 5.3, will (i)
permit the Company to enter into any agreement providing for any transaction
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal for as long as this Agreement remains in
effect or (ii) affect in any manner any other obligation of the Company under
this Agreement.


                                       34
<PAGE>

                  (d)      For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition
Proposal" means any bona fide offer, proposal or other indication of interest
regarding any of the following (other than the transactions provided for in this
Agreement involving the Company): (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, business combination or other similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange,
mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of all or a significant portion
of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including,
without limitation, any license, lease or other transfer or disposition of all
or a significant portion of the Software and Intangibles of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions; (iii) any purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for ten
percent (10%) or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company,
or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection
therewith; or (iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to
do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal on terms which the board of directors of the Company, taking into
consideration such matters that it determines in good faith to be relevant
(including, without limitation, the additional time necessary to consummate the
Acquisition Proposal)), determines in good faith to be more favorable to the
Company's shareholders than the Offer and the Merger (based on advice of the
Company's independent financial advisor that the value of the consideration
provided for in such proposal is superior to the value of the consideration
provided for in the Offer), for which financing, to the extent required, is
(based upon the advice of the Company's independent financial advisor)
reasonably capable of being obtained; provided, however, that for purposes of
this definition, "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to refer only to a
transaction involving a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the
Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

                  (e)      The Company agrees not to release or permit the
release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision
of, any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the
Acquired Companies is a party or under which any of the Acquired Companies has
any rights, and will use its best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced
each such agreement at the request of Parent. The Company also will promptly
request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal or equity investment
to return all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or
on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies. The Company shall not take any
actions, or omit to take any actions, inconsistent with the terms of the Tender
and Voting Agreement or this Agreement.

                 SECTION 6: ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

         6.1      SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL; PROXY STATEMENT.

                  (a)      If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
shareholders is required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable following the date the Acquisition Sub shall accept for payment
shares of Company Common Stock, take all action necessary under all applicable
Law to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common
Stock to vote on the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Shareholders'
Meeting"). The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection
with the Company Shareholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all
applicable Law.



                                       35
<PAGE>

                  (b)      If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
shareholders is required by Law, the Company shall, as soon as practicable
following the date the Acquisition Sub shall accept for payment shares of
Company Common Stock, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and
shall use all reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its
staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
shareholders, as promptly as practicable. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any
request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall give Parent an opportunity to comment on any
correspondence with the SEC or its staff or any proposed material to be included
in the Proxy Statement prior to transmission to the SEC or its staff and shall
not transmit any such material to which Parent reasonably objects. If at any
time prior to the Company Shareholders' Meeting there shall occur any event that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall promptly prepare such an amendment or supplement and after
obtaining the consent of Parent to such amendment or supplement, shall promptly
transmit such amendment or supplement to the Company's shareholders.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, if Acquisition Sub shall own by virtue of the Offer or otherwise
at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such that the
conditions of Section 607.1104(1)(a) are satisfied), the parties shall take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the merger of Acquisition Sub and the
Company to become effective as soon as practicable after the expiration date of
the Offer (as such expiration date may have been extended in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement) without a shareholders' meeting in accordance with
Section 607.1104 of the FBCA (a "Short Form Merger").

                  (d)      Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common
Stock, if any, owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor
of the adoption of the Agreement at the Company Shareholders' Meeting.

         6.2      REGULATORY APPROVALs. Each party shall use all reasonable
efforts to file, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all
notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any
Governmental Body with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to submit promptly any
additional information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, promptly after
the date of this Agreement, prepare and file any notifications required under
any applicable antitrust Laws in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from
any antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust
or related matters. Each of the Company and Parent shall (a) give the other
party prompt notice of the commencement or threat of commencement of any
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) keep
the other party informed as to the status of any such Proceeding or threat, and
(c) promptly inform the other party of any communication to or from any
Governmental Body regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body or by any Law, (y) each party will consult and cooperate with
the other, and will consider in good faith


                                       36
<PAGE>
the views of the other, in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, Proceeding under or relating to any foreign,
federal or state antitrust or fair trade Law, and (z) in connection with any
such Proceeding, each party will permit authorized Representatives of the other
to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any such Proceeding and
to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with any such
Proceeding. At the request, and only at the request, of Parent, the Company
shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or
commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to its
or its Subsidiaries' ability to operate or retain any of the businesses, product
lines or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that any
such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Offer.

         6.3      STOCK OPTIONS.

                  (a)      Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each holder
of a Company Option will be entitled to receive from the Company, and shall
receive, in settlement of each Company Option a "Cash Amount". All Options shall
terminate as of the Effective Time. The "Cash Amount" shall be equal to the
difference between the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option at the
Effective Time and (ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Option less
any applicable Tax withholdings. Except as may be otherwise agreed to by Parent
and the Company, all stock option plans established by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any
other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any
other interest in respect of the capital stock of Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company shall be deleted, terminated and of no further force or effect as of
the Effective Time.

                  (b)      Prior to the Effective Time, at the request of
Parent, the Company shall take all action (including amending any and all of the
Company's existing stock option plans and program and any and all stock option
agreements) that Parent determines may be necessary (under the plans pursuant to
which Company Options are outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 6.3 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, holders of Company Options have no rights with respect thereto other than
those specifically provided in this Section 6.3.

         6.4      EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

                  (a)      Parent agrees that all employees of the Acquired
Companies who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to continue to participate in the
Surviving Corporation's or Parent's health and welfare benefit plans; provided,
however, that (i) nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or
terminate any such health or welfare benefit plan at any time (including as of
the Effective Time), and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates
any such health or welfare benefit plan, then the Continuing Employees shall be
immediately eligible to participate in Parent's health and welfare Plans
("Parent Employee Benefit Plans") to substantially the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Parent. Immediately after the Effective Time, the
Continuing Employees shall be entitled to participate in a plan that contains a
cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Code sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or its


                                       37
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries (a "Parent 401(k) Plan"). Each Continuing Employee's period of
service and compensation history with the Company and the Acquired Companies
shall be counted in determining eligibility for, and the amount and vesting of,
benefits under each Parent Employee Benefit Plan (including, without limitation,
the Parent 401(k) Plan). Each Continuing Employee who participates in a Parent
Employee Benefit Plan that provides health care benefits (whether or not through
insurance) shall participate without regard to any waiting period or any
condition or exclusion based on pre-existing conditions, medical history, claims
experience, evidence of insurability, or genetic factors, and shall receive full
credit for any co-payments or deductible payments, or account balances under any
cafeteria or flexible spending plan made before the Closing Date. In the event
that any Continuing Employee receives an "eligible rollover distribution"
(within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from an Employee Benefit
Plan of the Company intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a
"Company 401(k) Plan"), Parent shall cause a Parent 401(k) Plan to accept a
direct rollover of such eligible rollover distribution (including, but not
limited to, any portion of such eligible rollover distribution comprised of the
outstanding balance of a loan from such Company 401(k) Plan). Nothing in this
Section 6.4(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a
right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each
Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

                  (b)      If Parent directs any Acquired Company, the Acquired
Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately prior to and
contingent upon the Acquired Company becoming a member of the same Controlled
Group of Corporations (as such term is defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as
Parent (the "401(k) Termination Date"), any 401(k) Plan sponsored by any of the
Acquired Companies (or in which any of the Acquired Companies participate). The
Acquired Companies shall provide Parent evidence that such 401(k) Plans have
been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors of the
applicable Acquired Company (the form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to review and approval of Parent) effective as of the 401(k) Termination
Date.

         6.5      INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.

                  (a)      All rights to indemnification existing in favor of
those Persons who are or have at any time been directors and officers of the
Company (the "Indemnified Persons") for their acts and omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time, as provided in the Company's bylaws, articles of
incorporation and indemnification agreements with its directors and officers, or
the FBCA, each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the
Merger and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent
available under Florida law for a period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time.

                  (b)      The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect
the Company's existing policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
("D&O Policies") through their expiration date of July 1, 2003 (the "Expiration
Date") or shall purchase a "tail" policy of directors' and officers' liability
insurance (a "Tail Policy") for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with
respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
providing coverage comparable to the Company's existing D&O Policies through the
Expiration Date, and, to the extent available from the Company's current
insurance carriers, extend the D&O Policies or purchase a Tail Policy for an
additional one (1) year period until July 1, 2004 (the "Extended Expiration
Date") for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not


                                       38
<PAGE>

be required to pay an aggregate premium for such D&O Policies and Tail
Policies in excess of $300,000. The Surviving Corporation may elect after July
1, 2004 to purchase a Tail Policy for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons
with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
providing coverage comparable to the Company's existing D&O Policies, covering
the period of time from the Extended Expiration Date until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time.

                  (c)      In the event Parent or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate
the purposes of this Section 6.5, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations of Parent set forth in
this Section 6.5, and none of the actions described in clause "(i)" or clause
"(ii)" shall be taken until such provision is made.

                  (d)      Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
perform all of the Surviving Corporation's obligations under this Section 6.5.
In the event that at any time from and after the Effective Time until the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation does not have
the D&O Policies or Tail Policies required or permitted by Section 6.5(b),
Parent shall guarantee the indemnification obligations of the Surviving
Corporation to the Indemnified Persons under this Section 6.5 in an amount not
to exceed in the aggregate the Guaranteed Amount. The "Guaranteed Amount" shall
mean (i) Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) less (ii) any amounts paid to or for
the benefit of any or all of the Indemnified Persons by the Surviving
Corporation or the Parent (or any other affiliate of Parent) or pursuant to the
D&O Policies or the Tail Policy or any other directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by or on behalf of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or
any other affiliate of Parent); provided, however, that except as provided in
this subsection (d), Parent shall have no other obligations concerning
indemnification with respect to Indemnified Persons or the guarantee of
indemnification obligations. Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall be
construed to obligate Parent to provide general funding or other financial
support to Surviving Corporation.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Net Tangible
Assets of Parent, as reflected in its audited financial statements for any
fiscal year ended after December 31, 2003 and prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, is less than Five Hundred Million Dollars
($500,000,000), the Surviving Corporation shall promptly purchase one or more
new "tail" policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
(individually and collectively, the "New Policies") for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time providing coverage in an amount equal to the Guaranteed
Amount as of such date and otherwise comparable to the Company's existing D&O
Policies covering the period of time commencing on the date such New Policies
are issued until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time. Further, the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly purchase such New Policies in an amount
equal to the Guaranteed Amount as of such date prior to (i) the filing of a
voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding of Parent as debtor, (ii) an
assignment for the benefit of creditors by or on behalf of Parent, or (iii) any
other insolvency proceeding involving Parent, in any case covering the period of
time commencing on the date such New Policies are issued until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time.

                  (f)      The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Person and his heirs and representatives.

                  (a)      Subject to Section 6.6(b), Parent and the Company

transfer any assets, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to
dispose of any assets; (ii) to discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to

Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future operations or the future

other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement
with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the

or any Representative of any of the Acquired Companies to, make any disclosure
to employees of any of the Acquired Companies, to the public or otherwise
regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement unless (a) Parent shall have been given the opportunity to review
and comment upon such disclosure and shall have approved such disclosure or (b)
the Company shall have been advised in writing by its outside legal counsel that
such disclosure is required by applicable law.

         6.8      RESIGNATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent on or prior to

Effective Time, the Acquired Companies will use their good faith efforts to
operate their businesses in such a manner as to achieve a smooth transition

enter into good faith discussions concerning the businesses of the Acquired
Companies, including, but not limited to, personnel policies and procedures, and

                  (b)      prior to the Effective Time, by either Parent or the
Company if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall
have issued a final and nonappealable order, decree or ruling, or shall have
taken any other action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining

pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or making consummation of the Offer or the
Merger illegal; provided, that in the case of a restraining order, injunction or
other order, each of the parties shall have used their commercially reasonable
efforts to prevent the entry of any such restraining order, injunction or other
order and to appeal as promptly as possible any restraining order, injunction or

required to be performed by such party at or prior to the acceptance for payment
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer; and (ii) the Company
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

business on April 18, 2003; provided, however, that: (i) a party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if the
failure of the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant

failure on the part of such party to perform any covenant in this Agreement
required to be performed by such party or a material breach of any
representation of warranty by such party at or prior to the acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer; and (ii) the
Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

warranties are qualified by a Material Adverse Effect qualification, in which
case any such representations and warranties shall not be true and correct in
any respect, in each case as of the date of this Agreement or as of a date
subsequent to the date of this Agreement as if made on such subsequent date
(other than to the extent any such representations and warranties expressly
relate to an earlier date, in which case any such representations and warranties
shall not be true and correct in any material respect as of such earlier date,
determined without regard to any knowledge or materiality qualifications
therein, except to the extent any such representations and warranties are
qualified by a Material Adverse Effect qualification, in which case any such

                                       42
<PAGE>

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) the Company shall not
have performed and complied, in all material respects, with each material
covenant or agreement contained in the Agreement and required to be performed or
complied with by it; provided, however, if such inaccuracy or breach is curable
by the Company, then Parent may not terminate the Agreement under this Section

ten (10)-business day period commencing upon delivery by Parent of written
notice to the Company of such inaccuracy or breach, provided the Company
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or
breach during such ten (10)-business day period;

date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent
date) (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate

be true and correct as of such earlier date), except where such failure does not
have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to
consummate the Offer or the Merger; or (ii) if Parent shall not have complied
with, in all material respects, Parent's covenants contained in this Agreement,
except where such noncompliance does not have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to consummate the Offer or the Merger;
provided, however, if such inaccuracy or breach is curable by Parent, then the
Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(g) with respect
to a particular inaccuracy or breach prior to or during the ten (10)-business
day period commencing upon delivery by the Company of written notice to Parent
of such inaccuracy or breach, provided Parent continues to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach;

                  (h)      prior to the Offer Closing Date, by the Company if
the Company has proposed to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal or has approved or recommended a Superior Proposal in accordance with
Section 5.3, provided that the Company has complied with all of the provisions
of Section 5.3, including the notice provisions therein, and that simultaneously
with terminating this Agreement the Company makes all payments required to be
made to Parent pursuant to Section 8.3; or

                  (i)      prior to the Offer Closing Date, by Parent if any

thereunder) of Persons directly or indirectly acquires or agrees to acquire
beneficial or record ownership of securities representing more than fifteen
percent (15%) of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of
the Company.

         8.2      EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Except as otherwise provided in Section
8.3(d), in the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section
8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect; provided, however,
that (i) Section 6.7, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Section 9 (and the
Confidentiality Agreement) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
shall remain in full force and effect, (ii) the termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve any party from any liability for any breach of any
