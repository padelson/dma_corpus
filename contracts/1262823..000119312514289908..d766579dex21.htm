none of the Vinnolit Entities has made an election pursuant to the United
States Internal Revenue Code Section 7701 and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder to be treated as other than its default classification for U.S.
Federal Income Tax purposes within five (5) years prior to the Closing Date.

For the avoidance of doubt, any reference to the correctness, completeness,
due preparation, documentation or filing etc. (as the case may be) of certain
returns, notices, declarations or documentations (as the case may be)
contained in this Section 8.16 shall take into account the anticipated final
decision of any Tax authority or competent court to which appeals or other
legal action could potentially ultimately be filed.

     | (a) | The Purchaser explicitly acknowledges to purchase and
acquire the Shares in the condition they are in on the Closing Date based upon

determination without reliance upon any express or implied representations,
warranties or guarantees of any nature made by the Sellers except for the
guarantees explicitly given by the Sellers under this Agreement.

      | (b) | Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Purchaser acknowledges that (i) in deciding on the acquisition of the Shares
and the Business, and in determining the terms of the acquisition, the
Purchaser has not relied on, and (ii) the Sellers shall not be responsible,
and give no representation, warranty or guaranty, with respect to: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | any projections, estimates or budgets delivered or made
available to the Purchaser of future revenues, future results of operations
(or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition
(or any component thereof) or the future business operations of the Vinnolit
Entities;

representatives of the Vinnolit Entities, shall not be attributed to the
Sellers. Wherever this Agreement refers to the _Sellers  Knowledge_, this
shall mean only the actual knowledge of the individuals listed in _Schedule
8.17(c)-1_ after due inquiry with the individuals listed in _Schedule
8.17(c)-2_.  
---|---|--- 

9\. REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF SELLERS GUARANTEES

9.1 General/Recoverable damages



     | (a) | In the event of any breach or non-fulfillment by any Seller
of any of the guarantees pursuant to Section 8, such Seller shall put the
Purchaser into the position the Purchaser would have been in had the
guaranty not been breached (restitution in kind; _Naturalrestitution_ ) _._
If such Seller is unable to achieve this position within three (3) months
after having been notified by the Purchaser of the breach, the Purchaser may
claim from such Seller for monetary damages ( _Schadenersatz in Geld)_ in
accordance with German law, provided, however, that such damages shall not
cover internal administration or overhead costs of Purchaser, punitive
damages, or any arguments that the Purchase Price was calculated upon
incorrect assumptions. Damages shall, however, cover consequential damages (
_Folgesch aden_) only if and to the extent such consequential damages are
within the purpose __( _Sinn und Zweck_ ) _ _ of the relevant Sellers
Guarantee. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Each of the Sellers shall in each case only be liable for
the breach of any guarantee under Section 8 up to the pro rata damage
corresponding to the percentage of Shares it holds in the Company. The
Purchaser shall only have the right to claim damages under this Agreement for
the breach of such guarantee provided that it brings forth the respective
claim _vis- a-vis_ each of the Sellers in accordance with the _pro rata_
participation of each of the respective Sellers at the same time. This
limitation shall not apply to a breach of the guarantees set forth in Section
8.2(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) with regard to the Shares, in which case each
Seller shall be liable for a breach of these guarantees as far as the Shares
held by it are concerned.

      | (c) | The Sellers shall not be liable for, and the Purchaser
shall not be entitled to claim for, any damages of the Purchaser under or in
connection with this Agreement if and to the extent the damages are actually
recovered from a third party, including under an insurance policy. Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue all recoveries to which
Purchaser or the Vinnolit Entities may be entitled. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | The Sellers shall not be liable for, and the Purchaser shall
not be entitled to claim for, any damages based on facts and circumstances of
which the Purchaser was aware as of the Signing Date. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have been
aware of all matters disclosed in 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the documents contained in the electronic data room operated
by Data Room Services GmbH as of 26 May 2014, 12.30 CET, a copy of which will
be preserved on two CD-Roms and held in escrow by the acting notary public on
the Signing Date under a mutually agreed joint instruction letter for a period
of five (5) years from the Closing Date for purposes of providing evidence,
unless such documents do not disclose the relevant facts and circumstances in
a way so that a diligent reader of the electronic data room would reasonably
understand the matter at hand, or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | documents provided to Dave Hansen and other selected
members of the Purchasers due diligence team via a secured site which have
also been put on a third CD-Rom and are submitted to the acting notary

9.2 Overall scope of Sellers liability



     | (a) | The Sellers combined aggregate liability under this
Agreement including, but not limited to, any and all claims for breach of any
of the Sellers Guarantees pursuant to Section 8, shall be limited to a total
liability amount of EUR 20,000,000 (in words: twenty million euro). Such
limitation to EUR 20,000,000 shall not apply to the Sellers Guarantees set
forth in Sections 8.2 and 8.13 and the Sellers liability under Section
11.3, provided, however, that the total liability of the Sellers under these
provisions shall in no event exceed the Purchase Price. Each Sellers
individual liability shall be limited to such _pro rata_ portion of the
respective total liability amount that corresponds to the _pro rata_ portion
of the Purchase Price pertaining to the respective Seller. For the avoidance
of doubt: the limitations set forth in this Section 9.2(a) shall not apply in
cases of willful misconduct ( _Vorsatz_ __), __fraud __( _Betrug_ __) __or
willful deceit ( _Arglist_ ). __ 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Sellers shall not be liable for, and the Purchaser shall
not be entitled to claim for, any claims for breach of the Sellers Guarantees
under this Section 9 unless the individual claim exceeds the amount of EUR
100,000 (in words: one hundred thousand euro) (the _De Minimis Amount_ ) __and
the aggregate amount of all individual claims exceeding the De Minimis Amount
exceeds EUR 1,300,000 (in words: one million three hundred thousand euro)
(the _Threshold_ ) __ ( __ _Freibetrag_ __). __ __If the sum of individual
claims exceeding the De Minimis Amount exceeds the Threshold, the Sellers
shall only be liable, and the Purchaser shall only be entitled to claim for,
the amount exceeding the Threshold. The limitations set forth in this Section
9.2(b) shall not apply (i) to breaches of the Sellers Guarantees in Sections
8.2 and 8.13, (ii) to breaches of the non-leakage covenant in Section 11.3
and, for the avoidance of doubt, (iii) in cases of willful misconduct (
_Vorsatz_ ), fraud ( _Betrug_ ) or willful deceit ( _Arglist_ ).

and to limit the scope of any damages incurred.

9.4 Limitation periods

 

All claims for any breach of Sellers Guarantees pursuant to Section 8 above
shall become time-barred ( __ _verj ahren_ __) eighteen (18) months after

after the Closing Date; and

     | (b) | all claims of Purchaser arising as a result of wilful or
intentional breaches of Sellers obligations under this Agreement which shall
become time-barred in accordance with the statutory provisions in Sections
195, 199 of the German Civil Code. 
---|---|--- 

Section 203 of the German Civil Code shall not apply unless the relevant
Parties agree in writing that the expiry period shall be tolled ( __
_gehemmt_ __) on the basis of pending settlement negotiations. For the
avoidance of doubt, the commencement of legal proceedings (including for
declaratory judgment) shall toll the expiry period. Section 204 of the
German Civil Code shall apply.

9.5 Exclusion of further remedies

 

To the extent permitted by law, any further claims and remedies other than
explicitly provided for under Sections 8 and 9 hereof, irrespective of which
nature, amount or legal basis, are hereby expressly waived and excluded, in
particular, without limitation, claims under pre-contractual fault (Section
311 para. 2 and 3 of the German Civil Code), breach of contract __(
_Pflichtverletzung aus dem Schuldverh altnis_), frustration of contract
(Section 313 of the German Civil Code) __( _St orung der Geschaftsgrundlage_)

pursuant to Section 311 para. 1 of the German Civil Code:

 



     | (a) | No bankruptcy, insolvency or judicial composition
proceedings concerning the Purchaser or Purchasers Guarantor have been
applied for. To the Purchasers best knowledge, no circumstances exist which
would require an application for any bankruptcy, insolvency or judicial
composition proceedings nor do any circumstances exist according to any
applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws which would justify the avoidance of
this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Purchaser has sufficient immediately available funds or
binding and unconditional and irrevocable financing commitments to pay (i) the

pending against, or to the knowledge of the Purchaser and Purchasers
Guarantor, as of the Signing Date, threatened against or affecting Purchaser
and Purchasers Guarantor before any court or arbitrator or governmental
body, agency or official which in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent,
enjoin, alter or materially delay the transaction contemplated hereunder. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | Purchaser and Purchasers Guarantor do not have any
obligation or liability to pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder
or agent with respect to the transaction contemplated hereunder for which
Sellers could become wholly or partly liable. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Purchaser is acquiring the Business for investment at
Purchasers own account and neither as a nominee nor an agent. Purchaser
presently has no intention of reselling the Business. Purchaser has not
entered into any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any
person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such person or to any
third person, with respect to the Business or any part thereof. 
---|---|--- 
 

10.2 Remedies for Breach of Purchasers Guaranties



     | (a) | The Purchaser shall not be liable for, and the Sellers shall
not be entitled to claim for, any damages of the Sellers under or in
connection with this Agreement if and to the extent the damages are actually
recovered from a third party, including under an insurance policy. The
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue recoveries from
third parties to which the Sellers may be entitled. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Section 254 of the German Civil Code shall remain
unaffected, _____i.e._ __ __the Sellers are in particular obliged to prevent
the occurrence of any damages and to limit the scope of any damages incurred. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The liability of the Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.1
shall be capped at an amount of EUR 246,863,405.36 (in words: two hundred

euro and thirty-six cent). All claims of the Sellers arising under Section

11\. COVENANTS

11.1 Merger control proceedings; Other regulatory requirements

the competent merger control authorities or other governmental authorities, to
the extent they have not already been made prior to the Signing Date, will
be made within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Signing Date, unless the
applicable laws and regulations require an earlier filing. Such filings shall
be made by the Purchaser on behalf of all Parties, provided, however, that the
contents of such filings shall require prior written approval of the Sellers,
which shall not unreasonably be withheld. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall
closely cooperate in the preparation of such filings. Each Party shall without
undue delay provide all other Parties with copies of any correspondence with

contemplated by this Agreement in the shortest time period possible. The
Purchaser may waive ( _zur ucknehmen_) filings with the competent authorities
or agree with such authorities on the extension of any examination period only
with the express prior written consent of the Sellers. If the competent
authorities are prepared to grant their approval only subject to
compliance with specific conditions or obligations to be imposed upon the
Purchaser, the Purchaser shall accept the imposition of such conditions and
obligations, unless the acceptance causes Unreasonable Commercial Hardship (
_wirtschafiliche Unzumutbarkeit_ ) __for the Purchaser. For the purposes of
this Section 11.1, _Unreasonable Commercial Hardship_ shall mean where
complying with such conditions and obligations would result in an aggregate
loss of sales ( _Umsatz_ ) of at least EUR 45,000,000 of the entities of the
Vinnolit Group and the Minority Participations, the Westlake group of
companies (consisting of Purchasers Guarantor and its Affiliates and
participations) or any combination of such entities. Between the Signing Date
and the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not make any acquisitions that could
directly or indirectly delay or otherwise negatively affect the decision of
any of the competent cartel authorities to clear the transaction contemplated
hereunder. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | If on the Closing Date any merger control approval or any
other governmental consent, approval or waiver required under applicable law
in any jurisdiction (other than Austria, Poland and Turkey) in order to effect
the Closing has not been obtained, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall
consummate the Closing, provided, however, that the Sellers and the Purchaser
shall not be under an obligation to, directly or indirectly, transfer or
acquire shares or interests in respect of which the consummation of the
Closing would violate any applicable law or decision. The Sellers and the
Purchaser shall in such case agree on all appropriate measures, including
"hold separate" arrangements, regarding the shares or interests affected, in
order that the relevant jurisdiction can be exempted from the consummation of
the transaction until the required consents and approvals have been obtained. 
---|---|--- 
 

11.2 Foreign Trade Act Filing



     | (a) | The Purchaser shall, without undue delay following
notarization of this agreement, formally apply for a certificate of compliance
pursuant to Section 5 8 para. 1 AWV. In order to obtain such certificate as
soon as possible, the Parties shall co-operate with respect to the
preparation of the application and in case of any follow-up enquiries by the
BMWi.

Purchaser shall deliver the complete documentation within the meaning
of Section 57 AWV to the BMWi without undue delay. The Sellers shall use
their best efforts to support the Purchaser in this respect. In order to avoid
that the acquisition of the Shares is prohibited or otherwise restricted
pursuant to Section 4 para. 1 AWG in connection with Section 59 AWV, the
Parties shall co-operate closely in the event of any possible negotiations
with the BMWi. The Parties shall provide each other with copies of any
correspondence with the BMWi, as well as with copies of any possible written
statement, order or decision by the BMWi without undue delay. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | If the BMWi is prepared to issue a certificate of compliance
or to refrain from prohibiting the acquisition or from issuing respective
binding orders ( _Anordnungen_ ) only subject to the satisfaction of
additional conditions ( _Auflagen oder_ _Bedingungen_ ), __the Purchaser
shall be obligated to consent to such additional conditions unless it would be
economically unreasonable to expect the Purchaser to do so.

occur with regard to any Vinnolit Entity between the Signing Date up to
and including the Closing Date.

11.4 Conduct of business between the Signing Date and the Closing Date

 

Between the Signing Date and the Closing Date, the Sellers shall procure, to
the extent permissible under applicable law, that the business operations of

business and substantially in the same manner as before (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, timely filing of material Tax returns and timely payment
or withholding and remittance of declared or assessed Taxes), except (i)
where the Purchaser consents in writing to another action (provided that the
Purchasers consent shall be deemed to be granted, if the Purchaser, after
having received a request for consent, does not react to such request within
five (5) Business Days in writing) and (ii) for such measures set forth in
_Annex 11.4_. The Purchaser shall not unreasonably withhold its consent, or
withhold its consent to any action in a manner as could disrupt unreasonably
the efficient operations of any of the Vinnolit Entities. Specifically, the
Vinnolit Entities, shall not, between the Signing Date and the Closing Date,
except as set forth in Annex 11.4 without the Purchasers consent:



     | (a) | consummate any merger, spin-off or similar corporate
reorganization, or any other material restructuring of the business

Entities or redeem any of the shares in any of the Vinnolit Entities;

     | (d) | permit any of the shares in the Vinnolit Entities or their
real property or their rights equivalent to real property to be subjected to
any mortgage, pledge, lien, security, interest, encumbrance, restriction, or
charge of any kind, except for those arising by operation of law; 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | make any material capital expenditure (only projects newly
commenced in 2014) exceeding an amount of EUR 500,000 (in words: five hundred
thousand euro) or commitment thereto;

(i.e. involving obligations in excess of EUR 4,000,000 (in words: four million
euro) per annum) which are not consistent with past practice;

     | (h) | terminate or materially modify any Material Agreement;

foregoing.

The Parties agree to deal with the payment obligations of the Company under
the MBPAs as set out in _Annex 11.5_.

 

11.6 Pre-Closing restructuring



     | (a) | Sellers shall have the right on, or within 14 days after the
Closing Date, to cause the Vinnolit Entities to make elections to treat the
Company, and each subsidiary in which the Company owns more than 80% of
the outstanding stock, as disregarded entities, as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 301-7701-3, for US tax purposes, effective at a time prior
to Closing. Purchaser shall, after Closing, cause the Vinnolit Entities to
cooperate with Sellers to the extent such cooperation is reasonably requested
to make and support such elections. Sellers shall provide proof of mailing of
such elections no later than 14 days after Closing, if such elections are
made. In such case, Purchaser shall, for US tax purposes, treat the
acquisition of the Shares as a purchase of the assets of each Vinnolit Entity
for which the entity classification elections were made, and will not take an
inconsistent position in any Tax return. If the Sellers exercise such right,
the Sellers shall deliver properly executed Forms 8832 that reflect the change
in status of the entities for US Tax purposes effective no later than the day
before the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | If the Advent Funds, subject to Section 11.6(c), transfer
(by way of contribution or otherwise) their respective Shares to Vinnolit Two
S.a r.l. prior to the Closing Date, Vinnolit Two S.a r.l. hereby fully
assumes any rights and obligations of the Advent Funds under this agreement
with releasing effect ( _mit schuldbefreieinder Wirkung_ ) for the Advent
Funds. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | The Sellers shall notify Purchaser whether or not they shall
cause the Vinnolit Entities to perform the reorganization steps as set out in
Section 11.6(a) and (b) no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. In case the Sellers notify the Purchaser that they will not cause the
Vinnolit Entities to perform the reorganization, Section 11.6(a) and (b) shall
automatically fall away without any further rights or obligations of
Sellers or Purchaser resulting thereof. In such case, the Purchaser shall
have the right to make a Section 338 election under US Tax law with respect to
the acquisition of the Vinnolit Entities through the proper and timely filing
of Form 8023. If the Purchaser makes the Section 338 election, it shall
notify the Sellers of such election in a timely manner.

11.7 Purchasers post-closing undertakings

 



     | (a) | The Purchaser acknowledges that the Sellers may need access,
from time to time, after Closing to ascertain certain accounting and tax
records and information held by any of the Vinnolit Entities to the extent
such records and information pertain to events occurring or periods prior to
the Closing, and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Vinnolit Entities
to: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | properly retain and maintain such records for as long as
required under law but in any event until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date;  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | allow the Sellers, and their employees and advisors, to
inspect, review and make copies of such records as the Sellers may reasonably
deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, during normal business hours
and at the expense of the Sellers (as applicable); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | reasonably cooperate with the Sellers with a view to
collecting the relevant records and information, procure that the relevant
employees support the Sellers in collecting such information and respond to
reasonable questions of the Sellers. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Purchaser undertakes to cause each of the Vinnolit
Entities to maintain, following the Closing Date, directors and officers
liability insurance (DandO insurance) as will enable each of the persons
set forth in Annex 11.7(b) to make claims arising out of any matter, cause or
event occurring on or before the Closing Date under those policies on terms
and conditions that are, in every material respect, no less advantageous to
the covered director or officer than the policies in effect at the Signing
Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The Purchaser shall procure that the Company pays the MBPA
Base Amount (as defined in Annex 11.5) to the Management Members as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, provided that the Company has
either received the Seller MBPA Contribution or the Purchaser MBPA
Contribution has been satisfied and extinguished as stipulated in Section
6.3(d) and Annex 11.5.

12\. CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRESS RELEASES

 

12.1 Confidentiality; press releases; public disclosure

 

The Parties mutually undertake to keep the contents of this Agreement secret
and confidential vis-a-vis any third party except to the extent that
the relevant facts are publicly known or disclosure is required by law or by
applicable stock exchange regulations. In such case, the Parties shall,
however, inform each other prior to such disclosure and shall limit any
disclosure to the minimum required by statute or the authorities. No press
releases or other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be made by any Party unless the form and text of such

publicly known through no fault of the Sellers or which the Sellers are
required to disclose as necessary to comply with any legal requirements.

 

12.3 Purchasers Confidentiality; return of documents

 

Up until the Closing and in the unlikely event that this Agreement is
terminated without the Closing having been consummated, the Purchaser and
the Purchasers Guarantor undertake to keep confidential all information
received from the Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and, should Closing not occur, to return all documents and
information embodied otherwise which they received from the Sellers, together
with any copies thereof and to destroy all documents and information embodied
otherwise it produced based on information received from the Sellers, unless
such information is in the public domain without breach of a confidentiality
obligation towards the Sellers. The Purchaser and the Purchasers Guarantor
shall not be entitled to any retention right with respect to such documents or
information in case Closing does not occur, except if the Closing did not
occur due to a breach of covenant by any Seller, in which case Purchaser and
Purchasers Guarantor shall be entitled to retain such documents in order to
be able to pursue their respective rights in any legal proceeding.
