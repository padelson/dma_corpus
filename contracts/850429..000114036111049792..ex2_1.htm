ARTICLE II

  

  

PURCHASE AND SALE OF INTERESTS

  

  

2.1 Purchase and Sale of the Interests. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer and convey to the Buyer, free and clear of any Liens, and the Buyer
shall purchase and acquire all of the Interests owned by the Seller from the
Seller (and the Seller shall cause the assignment, transfer and conveyance of
the Quota to Tac II), in exchange for cash consideration equal to the Purchase
Price.

  

  

2.2 Calculation of Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) Estimated Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Interests (the
"Purchase Price") shall be $188,000,000 (the "Base Consideration") plus the
Adjustment Amount (if the Adjustment Amount is a positive number) or minus the
absolute value of the Adjustment Amount (if it is a negative number). At the
Closing, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to:

  

  

(i) the Base Consideration plus the Estimated Adjustment Amount (if the
Estimated Adjustment Amount is a positive number) or minus the absolute value
of the Estimated Adjustment Amount (if it is a negative number) (the
"Estimated Purchase Price"); minus

  

  

(ii) the sum of the Holdback Amount, the Escrow Amount and the Second Escrow
Amount.

  

  

The Estimated Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment following the
Closing pursuant to Section 2.3.

  

  

(b) Pre-Closing Statement and Transaction Expenses. Not fewer than two
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, (i) the Seller shall
deliver to the Buyer a certificate executed by an officer of the Seller (the
"Pre-Closing Statement") setting forth the Seller's good faith estimates of
(A) Closing Indebtedness, (B) Transaction Expenses, (C) Net Working Capital,
(D) Funded CapEx and (E) the Adjustment Amount, in each case determined in
accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules (clause (E) being the "Estimated
Adjustment Amount"), together with supporting documentation for such estimates
and any additional information reasonably requested by the Buyer, and (ii) the
Seller shall deliver to the Buyer final invoices with respect to all
Transaction Expenses to be paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at
the Closing, to the extent such invoices are made available to the Seller at
such time (the "Closing Transaction Expenses"). The Pre-Closing Statement
shall be prepared in consultation with the Buyer and be subject to its
approval, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Holdback. A portion of the Purchase Price in an amount equal to (i)
$4,000,000 if Net Working Capital as set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement is
less than $13,000,000 or (ii) $3,000,000 if Net Working Capital as set forth
in the Pre-Closing Statement is $13,000,000 or more (in either case, such
amount, the "Holdback Amount") shall be held by Buyer on the Closing Date as
security for the Seller's obligations under Section 2.3 and distributed or
deducted in accordance with Section 2.3(d).

  

  

(d) Escrow Amount. The Buyer shall deposit a portion of the Purchase Price in
an amount equal to $36,850,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds
into two non-interest bearing escrow accounts (the first such account, the
"Escrow Account," and the second such account, the "Second Escrow Account")
established by the Buyer and the Seller with JPMorgan Chase (the "Escrow
Agent"), such amount to be allocated between the Escrow Account and the Second
Escrow Account (as so allocated, the "Escrow Amount" and the "Second Escrow
Amount," respectively) in accordance with two escrow agreements, each in the
form previously agreed by the parties hereto (such agreements, the "Escrow
Agreement" and the "Second Escrow Agreement," respectively). The Escrow Amount
and the Second Escrow Amount will be disbursed from the Escrow Account or the
Second Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of
Section 11.6 of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Second Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

2.3 Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Closing Statement. Within 60 days following the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a certificate executed by an executive
officer of the Buyer (the "Closing Statement") setting forth the Buyer's
determination of (i) Closing Indebtedness, (ii) Transaction Expenses, (iii)
Net Working Capital, (iv) Funded CapEx and (v) the Adjustment Amount, in each
case determined in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules. Following delivery
of the Closing Statement, the Buyer shall provide the Seller with access to
any supporting documentation for the Closing Statement that the Seller may
reasonably request.

  

  

(b) Dispute Resolution. Within 15 days after the Seller's receipt of the
Closing Statement, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a written statement
either accepting the Closing Statement or specifying any objections thereto in
reasonable detail (an "Objections Statement"). If the Seller does not deliver
an Objections Statement within such 15-day period, then the Closing Statement
shall become final and binding upon all parties. If the Seller does deliver an
Objections Statement within such 15-day period, then the Seller and the Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith for 10 days following the Buyer's receipt of
such Objections Statement to resolve such objections (any unresolved
objection, a "Dispute"). After such 10-day period, any item or matter set
forth in the Closing Statement that is not a Dispute shall become final and
binding upon all parties. If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve
all objections during such 10-day period, then any remaining Disputes, and
only such remaining Disputes, shall be resolved by Ernst and Young LLP or, if
such firm is not able or willing to serve in such capacity, another nationally
ranked firm upon which the Buyer and Seller shall agree (the "Accounting
Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to resolve any such remaining
Disputes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement within 30 days after
its appointment. The resolution of such Disputes by the Accounting Firm (i)
shall be set forth in writing, (ii) shall be within the range of dispute
between the Buyer and the Seller, (iii) shall constitute an arbitral award,
and (iv) shall be conclusive and binding upon all the parties upon which a
judgment may be rendered by a court having proper jurisdiction. Upon delivery
of such resolution, the Closing Statement, as modified in accordance with such
resolution, shall become final and binding upon all parties.

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Fees and Expenses of Accounting Firm. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the
Disputes not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by
such party. For example, if the Seller claims that the appropriate adjustments
are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Buyer and if the
Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the Dispute by awarding to the Seller $300
of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm will be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to the Buyer and 70% (i.e., 700
÷ 1,000) to the Seller.

  

  

(d) Final Adjustment Amount. As used herein, "Final Adjustment Amount" means
(i) if the Seller fails to deliver an Objections Statement in accordance with
Section 2.3(b), the Adjustment Amount as set forth in the Closing Statement,
or (ii) if the Adjustment Amount is resolved by resolution of the Buyer and
the Seller or by submission of any remaining Disputes to the Accounting Firm,
as contemplated by Section 2.3(b), the Adjustment Amount as so resolved. If
the Final Adjustment Amount is greater than the Estimated Adjustment Amount
(the amount of such excess, the "Adjustment Excess"), then the Buyer shall
deliver to the Seller the Adjustment Excess and the Holdback Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by the Seller in writing. If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than the
Estimated Adjustment Amount (the absolute amount of such shortfall, the
"Adjustment Shortfall"), and (x) the Holdback Amount is greater than the
Adjustment Shortfall (the amount of such excess, the "Holdback Excess"), then
the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller the Holdback Excess by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Seller
in writing, and the Buyer shall retain the remainder of the Holdback Amount
equal to the Adjustment Shortfall, and (y) if the Holdback Amount is less than
the Adjustment Shortfall (the absolute amount of such shortfall, the "Holdback
Shortfall"), the Buyer, at its option, (x) may require the Seller to deliver
to the Buyer the Holdback Shortfall by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more accounts designated by the Buyer in writing or (y) may
(but, for the avoidance of doubt, is not required to) recover the Holdback
Shortfall from the Escrow Amount pursuant to the procedures set forth in the
Escrow Agreement, and in either case, the Buyer shall retain the entire
Holdback Amount. All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) shall be
made with 15 Business Days of the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount
and, if such payment is made more than 90 calendar days after the Closing
Date, shall be paid together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to
the date of payment at an interest rate per annum equal to three percent (3%).
All computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days,
in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is
payable. Whenever any payment under this Section 2.3(d) shall be due on a day
other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall be included in the computation
of, and payment of, interest. All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.3
shall be treated by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the
Purchase Price.

11.2 Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of the
Buyer or its Affiliates or any information the Buyer or its Affiliates may
have, the Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, managers, members, agents and
other representatives, against any loss, liability, obligation, damage, claim,
cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and taxes
and penalties) (collectively, "Losses") arising from or relating to: (i) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Seller's representations and warranties
set forth in Article IV or Article V of this Agreement; (ii) any breach or
nonperformance of the covenants and agreements of the Seller contained in this
Agreement, in each case, subject to Sections 11.1 and 11.4; (iii) any Taxes

officers of the Company or any of it Subsidiaries or other Persons entitled to
indemnification from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective predecessors), other than those directors, managers or officers or
other Persons who continue in such or other capacities with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries after Closing, arising from their service as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to

Law; (vii) any Taxes with respect to the matter described in item 6 of

Issuer to the Seller or an Affiliate of Seller pursuant to Section 7.12(a);
and (ix) the matter set forth on Schedule 11.2(a).

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

57

Affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries) against any Losses
arising from or relating to the matters described in items 3 through 6 of
Schedule 5.6(a).

  

  

(c) Regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of the
Seller or its Affiliates or any information the Seller or its Affiliates may
have, the Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its
Affiliates (not including the Company or its Subsidiaries) and their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, managers, members,
agents and other representatives, against any Losses that result, directly or
indirectly, from (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Buyer's
representations and warranties set forth in Article VI of this Agreement; and
(ii) any breach or nonperformance of the covenants and agreements of the Buyer
contained in this Agreement, in each case, subject to Sections 11.1 and 11.4.

  

  

11.3 Indemnification Procedure.

  

  

(a) If a party entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnified Party")
learns of any matter that it believes will entitle such Indemnified Party to
indemnification from the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be, under
Section 11.2 (the "Indemnifying Party"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver
to the Indemnifying Party a notice describing such matter in reasonable
detail, including the nature of the claim, the basis for the indemnification
obligation, to the extent reasonably estimable, the estimated losses resulting
therefrom, and reasonable supporting documentation (a "Notice of Claim"). If
the Notice of Claim involves a third party claim, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver the Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party within the shorter of
(i) 90 days after the date on which the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the
claim related to the Loss or (ii) one-third of the time period commencing on
the date on which the Indemnified Party became aware of the claim related to
the Loss and ending on the third Business Day preceding the date by which the
appropriate defense must be presented as provided below.

  

  

(b) If any indemnification claim involves a third party claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof within the
shorter of (x) 30 days after the Notice of Claim has been delivered to the
Indemnifying Party or (y) two-thirds of the time period commencing on the date
on which the Indemnified Party became aware of the claim related to the Loss
and ending on the third Business Day preceding the date by which the
appropriate defense must be presented as provided below (provided that any
failure of the Indemnified Party to provide timely Notice of Claim shall not
affect the Indemnifying Party's right to assume the defense of any such third
party claim), in either case with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's sole expense, except that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or continue control of the
defense of any third party claim if (i) the claim involves criminal liability,
(ii) the claim seeks exclusively an injunction or equitable relief against any
Indemnified Party, (iii) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to
defend the claim in good faith or (iv) the claim relates to any of items 3
through 6 of Schedule 5.6(a) that are the subject of indemnification pursuant
to Section 11.2(b). During the period referred to in the preceding sentence,
the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective officers and directors to, provide such information to the
Indemnifying Party as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in
connection with its evaluation of whether a third party claim is an
indemnifiable claim under Section 11.2. Notwithstanding the assumption of the
defense of any claim by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate legal counsel and to participate in the
defense of such claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable
fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such separate legal counsel to the
Indemnified Party if (and only if): (x) the Indemnifying Party shall have
agreed to pay such fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, (y) in the written
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party a conflict of interest arises out
of the representation of the interests of such Indemnified Party by counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party or (z) the Indemnifying Party shall have
failed to employ legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party within a reasonable period of time after the Notice of Claim. If the
Indemnified Party employs separate legal counsel in circumstances other than
as described in the preceding clauses (x), (y) or (z), the fees, costs and
expenses of such legal counsel shall be borne exclusively by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not in connection with each third party
claim be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of legal
counsel for all of the Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party (having
assumed the defense of a third party claim) or the Indemnified Party (having
proceeded with its own defense of a third party claim in accordance with this
Section 11.3) proposes to settle such third party claim, the Indemnifying
Party or the Indemnified Party (as applicable) shall provide notice to that
effect (together with a reasonably detailed statement of the terms and
conditions of such settlement) to the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying
Party (as applicable), which notice shall be provided a reasonable time prior
to the proposed time for effecting such settlement, and shall not effect any
such settlement without the prior consent of the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party (as applicable), which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
consent of the Indemnified Party shall be required if the related settlement
does not entail any admission of liability on the part of any Indemnified
Party and provides for the full release of the Indemnified Party from any and
all liability in respect of such third party claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall be solely responsible for any amounts payable under any such settlement
agreement, as Losses of the Indemnified Party.

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If an Indemnified Party suffers an indemnifiable Loss that does not
involve a third-party claim, the Indemnified Party shall inform the
Indemnifying Party in writing thereof with a Notice of Claim, and upon receipt
of such Notice of Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly inform the
Indemnified Party about its agreement or disagreement with respect to the
notified Loss. If the Loss is subject to dispute, such dispute shall be
considered as a dispute according to the terms of this Agreement and shall be
resolved as provided for in Section 12.9 below. If there is no dispute on the
Notice of Claim or, in case of a dispute, if the Loss is deemed to be due
after the procedures described in Section 12.9 below, the Indemnifying Party
shall, within ten (10) Business Days, pay for the Loss in immediately
available funds, to the bank, branch and checking account indicated in advance
and in writing by the Indemnified Party (except as otherwise contemplated by
Section 11.6).

  

  

11.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

  

  

(a) The Seller shall have no liability for any Losses under clause (i) and
clause (iii) of Section 11.2(a) (other than for Losses incurred as a result of
inaccuracies of the representations and warranties contained in the Seller
Fundamental Representations, as to which this clause (a) shall have no effect)
unless and until the aggregate amount of the Losses for which the Seller is
obligated to indemnify pursuant to clause (i) and clause (iii) of Section
11.2(a) shall exceed $1,000,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), in which case the
Seller shall only be liable for the amount of Losses sought by the Buyer in
excess of the Threshold Amount. The aggregate liability of the Seller for all
Losses under Section 11.2(a) shall not exceed the Escrow Amount, as specified
in Section 11.6. The aggregate liability of the Seller for all Losses under
Section 11.2(b) shall not exceed the Second Escrow Amount and (if and to the
extent permitted by the Escrow Agreement) the Escrow Amount, as specified in
Section 11.6.

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any amounts
payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall
be paid without duplication and in no event shall (i) any Indemnifying Party
be obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses
with respect to any matter to the extent such matter was taken into account in
the Adjustment Amount pursuant to Sections 2.2(b) and 2.3; (ii) any
Indemnified Party be indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement
for the same Losses; and (iii) the Seller be obligated to indemnify the Buyer
with respect to any Losses incurred by the Buyer relating to actions taken by
the Seller in accordance with Sections 7.2(g) and 7.2(h).

  

  

(c) Amounts in respect of any Losses payable by any Indemnifying Party
pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be
reduced by (i) any amounts actually received from third parties by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party (including applicable insurance proceeds) and
(ii) any tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party (such amounts
and benefits are collectively referred to herein as "Indemnity Reduction
Amounts"). For purposes of this Section 11.4(c), a tax benefit shall not be
treated as actually realized until it has reduced the amount of Taxes actually
paid by the Indemnified Party. If any Indemnified Party receives any Indemnity
Reduction Amounts in respect of a claim for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement after the full amount of such claim has been paid by an
Indemnifying Party or after an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment
of such claim and such Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid
balance of such claim, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (x) the amount
theretofore paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim, less (y)
the amount of the indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity
Reduction Amounts in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity
payment was made. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not intended that any
insurer be released from any obligation or liability that it otherwise would
have had under any of the Company Insurance Policies set forth on Schedule
5.16(a) as a result of the indemnification provisions of this Agreement or be
entitled to any rights of subrogation in relation to any party's rights under
this Agreement as a result of any claims paid or payable by such insurer under
any of the Company Insurance Policies set forth on Schedule 5.16(a).

  

  

(d) Each of the Seller and the Buyer, as appropriate, shall, or shall cause
each Indemnified Party to, use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
Losses for which indemnification is available under this Article XI and shall
act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with such claims.

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

11.5 Exclusive Remedy. Except for any claim for intentional fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, and except for remedies of specific performance
and injunctive or other equitable relief, following the Closing, the
provisions of this Article XI (and, with respect to the Buyer, the RandW
Insurance Policy) shall be the sole and exclusive remedies for any and all
claims arising out of or relating to any of the items listed in Section 11.2,
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be
sought to be imposed, whether in contract or tort, or whether at law or in
equity, or otherwise, and the Indemnified Parties shall have no other remedy
or recourse with respect any of the forgoing other than pursuant and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Article XI (and, with respect to the
Buyer, the RandW Insurance Policy).

  

  

11.6 Recourse. Buyer (on its behalf or on behalf of the other Indemnified
Parties described in Section 11.2(a)) may seek satisfaction of any claim
brought under this Article XI (other than with respect to Section 11.2(b)) in
whole or in part only (i) first, by a claim against the Escrow Account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and (ii) when the Escrow Account funds
have been depleted or have been released in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, against the RandW Insurance Policy. Buyer (on its behalf or on behalf
of the other Indemnified Parties described in Section 11.2(b)) may seek
satisfaction of any claim brought under Section 11.2(b) in whole or in part
only (i) first, by a claim against the Second Escrow Account in accordance
with the Second Escrow Agreement and (ii) then, if the Second Escrow Account
funds have been depleted or have been released to the Buyer in accordance with
the Second Escrow Agreement, by a claim against the Escrow Account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement (if and to the extent permitted thereby).

  

  

11.7 Effect on Purchase Price. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any
amounts payable under this Article XI shall be treated by the Buyer and the
Seller as adjustments to the Purchase Price (including for all Tax purposes).

  

  

11.8 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Straddle Period. In the case of any taxable period of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined (i) as to
income, receipts or similar Taxes, based on an interim closing of the books as
of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the
taxable period of any partnership or other pass through entity in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed
to terminate at such time), and (ii) as to all other Taxes, based on a daily
proration. For purposes of any Taxes determined based on a daily proration
basis, the amount of such Taxes allocated to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
the full, actual amount of such Taxes multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on (and including) the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period.

  

  

(b) Tax Returns.

  

  

(i) The Seller shall prepare and file timely, or cause to be prepared and
filed timely, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or for the Company and
its Subsidiaries on or after the date of this Agreement and on or before the
Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Returns"). All such Pre-Closing Tax Returns
shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior practice, except
as required by applicable Tax Law. The Seller shall permit the Buyer to review
and comment on each such Pre-Closing Tax Return (or the allocable portions of
such Pre-Closing Tax Returns that include the Company and its Subsidiaries) at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the filing of such Pre-Closing Tax
Return. If any such Pre-Closing Tax Returns could reasonably be expected to
result in an increase in the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' Tax
liability for the taxable periods (or portions thereof) after the Closing
Date, then the Seller shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as the
Buyer reasonably requests.

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The Buyer shall prepare and file timely, or cause to be prepared and
filed timely, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or for the Company and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period ("Post-Closing Tax Returns"). All such Post-Closing Tax Returns shall
be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior practice, except as
required by applicable Tax Law. The Buyer shall permit the Seller to review
and comment on each such Post-Closing Tax Return (or the allocable portions of
such Post-Closing Tax Return that include the Company and its Subsidiaries) at
least thirty (30) days prior to the filing of such Post-Closing Tax Return,
and the Buyer shall make any revisions to such Post-Closing Tax Return
reasonably requested by the Seller (but, in the case of a Tax Return with
respect to a Straddle Period, only to the extent such revisions relate to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period), to the extent not inconsistent with the requirements
of the preceding sentence.

  

  

(iii) The Seller and the Buyer shall not (and the Buyer shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries not to) amend, without the other party's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed, a Tax Return to which this Section 11.8(b) applies.

  

  

(iv) If the Seller or the Buyer cannot agree as to any revisions of a Tax
Return to be filed under Sections 11.8(b)(i) or (ii), then at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the filing date of such Tax Return (including
applicable extensions) any disputed item shall be resolved (within a
reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such Tax Return)
by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen by both the
Buyer and the Seller. Upon resolution of all disputed items, the relevant Tax
Return shall be filed on that basis. The costs, fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller.

  

  

(c) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Seller and the Buyer shall (and Buyer
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to) cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by another party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 11.8(c) and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other party's request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees and, as applicable, outside Tax advisors available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. The Seller and the Buyer shall (and Buyer
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to) agree to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by the Seller, the Company or the Buyer, any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any taxing authority. The Seller and the Buyer
shall (and the Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to), upon
request, use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller and the Buyer shall
(and the Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to), upon request,
provide the other party with all information that may be required to report
pursuant to Code § 6043A or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller
agrees to cooperate with the Buyer (and the Buyer agrees to reimburse the
Seller's reasonable, out-of-pocket, third party expenses in connection with
such cooperation upon receipt of an invoice (or invoices) documenting such
expenses) with respect to reasonable requests of the Buyer in connection with
responding to any notices or obtaining any relief under the Treasury
Regulations section 301.9100-3 (or other applicable sections of the Code or
Treasury Regulations), as applicable, with respect to or related to Forms 8832
for the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Contest Provisions.

  

  

(i) In the event the Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
receives notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment or other
dispute concerning Taxes with respect to which the Seller may incur liability
pursuant to the indemnifications provisions of Section 11.2(a) (any such
audit, assessment or other dispute, a "Contest"), the Buyer shall notify the
Seller promptly of such Contest pursuant to a Notice of Claim; provided that
failure of the Buyer to comply with this provision shall not affect the
Buyer's right to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI unless such
failure materially adversely affects the ability of the Seller to challenge
such Contest. In the event the Seller or any of its Affiliates receives notice
of any pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment or other dispute concerning
Taxes with respect to THC in respect of taxable periods during which Tinc and
THC were members of the same affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or
aggregate group (any such audit, assessment or other dispute, a "THC Tax
Contest"), the Seller shall notify the Buyer promptly of such THC Tax Contest
pursuant to a Notice of Claim. The Buyer shall have the right to participate
(at its own expense) in any such THC Tax Contest. Seller shall keep the Buyer
reasonably informed of the details and status of such THC Tax Contest
(including providing the Buyer with copies of all written correspondence
regarding such THC Tax Contest). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller
shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any such THC Tax Contest that would increase the
liability for Taxes of the Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any period without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The Seller shall control any Contest that relates to any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date, and shall be entitled to employ counsel
of its choice at the Seller's expense; provided that (x) the Buyer shall have
the right to participate (at its own expense) in any such Contest and (y) the
Seller shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed of the details and status of
such Contest (including providing the Buyer with copies of all written
correspondence regarding such Contest). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Seller shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any such Contest that would increase the liability
for Taxes of the Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
period beginning on or after the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed. If the Seller fails to assume control of the conduct of
any such Contest within a reasonable period following the receipt by the Buyer
of notice of such Contest, the Buyer shall have the right to assume control of
such Contest; provided, however, that Buyer shall not settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any such Contest
without the prior written consent of the Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(iii) The Buyer shall control any Contest that relates to any taxable period
including (but not ending on) the Closing Date and shall be entitled to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense; provided, that (x) the Seller shall have
the right to participate (at its own expense) in any such Contest; (y) the
Buyer shall keep the Seller reasonably informed of the details and status of
such Contest (including providing the Seller with copies of all written
correspondence regarding such Contest); and (z) with the written consent of
the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, the Seller may assume control of the conduct of such Contest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall not be entitled to settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any such
Contest that would increase the liability for Taxes of the Seller without the
prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed; provided, however, that such consent shall
not be required to the extent that the Buyer directly pays such additional
amounts owed by the other party, if any, and agrees in writing with the other
party not to seek indemnity from the other party against the effects of such
settlement. If the Buyer fails to assume control of the conduct of any such
Contest within a reasonable period following the receipt by the Buyer of
notice of such Contest, the Seller shall have the right to assume control of
such Contest; provided, however, that Seller shall not settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any such Contest
without the prior written consent of the Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(iv) To the extent that it conflicts with Section 11.3(b), the provisions of
this Section 11.8(d) shall control with respect to all Contests.

  

  

(e) Termination of Existing Tax-Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax
sharing agreements or arrangements, written or oral, between the Seller and/or
an Affiliate of the Seller (including Co-Issuer but excluding the Company and
any of its other Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company (other than Co-Issuer), on the other hand, shall
terminate as of the Closing Date and after the Closing Date, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder
(whether for the current year, a future year, or a past year).

   
 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Transfer Taxes and Fees. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including, as to any such Taxes, fees, or charges,
any penalties and interest) incurred by Buyer, the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be included in the Transaction Expenses.

the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such Action and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action in any such

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

12.11 Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton and Garrison LLP has represented the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
parties to this Agreement recognize the community of interest that exists and
will continue to exist until the Closing, and the parties agree that such
community of interest should continue to be recognized after the Closing.
Specifically, the parties agree that (a) the Buyer shall not, and from and
after the Closing shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to not, seek to
have Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP disqualified from
representing the Seller in any dispute (whether in contract or tort) that may
arise between the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer or, from and after
the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other, based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby in whole or in part and (b) in connection with any dispute
that may arise between the Seller, on the one hand, the Buyer or, from and
after the Closing, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
successors, stockholders, employees, officers, partners, members, trustees,
directors, managers, agents and representatives, on the other, the Seller (and
not the Company) shall have the right to decide whether or not to waive any
attorney-client privilege that may apply to any communications between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and
Garrison LLP that occurred on or prior to the Closing. The covenants contained
in this Section 12.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Seller and its Affiliates and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which it is entitled, whether pursuant to
Law, Contract or otherwise.

  

  

12.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the Buyer and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

  

  

12.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts
with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon a
single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an
original of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when, and
only when, each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed
by all of the other parties hereto.
