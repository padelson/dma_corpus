For the avoidance of doubt, Base Revenue for purposes of calculating the Earn-

$400,000,000, then the Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration shall be
$6,666,666 for all past, present and subsequent Earn-Out Periods. Sample
calculations of Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration are set out in the
Schedule of Sample Calculations.

 



 

(b) _Reporting_. No later than the 20th day following the earlier to occur of
(1) the 10th day following the due date for the filing of Parents Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year in which the Earn-Out Period ends, or
(2) the actual filing date of such Annual Report on Form 10-K, Acquiror shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a report showing the Earn-Out Revenue and the
resulting Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration (the " _Report_ "). For a
period of 30 days after receipt of such Report, Seller shall have the right,
at Sellers expense and upon not less than five days prior notice to Acquiror,
to (a) meet with Acquiror to discuss Acquirors calculations, and (b) have
reasonable access, including in electronic form, during normal business hours
to inspect the records, working papers, schedules and other documentation used
or prepared by Acquiror in connection with the preparation of such
calculations, in any such case solely for the purpose of verifying such
calculations. Unless Seller gives notice of its disagreement (a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") with Acquirors calculations, detailing the amount, nature and
detailed basis of such dispute, based on the facts known by Seller at the
time, within 30 days after the delivery of the Report, Acquirors calculations
shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of timely delivery of the Dispute
Notice, Acquiror and Seller shall first use diligent good faith efforts to
resolve such dispute. If they are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days
after delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the dispute shall be submitted to a
mutually agreeable independent, nationally recognized United States accounting
firm (which need not be one of the "big four" accounting firms, but shall not
be Ernst and Young LLP or Parents then-current independent auditor) which firm
shall select one of its partners (the " _Arbitrator_ ") to determine matters
in dispute. If Acquiror and Seller cannot agree the accounting firm to select
the Arbitrator, Acquiror and Seller shall request JAMS to appoint such firm,
and such appointment shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties.
Acquiror and Seller shall instruct the Arbitrator to make a decision as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than 30 days after acceptance of
such appointment. Acquiror and Seller shall enter into any engagement letter
reasonably required by the Arbitrator to perform the Arbitrators services
hereunder. A determination by the Arbitrator as to the resolution of any
dispute (including all procedural matters) shall be binding and conclusive
upon the parties. A judgment of the determination made by the Arbitrator
pursuant to this paragraph may be entered into and enforced by any court
having jurisdiction thereover. Seller and Acquiror shall each bear their own
fees and expenses in connection with any such dispute. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Arbitrator shall be allocated to and borne by the Acquiror
based on the percentage that the Arbitrators award in favor of Seller bears
to the total disputed amount, and the remainder of such fees, costs and
expenses shall be borne by Seller.

 



 

(d) _Earn-Out Distributions_. If Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration set
forth in the Report is greater than $0, then Acquiror shall pay the Earn-Out
Period Additional Consideration to Sellers Bank Account (subject to the terms
of the Agreement, including Section 9 thereof) on or prior to the 5th day (the
" _Distribution Deadline_ ") following the delivery of the Report; provided,
however, that if there is a Dispute Notice, then the portion of the Earn-Out
Period Additional Consideration that would be payable with respect to the
amount in dispute shall be paid, if at all, on or prior to the 10th day
following the final resolution of all disputes pursuant to Section 2.4(c). If
Earn-Out Revenue in any particular Earn-Out Period equals at least
$400,000,000, then the Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration of $6,666,666
for all past, present and subsequent Earn-Out Periods shall be paid out
promptly in an amount equal to $33,333,330 less any Earn-Out Period Additional
Consideration already paid. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the
Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration shall be reduced by the Departure
Percentage that is applicable at the time of the payment of the Earn-Out
Period Additional Consideration. Seller covenants that any reduction
attributable to the Departure Percentage shall be borne exclusively by
Northzone Ventures VI L.P. and Investinor AS through corresponding reductions
of liquidation proceeds or otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Earn-Out Calculations_. All calculations of revenues shall eliminate
inter-company transactions within Parent Group as required by GAAP such that
the revenues shall be based only on transactions between Parent Group and any
third party. Whenever Earn-Out Products are sold in combination with other
products of Parent Group, the amount of Earn-Out Revenue (or Base Revenue)
attributable to the Earn-Out Products shall be reasonably determined by
Acquiror. All determinations of Earn-Out Revenue and Base Revenue (" _Target
Performance Metrics_ ") shall be determined in accordance with GAAP applied in
the same manner, and using the same accounting policies and methodologies, as
such principles are applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in its annual report on Form 10-K, as filed by Parent with the SEC.

 



 

(f) _Earn-Out Standard_. Parent and Acquiror shall not act in bad faith to
take any action which has as its purpose to prevent, reduce or postpone
payment of the Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration. Subject to the
foregoing sentence, Parent and Acquiror shall be free to operate the business
in the manner Parent and Acquiror deem to be in the interest of Parent and
Acquiror and Parents stockholders.

 



 

(g) _Sale of Target_. In the event that, prior to January 1, 2019, the Parent
Group sells a material portion of the Target Business and/or the Parent
Groups business involved in the development, manufacturing or sale of Earn-
Out Products, Acquiror and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to adjust the
provisions of this Section 2.4 appropriately to the extent required to put
Parent Group and Seller in substantially the same positions as if such sale
had not occurred. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) the preceding sentence shall
not apply to a sale of the Parent Group and (b) in no event shall any such
adjustment increase the maximum Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration
otherwise payable hereunder.

 



 

2.5 _Post-Closing Objection to Net Working Capital Amount_.

 



 

(a) Until the 45th day following the Closing Date, Acquiror shall have the
right to give notice of its disagreement (by delivery of written notice to
Seller within such 45-day period) (a " _Net Working Capital Dispute Notice_ ")
with Targets calculations of the Net Working Capital and any items included
therein, detailing the amount, nature and basis of such dispute. In the event
of such a dispute and delivery of the Net Working Capital Dispute Notice,
Acquiror and Seller shall first use diligent good faith efforts to resolve
such dispute. If they are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days after
delivery of the Net Working Capital Dispute Notice, then the dispute shall be
submitted to the Arbitrator to determine matters in dispute. Acquiror and
Seller shall instruct the Arbitrator to make a decision as promptly as
practicable but in no event later than 30 days after acceptance of such
appointment. Acquiror and Seller shall enter into any engagement letter
reasonably required by the Arbitrator to perform the Arbitrators services
hereunder. A determination by the Arbitrator as to the resolution of any
dispute (including all procedural matters) shall be binding and conclusive
upon the parties. A judgment of the determination made by the Arbitrator
pursuant to this paragraph may be entered into and enforced by any court
having jurisdiction thereover. Seller and Acquiror shall each bear their own
fees and expenses in connection with any such dispute. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Arbitrator shall be allocated to and borne by Acquiror based
on the percentage that the Arbitrators award in favor of Seller bears to the
total disputed amount, and the remainder of such fees, costs and expenses
shall be borne by Seller.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If Acquiror does not deliver a Net Working Capital Dispute Notice to
Seller prior to the expiration of the 45-day period after the Closing Date,
the Targets calculation of the Net Working Capital and each item contained
therein shall be deemed final and binding on all parties for purposes of
calculating the Net Working Capital under this Agreement. If the Net Working
Capital as used in the calculation of the Initial Cash Consideration is (i)
less than the Net Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.5, then Acquiror shall pay the amount of such earlier Net
Working Capital deficiency (from dollar one) to Sellers Bank Account (such
amount, the " _Deficiency Adjustment Amount_ "), or (ii) greater than the Net
Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.5,
then Acquiror shall be entitled to receive the amount of such earlier Net
Working Capital excess payment (from dollar one) from the Holdback Amount
(such amount, the " _Excess Adjustment Amount_ "), and thereafter the Net
Working Capital as so finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.5
and each item contained therein shall be deemed final and binding on all
parties for purposes of calculating the Net Working Capital under this
Agreement.

 



 

2.6 _Payment_. Seller acknowledge that any payment made to Sellers Bank
Account pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute full satisfaction of
Acquirors obligation to pay such amount to Seller. Payments to Sellers Bank
Account shall be by wire transfer of immediate available funds.

3.14 _Inventory_. The inventories shown on the Net Working Capital Certificate
were acquired and maintained in the ordinary course of business, are of good
and merchantable quality, and consist of items of a quantity and quality
usable or salable in the ordinary course of business, net of any provisions
made in this respect in the Net Working Capital Certificate. Since the Target
Balance Sheet Date, Target has continued to replenish inventories
substantially in a normal and customary manner consistent with past practices.
Target has not received notice that it will experience in the foreseeable
future any difficulty in obtaining, in the desired quantity and quality, the
raw materials, supplies or component products required for the manufacture,
assembly or production of Target Products. The values at which inventories are
carried reflect the inventory valuation policy of Target, which is consistent
with its past practice and in accordance with Norwegian GAAP. Target has no
unrecorded Liabilities with respect to the return of any item of inventory in
the possession of distributors, wholesalers, retailers or other Customers.
Adequate provision has been made in the Net Working Capital Certificate and on
the books of Target in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices to provide for all slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventories to
their estimated useful or scrap values, and such inventory reserves are
adequate to provide for such slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventory and
inventory shrinkage, all to the extent required by Norwegian GAAP.

 



 

3.15 _Accounts Receivable_. The accounts receivable reflected in the Net
Working Capital Certificate are valid and genuine, have arisen solely out of
bona fide sales and deliveries of goods, performance of services, and other
business transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices in each case with Persons other than affiliates, are not subject to
any prior assignment or Encumbrance, are not subject to valid defenses, set-
offs or counter claims and are collectible.

 



 

3.16 _Customers and Suppliers_. Section 3.16 of the Target Disclosure Schedule

top 10 distributors and contract manufacturers purchasing from Target for the

End Customers of Target for the year-ended December 31, 2012, and (b) payments

(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule and no supplier of Target or its
Subsidiaries (a) has canceled or otherwise terminated, or, to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened to cancel or otherwise terminate, its relationship with
Target, or (b) has decreased materially, or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened
to decrease materially, its services or supplies to Target in the case of any
such supplier, or its usage of Targets services or its purchase of Target
Products. Target has not engaged in any Fraud with respect to Acquiror or any
Customer or supplier of Target.

 



      
 

 



 

3.17 _Title to Property_. Target has good and marketable title to all of its
properties, interests in properties and tangible assets, real and personal,

Sheet Date (except properties, interests in properties and assets sold or
otherwise disposed of since the Target Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business), or with respect to leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests therein, free and clear of all Encumbrances of any kind or
character, except (a) liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable; (b)
such imperfections of title, liens and easements and similar Encumbrances as
do not and will not materially detract from or interfere with the use of the
properties subject thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise materially impair
business operations involving such properties; (c) liens securing indebtedness
for borrowed money that are reflected on the Target Balance Sheet; (d)
statutory or common Law liens to secure obligations to landlords, lessors or
renters under leases or rental agreements incurred in the ordinary course of

materialmen, to secure claims for labor, materials or supplies, and other like
liens incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice. The plants, property and equipment of Target that are used in the
Target Business are in all material respects in good operating condition and
repair, subject to normal wear and tear. All properties used in the Target
Business are reflected in the Target Balance Sheet to the extent required by
Norwegian GAAP. Target owns no real property.

(i) " _Environmental Laws_ " shall mean any Laws that pertain to the
protection of the environment, protection of public health and safety, or
protection of worker health and safety, or that pertain to the handling, use,
manufacturing, processing, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge,

Environmental Laws applicable to the properties or facilities used, leased or
occupied by Target at any time (collectively, " _Target Facilities_ ;" such
properties or facilities currently used, leased or occupied by Target are
defined herein as " _Target Current Facilities_ "), and no discharge,
emission, release, leak or spill of Hazardous Materials has occurred at any
Target Facilities that may or will give rise to liability of Target under
Environmental Laws. To Sellers Knowledge, there are no Hazardous Materials

or soils of or beneath any Target Current Facilities. To Sellers Knowledge,
there neither are nor have been any aboveground or underground storage tanks

other Person has claimed that Target is liable for alleged injury or illness
resulting from an alleged exposure to a Hazardous Material. No civil,
criminal or administrative action, proceeding or investigation is pending or
threatened against Target with respect to Hazardous Materials or Environmental
Laws. To Sellers Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that could
reasonably form the basis for assertion of a claim against Target or that

Materials or regarding actual or potential noncompliance with Environmental
Laws.

 



 

3.19 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Returns_. Target has duly and timely filed all Tax Returns required
to be filed with any Tax Authority, which Tax Returns in all respects are
true, correct and complete. Target is currently not the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No claim has been made
by a Tax Authority in a jurisdiction where Target has not filed Tax Returns
that Target is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Target is
not subject to income Tax in any country other than its country of formation
by virtue of having a permanent establishment or other place of business in
that country. Target has not at any time made, changed or rescinded any
express or deemed election relating to Taxes that is not reflected in any Tax
Return. Target has provided to Acquiror in the Electronic Data Room copies of

those incurred following the Target Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice. All Taxes that Target was required

There are no liens for Taxes upon any of the assets of Target other than liens
for Taxes not yet due and payable.

 



 

(c) _Deficiencies; Waivers; Audits; Rulings_. No Tax deficiency is outstanding
or assessed or, to Sellers Knowledge, proposed against Target that is not
reflected as a liability on the Target Balance Sheet. Target has not executed
any agreements or waivers extending any statute of limitations on or extending
the period for the assessment or collection of any Tax, which waiver or
extension is currently in effect. No Tax audits or administrative or judicial
Tax proceedings are pending or being conducted with respect to Target, and
there is to Sellers Knowledge no basis for the commencement of any Tax
dispute against Target. Target has not granted any power of attorney with
respect to any Tax matter which is currently in force, other than to third
parties for purposes of payroll, custom duties, value-added tax and other
third parties to whom such powers of attorney are customarily granted. No
material issues relating to Taxes were raised by a Tax Authority in any
completed audit or examination of Target that would reasonably be expected to
recur in a taxable period not yet audited. Target has not received from any
Tax Authority (including jurisdictions where Target has not filed Tax Returns)
any (i) notice indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, (ii)
request for information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency
or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed
by any Tax Authority against Target. Target has delivered to Acquiror correct
and complete copies of all Taxing Authority examination reports and statements
of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by Target. Target has not been
the subject of a ruling received from a Taxing Authority that has continuing

Tax pending between Target and any Tax Authority.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Liability for any Other Person s Taxes_. Target has no joint and several
Tax Liability for any Person by reason of having filed an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax Return with such other Person.
Target is not a party to any Tax-sharing agreement, Tax allocation agreement,
Tax indemnity agreement or similar agreement or arrangement with any other
Person. Target has not assumed any obligation to pay any Tax obligations of,
or with respect to any transaction relating to, any other Person (including
Seller and/or any affiliate of Seller) or agreed to indemnify any other Person
(including Seller and/or any affiliate of Seller) with respect to any Tax.

 



 

(e) _Tax Incentives_. No Tax exemption, Tax benefits or other positive Tax
treatments which Target enjoys can be cancelled as a consequence of
circumstances deriving from Targets activities prior to Closing.

 



 

(f) _Dispositions_. All dispositions accounted for in the Audited Financial
Statements have been correctly treated for Tax purposes. There is no basis for
reclassification of dispositions and Target will continue to record all
dispositions in a manner which will not lead to any basis for
reclassifications from a Tax and/or accounting purpose until the Closing.

 



 

3.20 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) No plan, program, policy, contract, agreement or other arrangement
provides for severance, separation, or termination pay to employees, other
than as required by Law.

 



 

(b) Section 3.20(b) of the Target Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of each Target Employee Plan.

 



 

(c) Target has delivered to Acquiror: (i) a complete copy of each Target
Employee Plan as amended (or a summary of any oral Target Employee Plan); (ii)
a copy of any and all rulings or notices issued by a governmental authority to
Target specifically with respect to each such Target Employee Plan; (iii) all
contracts and agreements (and any amendments thereto) relating to each such
Target Employee Plan, including all trust agreements, investment management
agreements, annuity contracts, insurance contracts, bonds, indemnification
agreements and service provider agreements; (iv) the most recent annual
actuarial valuation, if any, prepared for each such Target Employee Plan; and
(v) all communications relating to the creation, amendment or termination of
each such Target Employee Plan, or an increase or decrease in benefits,
acceleration of payments or vesting or other events that could result in
liability to Target.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Each of the Target Employee Plans has been established, maintained and
administered in compliance with its terms and conditions and with the Law
applicable to such Target Employee Plan. No Target Employee Plan has unfunded
liabilities as of the Closing Date except for those that are fully offset by
insurance or have been fully accrued on the Net Working Capital Certificate.
All Target Employee Plans required to have been approved by a Governmental
Entity (or permitted to have been approved to obtain any beneficial tax or
other status) have been so approved, no such approval has been revoked (nor,
as of the Agreement, has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred
since the date of the most recent approval relating to any such Target
Employee Plan that is reasonably likely to adversely affect any such approval
relating thereto.

 



 

(e) The pension liabilities shown in the Audited Financial Statements
(including the notes thereto) duly reflect all pension obligations and
commitment of the Target and its Subsidiaries as for the relevant periods and
as per the relevant dates. Since the Target Balance Sheet Date, no pension
liabilities have been incurred outside of the ordinary course of business.
Section 3.21(e) of the Target Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
correct description of all pension obligations, including the most recent
actuarial report (if applicable), and commitments of Target in relation to
Employees and former employees of Target. Target has complied with all terms
and conditions of such pension obligations and commitments.

for benefits), arbitrations, administrative or other proceedings pending or
threatened with respect to any Target Employee Plan or any related trust or
other funding medium or with respect to Target, as the sponsor or fiduciary
thereof, nor, to the Sellers Knowledge, is there any reasonable basis
therefor. No Target Employee Plan or any related trust or other funding medium
or any fiduciary is the subject of an audit, investigation or examination by a
Governmental Entity.

 



 

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (i) entitle any current or former employee or other service provider of
Target to severance benefits or any other additional payment (including golden
parachute, bonus or benefits under any Target Employee Plan), except as
expressly provided in this Agreement (including the Schedule of Employees and
Consultants); or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or
service provider except as provided in the Schedule of Employees and
Consultants.

notice by the terminating party to the other party (and may, for the avoidance
of doubt, under no circumstances be terminated after the Closing):

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Acquiror and Seller;

 



 

(b) by either Acquiror or Seller if the Closing shall not have been
consummated on or before September 1, 2013; provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available
with respect to a party if the failure to consummate the Closing on or prior
to such date is the result of any breach of this Agreement by the party
seeking to terminate the Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Section
8.1(b); or

 



 

(c) by either Acquiror or Seller if a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Entity shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or

permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Closing.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, there shall be no Liability on the part of Acquiror,
Seller or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or
shareholders; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any party to this Agreement
from any liability resulting from or arising out of any intentional, material
breach of any agreement or covenant hereunder; _provided further, however_ ,
that the provisions of Sections 6.2, 6.3, 8.2 and 10 shall remain in full
force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

9. _Holdback and Indemnification_.

 



 

9.1 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _Survival of Warranties_. All representations and warranties made by
Target herein or in the certificates delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(c)
shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect until: (a) 30
days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations with
respect to the matters set forth in Section 3.1 (Authority), Section 3.5
(Capital Structure), and Section 3.19 (Taxes) (the " _Fundamental
Representations_ "), (b) the third anniversary of the Closing Date with
respect to the matters set forth in Section 3.10 (Intellectual Property) (the
" _Extended Representations_ ") and (b) the Termination Date with respect to
all other matters (the " _Other Representations_ ").

 



 

(b) _Indemnity_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9, from
and after the Closing, Seller will indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror,
Parent, any other direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent (each an " _Acquiror
Indemnified Person_ ") from and against any Damages arising out of or in
connection with:

 



 

(i) any breach of any Other Representation;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any breach of any Extended Representations;

 



 

(iii) any breach of any Fundamental Representations;

 



 

(iv) any breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement;

 



 

(v) any Liability that should have been included in the calculation of Net
Working Capital; or

 



 

(vi) any claims from Sellers shareholders, creditors or option holders
against Target or the Parent Group in respect of the liquidation and
dissolution of Seller and the distribution of proceeds by Seller to Sellers
shareholders and option holders.

 



 

(c) _Right to Bring Claim_. Only Acquiror (or a Person designated in writing
by Acquiror) may bring a claim to recover for Damages that are economic losses
of Target or Acquiror.

 



 

(d) _Materiality Disregarded for Damages Calculation_. For purposes of
determining the amount of any Damages with respect thereto (but not for
purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred), all representations
and warranties of Target that are qualified as to materiality or by reference
to a Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to be not so qualified.

 



 

(e) _Essential Term_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the rights
of any Acquiror Indemnified Person to indemnification pursuant to this Section
9.1 are an essential part of the economic terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. An Acquiror Indemnified Persons rights to
indemnification under this Agreement shall in no way be limited or eliminated
or otherwise affected by the fact that such Acquiror Indemnified Person, or
any of its directors, officers, employees or advisors, was at any time prior
to or as of the Closing or the execution of this Agreement aware (or should
have become aware) of any fact (including that any representation or warranty
was untrue or incorrect or that any covenant or agreement had been breached).

 



 

(f) _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise required
by applicable Law, the parties shall treat any indemnification payment made
hereunder by Seller as an adjustment to the purchase price for the Shares for
income Tax purposes.

 



 

9.2 _Holdback Period; Release From Holdback_. The remaining Holdback Amount
(after satisfaction of any indemnification claims) shall be paid to Sellers
Bank Account within 5 Business Days following the Termination Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that a portion of such remaining Holdback Amount that, in the
reasonable judgment of Acquiror, is sufficient to satisfy any potential
unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate (as defined in
Section 9.3 below) delivered to the Seller prior to the Termination Date shall
be retained by Acquiror until such claims have been resolved. For purposes of
determining if Damages could reasonably be expected to exist in the future
with respect to an identified matter, Acquiror shall be entitled to treat all
allegations in a third-party claim (other than claims that are clearly
frivolous) as valid until such time as they are finally adjudicated to be
invalid.

 



       
 

 



 

9.3 _Claims Process_. On or before the Termination Date, Acquiror shall be
entitled to deliver a certificate signed by an officer of Acquiror (an "
_Officer s Certificate_") stating (i) Acquirors good faith belief that
Damages exist (or could reasonably be expected to exist with respect to an
identified matter) with respect to the indemnification obligations of Seller
set forth in Section 9.1, and specifying in reasonable detail the individual
items of such Damages included in the amount so stated, the date each such
item was paid, or properly accrued or arose, and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or claim to which such item is
related or (ii) that an Excess Adjustment Amount has been finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.5(b), then in each such case Acquiror shall, subject to
the provisions of this Section 9, be entitled to retain out of the Holdback
Amount cash having a value equal to such Damages or Excess Adjustment Amount,
as applicable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 9, including the
limitations on liability set out in Section 9.7, if Damages exceed the
available Holdback Amount, Acquiror is hereby authorized at any time
thereafter and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to
(a) reduce the Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration to satisfy any
indemnification obligation of Seller, (b) obtain repayment from Seller to the
extent any Holdback Amount, Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration or
Initial Cash Consideration has already been paid to Seller and (c) obtain
repayment from Seller in an amount equal to $19,999,981.21 (the original
amount of the Note). If Seller shall so object in writing to any claim or
claims by Acquiror made in any Officers Certificate, Acquiror shall have 30
days to respond in a written statement to the objection of Seller. If after
such 30 day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, Seller and
Acquiror shall attempt in good faith for an additional period of up to 45 days
to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of
such claims.

 



 

9.4 _Resolution of Conflicts and Arbitration_.

 



 

(a) If no agreement has been reached after good faith negotiation between the
parties pursuant to Section 9.3, either Acquiror or Seller may, by written
notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the
Damages is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator. Acquiror and Seller shall
agree on the arbitrator, _provided_ that if Acquiror and Seller cannot agree
on such arbitrator, either Acquiror or Seller can request that Judicial
Arbitration and Mediation Services (" _JAMS_ ") select the arbitrator. The
arbitrator shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed
to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an
opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator, to discover
relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the
dispute. The arbitrator shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery
and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees
and costs, to the same extent as a court of competent law or equity (but
subject to the limitations of this Section 9), should the arbitrator determine
that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery
was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of
the arbitrator shall be written, shall be in accordance with applicable Law
and with this Agreement, and shall be supported by written findings of fact
and conclusions of law which shall set forth the basis for the decision of the
arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator as to the validity and amount of
any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon
the parties to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Delaware, US
and shall be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures (located at www.jamsadr.com), except to the extent those rules and
procedures conflict with provisions of this Agreement, in which case the
provisions set forth in this Agreement regarding arbitration shall govern.
Seller and Acquiror shall each be responsible for (i) their own fees and
expenses incurred in connection with any arbitration under this Section 9 and
(ii) 50% of the arbitrators fees, in each of cases (i) and (ii), except to
the extent such fees and expenses constitute Damages hereunder (in which case
they shall be paid and reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 9).

 



 

(c) Except with respect to matters subject to dispute resolution pursuant
Section 2.4 or Section 2.5, any other dispute regarding this Agreement shall
be resolved in the manner set forth in this Section 9.4.

 



 

9.5 _Notice and opportunity to defend_. In the event that Acquiror would make
a claim against Seller, Acquiror shall allow and grant permission to Seller to
gain reasonable access during normal business hours to all books and records
held by Target reasonably relevant to the claim and the defense against the
claim. Acquiror shall ensure that Target shall allow Seller such reasonable
access.

 



 

9.6 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Acquiror becomes aware of a third-party
claim that Acquiror believes may result in an indemnification claim pursuant
to Section 9, Acquiror shall notify the Seller of such claim (but the failure
to deliver such notice shall not limit Acquirors rights under this
Agreement). Acquiror shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any
such claim. Acquiror shall consult with the Seller prior to entering into a
settlement of any claim that would result in Damages being paid from the
remaining Holdback Amount (but Acquiror shall nevertheless be free to settle
any such claim regardless of whether the Seller consents to such settlement).
In the event that the Seller has consented to any settlement of a third-party
claim with regard to a specific dollar amount of Damages, the Seller shall
have no power to dispute (under Section 9.3, Section 9.4 or otherwise)
Acquirors right to indemnity hereunder with respect to such settlement.

 



 

9.7 _Limitations on Recovery_.

 



 

(a) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy Pursuant to this Agreement_. Following the
Closing, the indemnification rights provided in this Section 9 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for Acquiror pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to Damages of any kind or nature arising out of or in
connection with any matter as listed in Section 9.1(b), other than with
respect to Fraud by Target (prior to or as of the Closing) or by Seller.

 



 

(b) _Cap on Liability_. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.7(a), the
recourse of Acquiror pursuant to this Agreement with respect to: (i) Section
9.1(b)(i) (Other Warranties) shall be limited to the Holdback Amount plus an
offset against any earned but unpaid amount of any Earn-Out Period Additional
Consideration; (ii) Section 9.1(b)(ii) ((Extended Warranties) shall be limited
to the Holdback Amount, an offset against any earned but unpaid amount of any
Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration and the right to be repaid by Seller
to the extent any Holdback Amount or Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration
has already been paid to Seller; and (iii) Section 9.1(b)(iii) (Fundamental
Warranties) through Section 9.1(b)(vi) shall be limited to (a) the Holdback
Amount, (b) an offset against any earned but unpaid amount of any Earn-Out
Period Additional Consideration, (c) the right to be repaid by Seller to the
extent any Holdback Amount, Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration or other
Initial Cash Consideration has already been paid to Seller and (d) the right
to be repaid $19,999,981.21 (the amount of the Note). With respect to any
situation in which multiple sections are applicable, the higher limit shall be
applicable. In the absence of Fraud, in no event shall the aggregate liability
of Seller for indemnification or otherwise under this Agreement exceed an
amount equal to the Holdback Amount plus the Initial Cash Consideration plus
any accrued Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration plus $19,999,981.21 (the
amount of the Note).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Single Loss Threshold_. Seller shall not be liable for any single claim
where the Damages relating to such claim are less than $10,000 (for purposes
of this calculation, all losses of a similar nature shall be treated as the
same loss). All Damages that are excluded pursuant to this Section 9.7(c)
shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the threshold referred to in
Section 9.7(d).

 



 

(d) _Threshold for Certain Claims_. No claim for Damages shall be made with
respect to Section 9.1(b)(i) through Section 9.1(b)(iii) unless all Damages of
all Acquiror Indemnified Persons under all such Sections, in the aggregate,
exceed $650,000, in which case the Acquiror Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to indemnification for all Damages from the first dollar (without
regard to the limitation set forth in this Section 9.7(c)).

 



 

(e) _No Limitation on Additional Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit (A) the
survival provisions of Section 8.2 if the Closing does not occur; or (B) the
liability in amount or otherwise of any Seller with respect to Fraud by Seller
or the Target.

 



 

(f) _No Subrogation_. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that an
Acquiror Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 9, the Seller shall not be entitled to exercise, or be subrogated to,
any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution
and other rights of recovery) that the Acquiror Indemnified Person or any of
its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates may have against any other Person with
respect to any Damages, circumstances or matter to which such indemnification
is directly or indirectly related.

 



 

(g) _Tax benefits and Tax detriments_. Any Damages shall be calculated net of
any Tax benefits actually realized (by reduction of Taxes otherwise payable or
by refund) by the Parent Group, in the aggregate, by reason of deductibility
of such Damages during or prior to the Taxable period in which the
indemnification payment is made; provided, however, that a realized Tax
benefit shall not decrease such Damages if such Tax benefit would have been
realized even in the absence of the relevant breach by Seller or other item
described in Section 9.1(b). Any Damage shall be calculated by increasing such
Damage by any Tax detriment actually realized (by increase in Taxes otherwise
payable or by reduction of refund) by the Parent Group, in the aggregate, by
reason of income with respect to such Damage or indemnification payment during
or prior to the Taxable period in which the indemnification payment is made;
provided, however, that a realized Tax detriment shall not increase such
Damages if such Tax detriment would have been realized even in the absence of
the relevant breach by Seller or other item described in Section 9.1(b).

 



      
 

 



 

(h) _Mitigation_. Where the matter giving rise to indemnity is capable of
remedy, Acquiror shall not be entitled to indemnification unless written
notice of the matter is given to Seller and the matter is not remedied to the
reasonable satisfaction of Acquiror within 30 days thereafter. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, such notice requirement and 30 day period shall not impact any
other deadlines or calculations under this Agreement or the accrual of
indemnifiable Damages (for example, Acquiror shall be entitled to submit a
claim pursuant to Section 9.3 even if such 30 day period has not yet been
completed).

 



 

(i) _Other limitations_. Seller shall not be liable for indemnification
hereunder with respect to Damage to the extent (a) covered by a provision made
in the Net Working Capital Certificate or otherwise reflected in the final
calculation of the Net Working Capital, (b) covered by insurance proceeds or
other third party payments actually received by the relevant Acquiror
Indemnified Person with respect to such Damages (minus any resulting insurance
premiums or other costs relating to such recovery (such as litigation costs
incurred to obtain such insurance proceeds or third party payments)) or (c)
based on a contingent loss, which shall not be deemed Damage unless and until
such contingent loss becomes an actual loss. Until the contingency is
resolved, Acquiror shall be entitled to retain the Holdback Amount and any
Earn-Out Period Additional Consideration under this Section 9 with respect to
any such contingent loss even if it has not yet become an actual loss.
Furthermore, with respect to a breach of Section 3.10(f)(iv) or 3.26, Seller
shall not be liable for the cost of any debugging or redesign undertaken in
the ordinary course of business.

10.2 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. The parties will take
reasonable action in order to effectuate the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement within reasonable time.

 



 

10.3 _LIMITATION OF LIABILITY_. IN NO EVENT SHALL ACQUIROR BE LIABLE FOR
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 



 

10.5 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest; Assignment_. This Agreement and
the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the exhibits and schedules
hereto, including the Target Disclosure Schedule together constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, including the
Letter of Intent, dated April 28, 2013, but excluding the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive
any termination of this Agreement or the Closing, in accordance with its
terms. No party to this Agreement, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
representatives or agents, is making any representation or warranty
whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, other than those set forth in
this Agreement including the exhibits and schedules hereto (including the
Target Disclosure Schedule). The terms and provisions of this Agreement are
intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to
confer third-party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not confer any
such rights, upon any other Person other than to Acquiror Indemnified Persons
pursuant to Section 9. This Agreement shall not be assigned by Seller without
the written consent of Acquiror. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
Acquiror without the written consent of Seller, unless Acquiror and Parent
guarantees the performance by such assignee of Acquirors obligations
hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

10.6 _Dissolution and liquidation of Seller_. Acquiror acknowledges that
Acquiror has been notified that a dissolution and liquidation ( _Norwegian:
"oppl øsning og avvikling")_ of Seller is contemplated and will be initiated
as soon as practical following signing of this Agreement. Acquirors rights
under this Agreement shall not be limited and Acquirors obligations under
this Agreement shall not be expanded by such dissolution and liquidation. The
Seller covenants that (a) Seller shall not complete any liquidation before
June 30, 2019, provided, however, that Seller may make intermediate
distributions of liquidation proceeds prior to such period, (b) Seller shall
not distribute any funds or assets to its shareholders other than by way of
liquidation proceeds pursuant to the Private Limited Liabilities Act Chapter
16, (c) upon any such distribution, the Seller undertakes to inform its
shareholders clearly that the proceeds may be subject to a reclaim in case a
claim is filed by the Acquiror pursuant to the Agreement as there are
unsettled possible claims under such Agreement, and (d) Seller shall notify
Acquiror of the amounts distributed to each of Sellers shareholders and their
address. Subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 10.6, Acquiror
agrees not to object in any way, either directly or indirectly, to the
dissolution and liquidation of Seller. Furthermore, it is agreed that any
claims made towards Sellers shareholders pursuant to Section 16-12 of the
Norwegian private limited liability companies act shall be on a pro rata basis
so that each shareholder shall be liable only for a percentage of the claim
equal to its ownership interest in Seller as per the date of this Agreement.

 



 

10.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

10.8 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies expressly conferred in this Agreement upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred by
this Agreement, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy under this
Agreement will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy expressly
conferred by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of
Delaware applicable to parties residing in Delaware, without regard applicable
principles of conflicts of law.

 



 

10.10 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of
this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or
an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
References herein to a Section shall be deemed to also refer to all
subsections under such Section (e.g. a reference to Section 3.10(b) would be
deemed to refer to Section 3.10(b)(i) and Section 3.10(b)(ii) and any
subsections thereunder as well). The table of contents and headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such term. All references in this Agreement that provide
that documents have been "delivered to Acquiror" or "provided to Acquiror"
shall be deemed satisfied solely to the extent that (a) the applicable
document(s) was provided in the Electronic Data Room at least one day prior to
the date hereof or (b) delivered via e-mail to Acquirors legal counsel or an
employee of Acquiror engaged in the negotiation or due diligence investigation
regarding this transaction at least two days prior to the date hereof. All
references herein to "$" or "dollar" shall mean US dollars. References herein
to an entity taking an action shall include any action taken by such entitys
employees and agents.

 



 

10.11 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended and any provision
hereof may be waived at any time, in each case, only by execution of an
instrument in writing signed by both Acquiror and Seller. The failure of a
party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist upon strict
adherence to any term or condition hereof on any one occasion shall not be
construed as a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist
upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at a later
date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other term of condition
hereof (whether or not similar) unless explicitly waived.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Acquiror, Seller and Parent have caused this Agreement to
be executed and delivered by each of them or their respective officers
thereunto duly authorized, all as of the date first written above.
