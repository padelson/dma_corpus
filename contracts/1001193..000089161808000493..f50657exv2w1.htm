 (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company in treasury or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to 

   ##### 

  

    

the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; 

  

 (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be cancelled and no longer deemed outstanding, and the holders thereof shall not have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with Section 1.8; 

  

 (iv) each share of Company Series B Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any election to convert shares of Company Series B Stock into Company Common Stock effective at or prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to receive $7.50 in cash, without interest (the "Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Series B Stock shall automatically be cancelled and no longer deemed outstanding, and the holders thereof shall not have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with Section 1.8;

The aggregate amount of cash consideration that each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock is entitled to receive for shares of Company Common
Stock held by such holder pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) shall be rounded
down to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating the cash amounts
payable for all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if the Company declares a stock dividend during such period, or a record date with respect to any such event occurs during such period, then the Per Share Merger Consideration or Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration, as applicable, shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration provided for in Section 1.5(a)(iii), but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (but only after the value therefor has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof upon the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 1.8 (or as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter), the total amount of cash consideration to which such holder would be entitled in respect thereof under Section 1.5(a)(iii) as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares (and all such cash shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have become deliverable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii)). The Company shall comply in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent (i) reasonably prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 1.6 [RESERVED] 

   

 1.7 _Payment Fund_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable national bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") to act as paying agent under this Agreement for the purpose of distributing the aggregate cash consideration distributable pursuant to Sections 1.5(a)(iii) and 1.5(a)(iv) (the "Cash Consideration"). Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within two Business Days thereafter), Parent shall deposit (and cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit) with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series B Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Cash Consideration (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than paying the Cash Consideration to former Company stockholders, and shall be invested 

    ##### 

  

 

in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit or similar instruments of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10
billion. 

   

 1.8 _Payment Procedures_. 

   

 (a) Parent shall instruct, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause, the Paying Agent to mail promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within two Business Days thereafter) to each holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock (collectively, the "Certificates"): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and having such provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree before the Effective Time (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Paying Agent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for such holderÂ’s applicable portion of the Cash Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent (or receipt of an "agentÂ’s message" by the Paying Agent (or any other evidence of transfer that the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of the transfer of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock held in book-entry form) together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions to the transmittal letter, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the Certificate the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration. 

  

 (b) No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Cash Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration shall be payable to such transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

  

 1.9 _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock who have not complied with the provisions of this Section 1 as of that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock formerly represented thereby, and Parent shall, upon the request of any such former stockholder, promptly pay to such Persons the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration to which he, she or it is entitled. Any such portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock on the date that is three years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any 

    ##### 

  

 

Governmental Body pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements) shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously
entitled to that portion of the Payment Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement. 

   

 1.10 _Closing of the Company Â’s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series B Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist (in exchange for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration or the Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration, as applicable, or the right to receive consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(c)), and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series B Stock that were outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series B Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock shall be made on such transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificate shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 1. 

   

 1.11 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock formerly represented thereby only after the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed makes an affidavit to such effect. 

   

 1.12 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Cash Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

   

 1.13 [RESERVED] 

   

 1.14 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation determine that any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the members, managers, officers and 

    ##### 

  

 

directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized
(in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take

Such cash consideration shall be rounded down to the nearest cent, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such cash consideration such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Vested In-the-Money Options in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. 

  

 (b) Upon ParentÂ’s request, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may be reasonably necessary to: (i) cause any outstanding offering period under the Company ESPP to be terminated as of the last Business Day prior to the date on 

   ##### 

  

    

which the Merger becomes effective (the last Business Day prior to the date on
which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the "Designated
Date"); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect
the shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering
period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all
purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise as of the
Designated Date of each outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP;
and (iv) provide that no further offering period or purchase period shall
commence under the Company ESPP after the Designated Date; _provided, however_
, that the actions described in clauses "(i)" through "(iv)" of this sentence
shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. On the Designated
Date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the
Company ESPP within each participantÂ’s payroll withholding account to
the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of the Company ESPP. Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company
shall terminate the Company ESPP. 

  

 5.4 Employee Benefits. 

   

 (a) During the Pre-Closing period, the Company shall allow Parent reasonable access, during normal business hours and on reasonable prior notice, to the CompanyÂ’s employees, and shall, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, provide any information that Parent may reasonably request, for the purpose of evaluating and, in ParentÂ’s sole discretion, making offers of employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation to such employees; provided that, without the consent of the Company, such employment with the Parent or Surviving Corporation shall commence no earlier than the Closing Date. Any such employees who are offered employment by Parent and who accept such employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation are referred to herein as "Continuing Employees." On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a release of claims (and shall consult with Parent regarding the form of such release) from all of its employees and shall take all reasonably necessary actions (including the timely provision of any required notices), at and in advance of the Closing Date, such that the termination of each such Company employee is in compliance with all Applicable Laws, Company policies and the terms of any Company Benefit Plans, if applicable. Parent agrees to cause all Continuing Employees to be eligible to participate in ParentÂ’s or the Surviving CorporationÂ’s employee benefit plans and programs, if any, and in each case, in accordance with their terms, including any equity incentive plan, pension plan, defined benefit plan, defined contribution plan, Section 401(k) plan, bonus plan, profit sharing plan, severance plan, medical plan, dental plan, life insurance plan, time-off programs and disability plan, in each case, consistent with the eligibility criteria applied by Parent to other employees of Parent. The Continuing Employees shall receive full credit for prior years of service with Company (subject to the limitations and restrictions applicable to Parent employees) and parity with Parent employees with respect to eligibility to participate in all Parent employee benefit plans, programs and policies. Compensation provided to Continuing Employees shall be determined by Parent in its sole discretion. Parent agrees and acknowledges that the buying group (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-2(c)) (the "Buying Group") will use commercially reasonable efforts to offer a group health plan to employees after the Effective Time and, accordingly, that Parent and the Buying Group shall be solely responsible for providing continuation coverage under COBRA to those individuals who are Company MandA qualified beneficiaries (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4(b)) with 

   ##### 

  

    

respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the
"MandA Qualified Beneficiaries"). The Company agrees and acknowledges that it
will provide Parent with such information necessary for Parent or the Buying
Group to offer continuation coverage to such MandA Qualified Beneficiaries
prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) If requested by Parent at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions pursuant to resolutions of the CompanyÂ’s board of directors necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the CompanyÂ’s board of directors of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, but subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall pay to any employee of the Company who was terminated between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time all severance and other payments which such employee would have been entitled to receive under the terms of any Contract or Company Employee Plan had such employee been terminated after the Effective Time. 

  

 5.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects, the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its current and former directors and officers as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") and any indemnification and exculpation provisions under the CompanyÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, in each case, subject to applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 (b) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, except to the extent that modification is required by applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 (c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, at no expense to the Indemnified Parties, either (i) maintain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance maintained by the Company (the "Current DandO Insurance") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Contemplated Transactions), so long as the annual premium therefor would not be 

   ##### 

  

    

in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time
(such 200%, the "Maximum Premium"), or (ii) purchase a six year extended
reporting period endorsement with respect to the Current DandO Insurance (a
"Reporting Tail Endorsement") and maintain such endorsement in full force and
effect for its full term. If the CompanyÂ’s existing insurance expires, is
terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the CompanyÂ’s
existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may, prior to the
Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided that the
Company does not pay more than six times the Maximum Premium for such
Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which case, provided that Parent causes the
Surviving Corporation to maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full
force and effect for its full term, Parent shall be relieved from its
obligations under the preceding two sentences of this Section 5.5(c). 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.5 are intended to be in addition to, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, enforce and honor, to the fullest extent permitted by law for a period of six years from the Effective Time, the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their Representatives. 

  

 5.6 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters. 

   

 (a) Each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file, or shall cause their "ultimate parent entities" (as that term is defined in the HSR Act and its implementing regulations) to prepare and file, the notifications required under the HSR Act and under any other Legal Requirement that is designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws") in connection with the Merger. The Company and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to: (i) any inquiries or requests (including any "second request" for information) received from the Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice ("FTC/DOJ") for additional information or documentation; and (ii) any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related matters. 

  

 (b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each shall promptly supply the other parties with any information that may be required in order to effectuate any filings or applications pursuant to Section 5.6(a). Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall, (i) consult with the other party prior to taking a position with respect to or making any such 

   ##### 

  

    

filing, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers, arguments,
opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of the foregoing
to any Governmental Body by or on behalf of any party to this Agreement in
connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection with this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, (iii) coordinate with the other
in preparing and exchanging such information, and (iv) promptly provide the
other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or
submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with
any Governmental Body in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions; _provided that_ with respect to any such filing, presentation
or submission, each of Parent and the Company need not supply the other (or
its counsel) with copies (or, in case of oral presentations, a summary) to
the extent that any Legal Requirement applicable to such party requires such
party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
information or to the extent required by any existing confidentiality or non-
disclosure agreement. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary,
designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under
this Section as "outside counsel only." Such material and the information
contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers,
or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the
party providing such materials. In addition, to the extent reasonably
practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and meetings with a
Governmental Body regarding the transactions described herein shall
include representatives of both parties. 

  

 (c) Each party will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Body in connection with any filings made pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Body for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any applicable Legal Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 5.6(a), each party will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Body such amendment or supplement. 

  

 (d) Parent and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party in connection with the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; and (ii) shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, including, but not limited to, (A) entering into negotiations with any applicable Governmental Body; (B) providing information required by law or governmental regulation; and (C) substantially complying with any "second request" for information pursuant to Antitrust Law. 

  

 (e) If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violating any Antitrust Law, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall: (i) contest, resist or 

   ##### 

  

    

resolve any such proceeding or action; and (ii) use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
injunction resulting from such proceeding or action; _provided, however_ ,
that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be under an obligation to
make proposals, execute or carry out agreements, enter into consent decrees
or submit to orders providing for (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any material assets or categories of assets of Parent or any of
its affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) the imposition
of any material limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of
its affiliates to freely conduct their business or own such assets, or (C)
the holding separate of the shares of Company capital stock or any material
limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to
exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Company capital stock (any
of the foregoing, an "Antitrust Restraint").

 (a) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously entered into the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (b) Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement regarding the Merger or the Contemplated Transactions;  _provided, however,_ that contents of the initial press release announcing the execution of this Agreement has already been agreed to by the parties. The Company shall consult with Parent before issuing or making, and shall provide and shall not issue, any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior written consent of Parent; provided that the Company may, without obtaining the prior consent of Parent, issue such press release or make such public statements as the Company determines in good faith, following consultation with legal counsel, may be required by applicable Legal Requirements if Company has used all reasonable efforts to consult and discuss in good faith with Parent the form and content thereof prior to its release and has acted in good faith with respect to the incorporation of any reasonable changes which are suggested by Parent prior to releasing or making such press release or public statement. The Company shall cause its officers and directors to comply with this Section 5.7. The foregoing shall not restrict the Company from making any public statements permitted by Section 4.3(e). 

  

 5.8 Section 16 Matters. Provided that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable law) to cause any disposition of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Section 1 of this Agreement by each Company Insider (as defined below) to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. "Section 16 Information" means information regarding the Company Insiders, the number of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series B Stock held by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for cash in connection with the Merger, and the number and description of the Company Options held by each such Company Insider and expected to be converted into cash in connection with

The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective board of directors, members or managers, as applicable, shall use their commercially reasonably efforts (i) take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that no takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any takeover statue or similar statue or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 5.10 Certificates. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, prior to the Closing Date, deliver a certificate dated within three Business Days of the Closing from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and each state in which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation certifying that the Company or such Subsidiary is in good standing and that all applicable Taxes and fees of the Company or such Subsidiary through and including the Closing Date have been paid, and (ii) FIRPTA documentation, including (A) a notice to the Internal Revenue Service, in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2), in the form reasonably requested by Parent, dated as of the Closing Date and executed by the Company, together with written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice form to the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Company after the Effective Time, and (B) a FIRPTA Notification Letter, in the form reasonably requested by Parent, dated as of the Closing Date and executed by the Company.

The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver any notices required under any Company Significant Contract set forth on Schedule 5.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 5.13 Patent Fees. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to timely pay all maintenance fees, annuities, and the like due or 

    ##### 

  

 

payable as of the Closing Date on the patents and patent applications that are

payment includes payment of any maintenance fees for which the fee is payable
(e.g., the fee payment window opens) even if the surcharge date or final
deadline for payment of such fee would be in the future; _provided, however_
, that the Company shall not be obligated to pay any fee for which the
surcharge date or final deadline for payment is a date more than six months
following the Closing Date.

Parent and the Company shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreements, and the Closing Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect the resolution of any such disagreements. If Parent and the Company cannot resolve any such disagreements, then the parties shall engage a mutually agreed upon accounting firm of national standing (the "Special Auditor") to determine the amount of the Purchase Price (including the components of Purchase Price Upward Adjustment Amount and Purchase Price Downward Adjustment Amount), Common Stock Merger Consideration and/or Per Share Merger Consideration. The Company shall provide the Special Auditor with access to the relevant financial records and shall assist the Special Auditor in obtaining confirmations of information relating to the calculation of the Purchase Price (including the components of Purchase Price Upward Adjustment Amount and Purchase Price Downward Adjustment Amount), Common Stock Merger Consideration and/or Per Share Merger.

   ##### 

  

    

Company resolve any Closing Statement disagreements and (ii) the Special
