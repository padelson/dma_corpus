obligated to, from time to time, deposit any additional funds necessary to

letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Disbursing Agent) containing instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the
consideration to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this Article II.

shall promptly be provided in exchange therefor cash in the amount to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will accrue or be paid
with respect to any consideration to be delivered upon surrender of
Certificates.

 

(c) Transfer to Holder other than Existing Holder. If any cash payment is to
be made in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such payment in a name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting Person, or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) Transfers. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
registered on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company
Common Stock or Certificates that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent for any reason, they
shall be exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
or the Disbursing Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving Corporation or
the Disbursing Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, pay or cause to be paid the consideration deliverable in respect
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to
this Article II.

 

(f) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock or any holder of a
Company Stock Award pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any
other applicable provision of law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving

set forth on Schedule 2.09 hereto and any other arrangements governing or

otherwise or permit the receipt of shares of Company Common Stock or Rights
pursuant thereto, and (c) cause each Company Stock Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger to become fully vested and
exercisable with all restrictions removed. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to provide that, upon the
Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Award shall be cancelled
automatically, and at the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall provide such holder with a lump sum cash payment (less any applicable
withholding) equal to (A) with respect to stock option awards, the product of
(1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such holders Company Stock Award or Awards immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (2) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Award or Awards and (B) with respect to awards of restricted stock, the
product of (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such holders Company Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(2) the Per Share Amount.

(a) Each Dissenting Share shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company shall give Parent notice as promptly as reasonably practicable upon
receipt by the Company of any demand for payment pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL and of withdrawals of such notice (any stockholder duly making such
demand being hereinafter called a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. Any payments made in respect of
Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation; provided, that prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) his or her right to dissent under Section 262
of the DGCL, each of such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall be
converted solely into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

director, officer, employee or consultant, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to change of control, severance or termination compensation or
benefits, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any Benefit Arrangement (or any grant or award
thereunder) or (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under,
any Benefit Arrangement (or any grant or award thereunder). No amount or
benefit that could be received by any "disqualified

 



 



 

29

  individual" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G 1) with respect

Benefit Arrangement or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any
Benefit Arrangement.

 

(8) To the Knowledge of the Company, with respect to each Benefit Arrangement
subject to ERISA, there has not occurred any "prohibited transaction" (within

reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective employees, or any trustee, administrator or other
fiduciary of any trust created under any Benefit Arrangement, to the tax or
penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the
sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA or to any liability for breach of
fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable law.

 

(9) Each Benefit Arrangement that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA may be amended or terminated (including
with respect to benefits provided to retirees and other former employees)
without material liability (other than liability for benefits then payable
under such plan without regard to such amendment or termination) to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time after the Effective Time.

 

(10) To the Knowledge of the Company, each Benefit Arrangement that is subject
to 409A of the Code has been operated in good faith compliance with Section
409A of the Code and no person has a right to any gross up from the Company
with respect to any 409A arrangement.

 

(11) With respect to the options underling the Companys Stock Awards, (i) to

in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including the related

with the Exchange Act and all other applicable laws. The Company has not
Knowingly timed the grant of, and there is no and has been no policy or
practice of the Company of timing the grant of, any option with the purpose of
benefiting the recipient thereof by specifically taking advantage of the
release or other public announcement of material non-public information
regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or their results of operations or
prospects.

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser
and  the Company will each use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be  taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things  necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable laws,
so as to  permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable and
otherwise to  enable consummation of the Transactions, including the taking
of all actions  set forth in Schedule 5.01(a) and providing each other Party
cooperation  reasonably necessary in connection therewith, and each will
cooperate fully  with, and furnish information to, the other Party to that
end; provided, that  if any objections are asserted with respect to the
Transactions under Exon-Florio  or any Applicable Antitrust Law, or if any
suit is threatened to be instituted,  by any Governmental Authority or any
private party challenging any of the Transactions  or otherwise brought under
Exon-Florio or any Applicable Antitrust Law that  would prohibit or
materially impair or materially delay the consummation of  the Transactions,
the Parties each agree to take actions that may be reasonably  necessary to
resolve any objections as may be asserted under Exon-Florio (including  by

(including  disposing of or holding separate any businesses or assets of the
Company, Parent  or any of their respective Affiliates under the HSR Act);
provided, that notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the

material portion of the business or assets of the Company,  Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates, as a result of the Merger or any  of the other
Transactions or (ii) to compel the Company, Parent or any of their 
respective Affiliates to dispose of or hold separate any portion of the

Affiliates that  would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the financial  condition, results of operations, assets, or
business of (x) the Company and  its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y)
Parent and its Subsidiaries taken  as a whole (measured against the financial
condition, results of operations,  assets and business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole),  as a result of the Merger or any of the
other Transactions. Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no action taken by Parent, Purchaser  or any of their respective
Affiliates pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall entitle  Parent or Purchaser
to any diminution of the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) The Company shall deliver to Parent at the Closing a duly executed and
acknowledged certificate, in a form and substance acceptable to Parent and in

securing obligations  thereunder to be released.

 

(d)  Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take
reasonable  steps to ensure that it engages in good faith consultation with
Parent prior  to entering into any Contract that restricts in any material
respect the conduct  of business by it or any of its Subsidiaries or its or
their ability (or, to  the Knowledge of the Company, which following the
consummation of the Merger,  could materially restrict the ability of Parent
or any of its Affiliates, including  the Company and its Subsidiaries) to
compete or engage in any material line  of business, or to develop, market or
distribute any material products or material  services, in each case, in any
geographic territory.

Board shall have made a Company Board  Change of Recommendation as expressly
permitted by Section 5.06(e), include  in the Proxy Statement the
recommendation of the Company Board that the stockholders  of the Company
adopt this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company  properly
exercises its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in 
accordance with Section 7.01(c), the Companys obligations pursuant to  the
first sentence of this Section 5.02 shall terminate.

cleared by the SEC promptly. The Company  shall (i) provide Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review  and comment upon the Proxy
Statement prior to the filing with the SEC and (ii)  shall reasonably
consider all comments reasonably proposed by Parent in writing.  In addition,
the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a written copy  of any
comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff 
with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of such comments 
and with copies of any written responses to such comments, other
correspondence  and telephonic notification of any verbal responses to such
comments by the  Company or its counsel. Each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser agrees to  use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with
the other parties hereto,  to respond promptly to all such comments of and
requests by the SEC and to cause  the Proxy Statement and all required
amendments and supplements thereto to be  mailed to the holders of Shares

issue

 



 



 

37

  any such press release, public statement or public filing without the prior
written consent of the other Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned; provided, that a Party may, without the prior consent
of the other Party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in
the circumstances), issue any such press release or a public statement or file
any required documents with the SEC or any listing authority as may be
required by applicable law or securities exchange or listing authority rules.

relating to the exchange of information, it will (and will cause its
Subsidiaries to) afford Parent, and Parents Representatives and accountants,
such access during normal business hours throughout the period before the
Effective Time to its books, records (including Tax Returns and work papers of
independent auditors), Contracts, personnel and properties and to such other
information as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that such
access shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company. All
requests for such access shall be made exclusively to Representatives of the
Company as the Company shall designate, who shall be solely responsible for
coordinating all such requests and all access permitted hereunder. Neither
Parent nor any of Parents Representatives shall contact any of the
employees, customers or suppliers of the Company in connection with the
Transactions, whether in Person or by telephone, mail or other means of
communication, without the specific prior written authorization of such
Representatives of the Company as the Company may designate. The Company will
not be required to afford access or disclose information that would jeopardize
attorney-client privilege, contravene any binding agreement with any third
party or violate any law or regulation. The Parties will make reasonable
appropriate substitute arrangements in circumstances where the previous
sentence applies.

 

(b)  Each Party will treat any information provided in connection with this
Agreement  or the Transactions as "Evaluation Material" in accordance with
the  Confidentiality Agreement.

 

5.06  _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries or its or its Subsidiaries Representatives
to, (i) initiate, solicit or facilitate (including by way of furnishing or
disclosing nonpublic information or permitting access to personnel or
facilities) inquiries or proposals with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) enter into or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, that at any time prior to obtaining Company
Stockholder Approval the Company may furnish information to, or enter into
discussions or negotiations with, any Person that has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
Section 5.06, in each case in respect of such Acquisition Proposal, if,
subject to further compliance with this Section 5.06: (1) (A) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) a majority of the Company
Board, after consulting with and having considered the advice of outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, determines in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal, after furnishing such information and entering into such

 



 



 

38

  discussions or negotiations, would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, and (2) prior to taking such action, the Company receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms with respect
to confidentiality substantially similar in the aggregate to the
Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement and
any related agreement shall not contain any exclusivity provision in favor of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or having the effect of
prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement,
provided, further, that all information provided to a third party under this
Section 5.06 is provided on a prior or substantially concurrent basis to
Parent and Purchaser if such information has not previously been provided to
Parent or Purchaser). Unless in connection with the Company terminating
this Agreement in order to concurrently enter into a binding Acquisition
Agreement for a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 7.01(c), neither
the Company nor the Company Board shall approve or take any action to render
inapplicable to any Acquisition Proposal, Section 203 of the DGCL or any
similar takeover statute.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt) notify Parent orally or in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, or related inquiry or request for information of the
identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request and the material terms and conditions thereof, including price, and
any material modification of or amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, and
will take all reasonable steps to keep Parent fully apprised on a current
basis of any material related developments, discussions, and negotiations.

 

(c) The Company shall immediately (i) cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished to each such Person or its Representatives and (iii) terminate
access by each such Person and its Representatives to any online or other
electronic data rooms containing any information in respect of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, failure to take such action would be inconsistent with applicable
law; provided, however, that neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall make a Company Board Change of Recommendation except in
compliance with Section 5.06(e).

 

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.06(e), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw, qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser the recommendation or declaration of
advisability of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions,
(B) recommend that the stockholders of the Company reject this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the Transactions or (C) resolve, agree or publicly propose to
take any such actions (each such action set forth in this Section 5.06(e)(i)
being referred to herein as a _"Company Board Change of Recommendation"_ ),
(ii) recommend the approval or adoption of, or adopt or approve, any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Agreement or withdraw its approval of this
Agreement,

 



 



 

39

  or resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any of the foregoing actions or
(iii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an _"Acquisition
Agreement"_ ) constituting or related to, or which is intended to or could
reasonably be expected to result in, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in, and in accordance with, Section
5.06(a)), or resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.06(e) to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may,
if the Company Board determines in good faith, following consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action could reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary obligations
under applicable law, make a Company Board Change of Recommendation.
Notwithstanding any Company Board Change of Recommendation, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the stockholders for the purpose of seeking the Company
Stockholder Approval, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
the Company of such obligation prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VII hereof. At least four (4) Business Days prior to
making a Company Board Change of Recommendation, the Company shall notify
Parent in writing of the Company Boards intention to make such a Company
Board Change of Recommendation (which notice shall include the reasonable
details regarding the cause for, and nature of, the Company Board Change of
Recommendation) and shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors
to, during such period, negotiate with Parent and Purchaser in good faith (to
the extent Parent and Purchaser desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Company Board shall
take into account any changes to the financial and other terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to any such written notice by the
Company or otherwise, that would avoid such Company Board Change of
Recommendation.

 

5.07  _Takeover Laws and Provisions_.  No Party will take any action that
would cause the Transactions to be subject  to requirements imposed by any
Takeover Law and each of them will take all reasonable  steps within its
control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) such  Transactions
from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of,  any
applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. No Party will take 
any action that would cause the Transactions not to comply with any Takeover 
Provisions and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its
control  to make such Transactions comply with (or continue to comply with)
the Takeover  Provisions.

 

5.08  _Regulatory Applications_.

 

(a)  Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate
and  use all reasonable best efforts to prepare as promptly as possible all
documentation,  to effect all filings and, subject to Section 5.01, to obtain
all material permits,  consents, waivers, approvals, actions or nonactions
and authorizations of all  third parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary to consummate the Transactions  as promptly as practicable, and
will make all necessary filings in respect of  those Requisite Approvals as
soon as practicable. Each of Parent and the Company  will have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each  will consult with the
other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating  to the exchange of
information, with respect to all material written information  submitted to
any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with  the
Requisite Approvals. In

 



 



 

40

  exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties will act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each Party agrees that it will consult with the other
Party with respect to obtaining all Requisite Approvals and each Party will
keep the other Party apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the Transactions, including with respect to any material
communication with the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS or any other Governmental Authority
(or any of their respective representatives).

 

(b) Parent and the Company will, upon request, furnish the other Party with
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other Party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any third
party or Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and to the
extent permitted by the applicable Governmental Authority or any Person
objecting to the Transactions, give the other Party the opportunity to attend
and participate in any meetings and conferences with such Governmental
Authority or Person objecting to the Transactions.

 

(c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing,

 

(1) the Company and Parent shall promptly submit a joint filing and any
requested supplemental information (collectively, the _"Joint Filing"_ ) to
CFIUS pursuant to 31 C.F.R. Part 800 with regard to the Transactions, (ii)
Parent shall take responsibility for preparation and submission of the Joint
Filing and (iii) the Company hereby agrees promptly to provide to Parent all
necessary information and otherwise to assist Parent promptly in order for
Parent to complete preparation and submission of the Joint Filing in
accordance with this Section 5.08(c)(1) and respond to any inquiries from
CFIUS or any other interested Governmental Authority, and

 

(2) each Party shall (i) promptly take all actions reasonably necessary to (a)
file the notification and report form required for the Transactions and
provide any supplemental information in connection therewith pursuant to the
HSR Act and (b) make any filings required under any Applicable Antitrust Laws,
and shall furnish to the other such necessary information and assistance as
the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any
filing with, or submission or response to, inquires from the Federal Trade
Commission (the _"FTC"_ ), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
(the _"DOJ"_ ) or any other Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining approval under the HSR Act and any other Applicable Antitrust Laws,
(ii) keep the other Party apprised of the status of any inquiries or requests
for additional information from the FTC, or the DOJ or any Governmental
Authority in connection with obtaining approval under any such Applicable
Antitrust Laws and take all reasonable steps to comply promptly with any such
inquiry or request and (iii) participate in any interviews or meetings
reasonably requested by the FTC or the DOJ or any Governmental Authority in
connection with obtaining approval under any such Applicable Antitrust Laws in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

  5.09  _Indemnification_.

 

(a)  The Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation as at the
Effective Time  shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of  expenses, and exculpation of the Companys present and former
directors  and present officers (collectively, _"Indemnification 
Provisions"_ ) in a form substantially  similar to such provisions as
presently set forth in the Companys Constituent  Documents to the extent
applicable to actions or omissions before or at the  Effective Time. The
Indemnification Provisions of the Constituent Documents  of the Surviving
Corporation as in effect at the Effective Time shall not be  amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years and one  day
from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights 
thereunder of any individual who at the date hereof or at the Effective Time 
was a director or officer of the Company. Parent shall guarantee and stand
surety  for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in
accordance with  their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this Section 5.09.

 

(b) Without limiting Section 5.09(a) or any additional rights that an
employee, officer or director may have under any agreement or Benefit
Arrangement, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors and the
present officers of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of
investigation), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities as
incurred, in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising
out of actions or omissions in their capacity as directors or officers before
or at the Effective Time (including as to, or arising out of or pertaining to,
the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
(including and subject to Sections 145(a) and (b) of the DGCL), other than
actions or omissions constituting (i) criminal conduct or (ii) any violation
of federal, state or foreign securities laws.

 

(c) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company or Parent shall
purchase "run-off" insurance policies for directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability coverage with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time providing such coverages that are
no less favorable than the policies maintained by the Company as of the date
hereof, with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to all such coverage in an
amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies (the
_"Run-Off Policy"_ ). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain
and fully pay for the Run-Off Policy. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by the Company or any Company Subsidiary set forth in
Section 5.09(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. In the event that the
carriers do not make the Run-Off Policy available to the Company for any
reason, the Company shall endeavor to (and if the Company is unable to, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (after the Effective Time) obtain and
fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
(6) years from the Effective Time from the Companys current insurance
carriers or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to all such coverage in
an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at

 



 



 

42

  or prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company shall or
shall be obligated to make annual premium payments for such Run-Off Policy or
"tail" policy or, in the alternative, annual renewals of existing or
comparable coverages, which exceed 300% of the most recent annual premium paid
by the Company for such coverage prior to the date of this Agreement. If such
Run-Off Policy, "tail" policy or such other coverages cannot be obtained at
all, or can only be obtained at cost in excess of such maximum premium, then
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall obtain the most
advantageous insurance obtainable for an aggregate premium equal to the
maximum premium.

 

(d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.09, upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, will promptly notify Parent; provided, that failure so to
notify will not affect the obligations of Parent under this Section 5.09
unless and to the extent that Parent is actually and materially prejudiced as
a consequence.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any of the Indemnified Parties covered by
directors and officers liability insurance, on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.09 shall
continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.

 

(f) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (1) consolidates with or
merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or (2) transfers all or substantially all of its
assets to any other entity, then and in each case, Parent shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent will assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.09.

 

(g) The provisions of this Section 5.09 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and legal representatives. The
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an indemnified officer or director is entitled, whether
pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

 

(h) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees and reasonable costs of investigation, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing all obligations provided in this Section 5.09
in the event such Indemnified Party prevails in connection with enforcing such
obligations.

 

5.10  _Employee Matters_. 

 

(a)  From the Effective Time until December 31, 2008 (such date being
referred to  herein as the " _Benefits Transition  Date_ "), Parent shall
provide the  employees and former employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the  Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ")  with
employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements
(including  base salary and annual bonus opportunities) substantially
comparable, in the  aggregate (excluding the value of equity awards), to
those provided by the Company  or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to
such Covered Employees immediately  prior to the

 



 



 

43

  Effective Time. Nothing provided in this Section 5.10(a) shall prevent Parent
from terminating any employee subject to applicable severance obligations or
agreements or Benefit Arrangements in accordance with their terms. Parent
acknowledges that consummation of the Merger shall constitute a "change in
control" or "change of control" within the meaning of the agreements set forth
in Schedule 5.10 and in any Benefit Arrangement to the extent that such
Benefit Arrangement includes that or any similar term.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall (1) provide all Covered
Employees with service credit (for purposes of eligibility (including
eligibility for retirement), participation, vesting, levels of benefits and
benefit accruals (other than benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan) under any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement
adopted, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
which Covered Employees are eligible to participate), for all periods of
employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor
entities) prior to the Effective Time to the extent credited by the Company
for purposes of a comparable plan (provided that there will be no duplication
of benefits) and (2) cause any pre-existing conditions, limitations,
eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any
welfare benefit plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to be waived with
respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent
waived under the corresponding plan (for a comparable level of coverage) in
which the applicable Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If the Companys medical and/or dental benefit plans for
Covered Employees are terminated prior to the end of a plan year, Covered
Employees and their dependents who are then participating in a deductible-
based medical and/or dental plan sponsored by the Company will be given credit
for deductibles and eligible out-of-pocket expenses incurred towards
deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums during the portion of the plan year
preceding the termination date in a comparable deductible-based medical and/or
dental plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for the corresponding Parent
benefit plan year.

 

(c) Parent and the Company shall honor, or cause to be honored, in accordance
with their terms, all vested or accrued benefit obligations to, and
contractual rights of, Covered Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including any benefits or rights arising as a result of the Merger (either
alone or in combination with any other event).

 

(d) Parent shall maintain a bonus plan for Covered Employees for the remainder
of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2007, on substantially the same terms
and conditions in the aggregate and pursuant to substantially the same targets
and performance measures in the aggregate as were in effect for the Company so
adopted for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2007 (the _"2007 Bonus Plan"_
). The Companys performance in respect of calculations made under the 2007
Bonus Plan shall be calculated without taking into account any expenses or
costs associated with or arising as a result of the Transactions or any
nonrecurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been
incurred had the Transactions not occurred and shall not be subject to
reduction or negative discretion by the administrator of the 2007 Bonus Plan.

 

5.11  _Notification of Certain Matters_.  Parent and the Company will give
prompt notice to the other of any fact, event  or circumstance known to it
that would cause or constitute a breach of any of  its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that  would be

 



 



 

44

  reasonably likely to cause a condition in Article VI not to be capable of
being satisfied by the Termination Date.

 

5.12  _Certain Tax Matters_. 

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (A) timely prepare and file all
material Tax Returns required to be filed for any taxable period that ends on
or before the Effective Time ( _"Post-Signing Returns"_ ) consistent with past
practice; (B) timely pay all material Taxes due and payable with respect to
the taxable periods covered by such Post-Signing Returns; (C) accrue a reserve
in the books and records and financial statements consistent with past
practice for all Taxes payable by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for
which no Post-Signing Return is due prior to the Effective Time; (D) promptly
notify Parent of any material claim, audit, suit, proceeding or other action
pending against or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
respect of any material Tax; and (E) not make or change any material Tax
election, enter into any closing agreement with respect to Taxes, file any
amended Tax Return, change any method of Tax accounting, request any ruling
relating to Taxes, or surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, in each case,
without Parents prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(b) The Company shall not and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into or effect any transaction that would result in the recognition of
material taxable income or gain by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
other than the transactions expressly required or allowed by this Agreement or
transactions entered into or effected in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, without Parents prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

5.13  _Stockholder Litigation; Investigations_  

 

(a) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and
its directors relating to any of the Transactions; provided, however, that no
such settlement shall be proposed or agreed to without Parents consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly advise Parent and keep it reasonably informed
on a current basis of the status or progress of any material investigation or
proceeding against or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the
directors, officers or employees thereof, conducted by any Governmental
Authority or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) and shall (i) permit
Parent or its counsel to participate (at Parents option) in the conduct of
such investigation (including document review and interviews), in the review
of the results thereof and in any related meetings and the communications with
any Governmental Authority subject to advice of counsel that such
participation will not adversely affect the Companys attorney-client
privilege and (ii) not agree to any settlement or other restriction,
requirement or material action by, or applicable to, the Company (or any
portion thereof) for any of its Subsidiaries (or any portion thereof) without
prior advance good faith consultation with Parent.

(a) By mutual written consent of the Parent and the Company;

 



 



 

47

  (b) By either Parent or the Company:

 

(i) if any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling (whether

and has the effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger; provided, that the Party

Agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company,
on the other hand (provided that the terminating Party (and, if Parent is the
terminating Party, Purchaser) is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), such
that the terminating Party would be entitled to not consummate the Merger
pursuant to Article VI, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days
after giving written notice to the breaching Party;

 

(iii) if the Merger shall not have occurred on or before the one hundred
twentieth (120th) day after the date hereof (the _"Termination Date"_ );
provided, that if any of the Requisite Approvals have not been received (and
are still pending with applicable Governmental Authorities), Parent or the
Company may extend the Termination Date for an additional period of up to
ninety (90) days in order to obtain the Requisite Approvals by providing
written notice thereof to the other; provided, further, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.01(b)(iii) shall not be
available to any Party that has breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement which breach shall have been a principal
cause of, or resulted in, the failure to consummate the Merger by such date;
or 

 

(iv) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained by
reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the Stockholders Meeting
duly convened for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval or
any adjournment or postponement thereof.

 

(c)  By the Company, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval,  solely in response to a Superior Proposal that was unsolicited and
that did  not otherwise result from a breach of Section 5.06; provided,
however, that  (A) no such termination of this Agreement by the Company may
be made, in each  case until after the fourth (4th) Business Day following
Parents  receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the
Company  Board intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.01(c) and  specifying in writing all material terms and conditions of, and
the identity  of any Person making, the Superior Proposal (which notice shall
include a copy  of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the
party making such Superior  Proposal and

 



 



 

48

  other material documents), during which period the Company shall, and shall
cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent and Purchaser
in good faith (to the extent Parent and Purchaser desire to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the financial and other
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to any such written
notice by the Company or otherwise, so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases
to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notice by the Company and a new five Business Day
period) and (B) the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.01(c), and any purported termination pursuant to this Section
7.01(c) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless (x) the Company shall
have complied with all applicable requirements of Section 5.06 (including the
notice provisions thereof) and Section 7.03 (including the payment of the
Break-Up Fee in accordance with the requirements thereof), (y) such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (z) the
Company shall concurrently enter into a binding Acquisition Agreement for such
Superior Proposal.

 

(d) By Parent if (i) the Company Board has made a Company Board Change of
Recommendation or (ii) the Company Board shall fail to reaffirm its
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions within ten
(10) Business Days of receipt of Parents written request at any time when an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made and not rejected by the Company
Board; provided Parent terminates this Agreement by providing written notice
thereof to the Company within ten (10) days after such Company Board Change of
Recommendation or failure to reaffirm.

 

7.02  _Effect of Termination_.  In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01,  this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on  the part of any Party hereto or any
of its Affiliates, directors, officers or  stockholders except that the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, may have  liability or obligations as
set forth in Sections 4.03(q)(1), 4.04(g), 5.04,  5.05(b), 7.02 and 7.03 and
as set forth in or contemplated by Section 7.01  hereof and except that
Article VIII shall remain in effect. Nothing in this  Section 7.02 shall
relieve any Party from liability for any material and intentional  breach of
this Agreement.

 

7.03  _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid
by the Party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(b)(ii), then Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company (but in
no event later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such
termination) for its Transaction Expenses by payment made by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated by the Company.

 

(c) In the event that

 



 



 

49

  (i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company or its
stockholders or an Acquisition Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly
known, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) or 7.01(b)(iv) and (C) at any time on
or prior to twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (x) enters into any Acquisition Agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (y) the transactions contemplated by
any Acquisition Proposal are consummated, or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(c);
or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i) or
(ii),

 

then, in each case, the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to
$140,000,000.00 (the _"Break-Up Fee"_ ) by wire transfer of same day funds to
an account designated by Parent (x) in the case of a termination by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(c), prior to or simultaneously with such
termination, (y) in the case of a termination by Parent pursuant to Section
7.01(d)(i) or (ii), within three (3) Business Days after such termination and
(z) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to clause (x)
or (y) of Section 7.03(c)(i)(C), upon the earlier of execution of such
Acquisition Agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by such
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Sections 7.03(b)
and 7.03(c) are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, they would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if a Party
fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to Section 7.03(b) or
7.03(c), as applicable, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other Party
commences a claim, suit, proceeding or other action that results in a judgment
against such first Party, such first Party shall pay to the other Party
interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such amount was
due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate of Citibank,
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 1%,
together with reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with
such claim, suit, proceeding or other action.

 

 **ARTICLE  VIII**

 

 **M** **ISCELLANEOUS**

 

8.01  _Survival_.  The representations, warranties, agreements and covenants
contained in this  Agreement. including any rights arising out of any breach
of such representations,  warranties, agreements and covenants, will not
survive the Effective Time. This  Section 8.01 shall not limit any covenant

provision of this Agreement may  be (a) waived by the Party benefited by the
provision, but only in writing,  or (b) amended or modified at any time, but
only by a written agreement executed  in the same

 



 



 

50

  manner as this Agreement, except to the extent that any such amendment would
violate applicable law or require submission or resubmission of this Agreement
or the Plan of Merger contained herein to the stockholders of the Company. The
failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

8.03  _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will  be deemed to constitute an original.

 

8.04  _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue_.  This Agreement shall be
governed by, and will be interpreted in accordance with,  the laws of the
State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed  entirely
within that State, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern  under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Each of Parent,
Purchaser,  and the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally; (i)
consents to submit  to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located in the  State of Delaware ( _"Delaware Courts"_ )  for any
litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the Transactions 
(and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such
courts),  (ii) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
litigation in the  Delaware Courts, (iii) agrees not to plead or claim in any
Delaware Court that  such litigation brought therein has been brought in any
inconvenient forum or  attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request  for leave from any such court, and (iv) waives
any right to trial by jury with  respect to any action related to or arising
out of this Agreement or any transaction  contemplated hereby.

 

8.05  _Notices_.  All notices, requests and other communications given or

8.06  _Entire Understanding; No Third Party  Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
taken  together with the Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitutes  the entire agreement and understanding among the
Parties regarding the Transactions  and supersedes any and all other oral or
written agreements and understandings  previously made or purported to be
made with respect thereto. No representation,  warranty, inducement, promise,
understanding or condition not set forth in this  Agreement has been made or
relied on by any Party in entering into this Agreement.  Except for Article
II, and Section 5.09, which is intended to benefit the  Indemnified Parties,
nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended  to confer any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other  than
Parent and the Company.

 

8.07  _Severability_.  If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any Person  or circumstance is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid,  void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions,
or the application of such  provision to Persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it has been  held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in
full force and effect and will  in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated thereby, so long as the economic  or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially  adverse to any Party.
Upon any such determination, the Parties will negotiate  in good faith in an
effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute  provision to effect
the original intent of the Parties.

 

8.08  _Assignment; Successors._ No  Party may assign either this Agreement
or any of the rights, interests or obligations  under this Agreement, or
delegate any of its duties hereunder, in whole or in  part, without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, except that Purchaser  may assign, in
its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and  obligations
under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly  owned
subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of  any
of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without 
such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentences,
this  Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by,  the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 



 



 

52

  8.09  _Remedies._ The  Parties agree that irreparable damage will occur in
the event that any of the  provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific  terms or are otherwise breached, and the
Parties further agree they shall be  entitled to an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce  specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, this remedy being in  addition to any other
remedy to which the Parties are entitled at law or in  equity.

  _EXHIBIT A_

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

 

SURVIVING CORPORATION

 

ARTICLE I

 

The name of the corporation (hereinafter called the " _Corporation_ ") is [
].

 

ARTICLE II

 

The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware is
1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware. The name of the
registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.

 

ARTICLE III

 

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation shall
have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock having the par value
of $0.01 per share.

 

ARTICLE V

 

The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
the Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to adopt,
amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 



  ARTICLE VII

 

Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws of the Corporation so require,
the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

To the fullest extent from time to time permitted by law, no director of the
Corporation shall be personally liable to any extent to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his fiduciary duty as a
director.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

(1) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the
fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding
if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person
seeking indemnification did not act in good faith and in a manner which he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The right to
indemnification conferred upon such persons by this Article IX shall be a
contract right.

 

(2) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses
(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification
shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such
person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and
only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the
court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the

 



 



 

-ii-

  circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court
shall deem proper.

 

(3) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections (1) and (2) of this Article
IX, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.

 

(4) Any indemnification under Sections (1) and (2) of this Article IX (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director,
officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in such Sections (1) and (2).
Such determination shall be made (a) by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were
not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (b) if such quorum is not
obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so
directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (c) by the
stockholders of the Corporation.

 

(5) Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director in
defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or
proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition
of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such director or officer at the commencement of such action, suit or
proceeding to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he
is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation authorized in this
Article IX. Such expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by other
employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as
the Board of Directors of the Corporation deems appropriate.

 

(6) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, the other sections of this Article IX shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under law, by-law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.

 

(7) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of Section 145 of
the General Corporation Law.

 



 



 

-iii-

  (8) For purposes of this Article IX, references to "the Corporation" shall
include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation
(including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or
merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power
and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents so
that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such
constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation, as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article IX with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with
respect to such consistent corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

 

(9) For purposes of this Article IX, references to "other enterprises" shall
include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise
taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and
references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any
service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which
imposes duties on, or involves service by, such director, officer, employee or
agent with respect to any employee benefit plan, its participants or
beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to
in this Article IX.

 

(10) The indemnification and advance of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article IX shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized
or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.
