The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date." For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Business Day" shall mean a day other than (a) Saturday or Sunday or (b) any other day on which banks in the city and state of New York or in Hamilton, Bermuda are permitted or required to be closed.

 2.06 _ Effect on Shares._ Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Amalgamation and without any action on the part of Amalgamation Sub, the Company, Parent as the holder of the shares of Amalgamation Sub or the holders of common shares, par value U.S.$0.01 per share (the "Company Shares"), of the Company: 

  

  

 (a) _ Amalgamation Consideration._ Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive U.S.$22.52 in cash (without interest, subject to applicable withholding for Taxes, levies, imposts or other governmental charges) (the "Amalgamation Consideration"). At the Effective Time, the Company Shares shall no longer be issued and outstanding and each certificate (a "Certificate") representing any Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall represent only the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration. At the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall be converted into only the right to receive the value thereof as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Excluded Shares" means 

  

      

  

(A) Company Shares that are owned by Parent, Amalgamation Sub or any other
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent (not held on behalf of, or as security

any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company (not held on behalf of, or as
security for obligations owed by, third parties) and (C) Company Shares
("Dissenting Shares") that are held by any registered holder (each, a
"Dissenting Shareholder") that has properly dissented pursuant to Section
106(6) of the Companies Act.

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Shares._ Each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be issued and outstanding and shall be cancelled without any conversion or payment of any consideration therefor. 

  

 (c) _ Amalgamation Sub._ Each share of Amalgamation Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued and fully paid Amalgamated Company Share. 

  

 (d) _ Dissenters\' Rights._ The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of the existence of any Dissenting Shareholders, attempted withdrawals of applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the shares and any other documents served pursuant to the Companies Act and received by the Company relating to any Dissenting Shareholder\'s rights to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shareholder\'s Company Shares, as provided in Section 106 of the Companies Act and (ii) the opportunity to direct and conduct any and all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Shares, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

  

 2.07 _ Exchange of Certificates; Payment of Amalgamation Consideration._ (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company selected by Parent, with the Company\'s prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares other than Excluded Shares, cash in respect of the aggregate Amalgamation Consideration in exchange for issued and outstanding Company Shares upon due surrender of the Certificates and other materials pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). Parent will cause the Amalgamated Company to cause the Paying Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to make the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement. The Paying Agent shall invest any funds held by it for purposes of this Section 2.07 as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. The Amalgamated Company shall pay to Dissenting Shareholders the fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with the requirements of Sections 106(6A) and 106(6B) of the Companies Act. 

  

 (b) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Amalgamated Company to cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent and which sets forth the procedures by which holders of Certificates, and the holders of book shares, which are uncertificated, may receive the Amalgamation Consideration. Upon a holder complying with such procedures, the Paying Agent will deliver to such holders cash in an amount (without interest, subject to applicable withholding for Taxes, levies, imposts or other governmental charges) equal to the number of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) owned by such person immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Amalgamation Consideration. All such Certificates shall forthwith be canceled and book accounts shall be canceled. If payment is to 

        
  

be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
surrendered or book account is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that all documentation for a book account
transfer is received and that the Person requesting such payment pay any
transfer or similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder or establish to the satisfaction of the Amalgamated
Company that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

   

 (c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Amalgamated Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Amalgamated Company may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Amalgamation Consideration with respect to the Company Shares formerly represented thereby. 

  

 (d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Amalgamated Company. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not complied with Section 2.07(b) prior to the end of such six-month period shall thereafter look only to the Amalgamated Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of their claim for the Amalgamation Consideration. Neither Parent, Amalgamation Sub nor the Amalgamated Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates (or book shares) shall not have been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date as shall be immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law), unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates (or book shares) shall become the property of the Amalgamated Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 2.08 _ Adjustments to Prevent Dilution._ If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, in either case by reason of a share consolidation, reclassification, share split (including a reverse share split), share dividend or distribution, recapitalization, amalgamation, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Amalgamation Consideration shall be equitably adjusted. 

   

 2.09 _ Stock Options._ Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option (whether or not then vested or exercisable) to purchase Company Shares granted to Employees, directors, or independent contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any stock option or stock incentive plan (or agreement related thereto) of the Company (each, a "Company Incentive Plan") that is outstanding at such time (each, a "Company Stock Option") shall be canceled, and the former holder of each such canceled Company Stock Option, without any action on the part of such former holder and in full consideration of such cancellation, shall be entitled to receive, at the Effective Time, from the Company with respect to each Company Share previously issuable under such canceled Company Stock Option an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the excess, if any, of the Amalgamation Consideration over the then applicable exercise price per Company Share of such Company Stock Option. After the Effective Time, former holders of canceled Company Stock Options shall have no further rights in respect of such canceled Company Stock Options.

Each Party agrees to make or cause to be made such filings as promptly as practicable, and in any event within the time frame provided in Section 6.03(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested by Governmental Authorities pursuant to any applicable Law, and to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with and subject to this Section 6.03 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, and grant of any necessary approvals, consistent with the consents set forth in Section 3.08(a) and the conditions set forth in Article VIII. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties shall request and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period provided for under the HSR Act. In addition, the Parties shall make necessary filings and use reasonable best efforts to obtain completion of a review of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("CFIUS") pursuant to Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 ("Exon-Florio Review"). 

  

 (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.03(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate to prosecute each application for approval with reasonable diligence and otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the grants of the applications as expeditiously as practicable, including the exercise of reasonable diligence to comply with any request from a Governmental Authority for additional documents, information or materials; (ii) cooperate in all respects with the other Party in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (iii) notify the other Party promptly following any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to any Governmental Authority, and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party and, in each case, provide the other Party with a copy of any written communication promptly after the receipt thereof; and (iv) oppose any petitions to deny or other objections filed with respect to the applications for any FCC approval, including any administrative or judicial review and any requests for reconsideration or review of any FCC approval,

connection with the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall furnish to each
other such information as they each shall reasonably request in connection
with the prosecution of applications and other legal proceedings in connection
with this transaction. Parent and the Company each shall have the right to

on, all information relating to the other Party, that may appear in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Government Authority or
third party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereunder. Each of the Company and Parent shall take or cause to
be taken all actions necessary, appropriate or desirable to be taken by the
Company and Parent (and their respective Affiliates) to permit the FCC to
approve the FCC transfer or assignment application within the time
frame contemplated in Section 9.02(a), except that neither the Parent, and
its Affiliates, nor the Company, and its Affiliates, shall be required to take
any action that would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or have a Modified Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained in Sections 6.03(a) and 6.03(b), each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with any Required Approvals. In connection with the foregoing, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of applicable Law, each of the Parties shall cooperate in all respects with the other Parties and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.03 or any other provision in this Agreement shall (i) limit a Party\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or (c) so long as such Party has theretofore complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.03, or (ii) require Parent to agree to (A) any conditions that would require the sale of one or more satellites of Parent and its Subsidiaries in operation or authorized as of the date hereof and set forth in Section 6.03(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or Company Satellites, or impose any other requirement that would materially diminish the usefulness of any such satellites or the right to replace or renew the rights to operate any such satellites or (B) any conditions that impose other limitations on Parent\'s ownership or operation of any portion of the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' business or assets, or (C) any other obligation, restriction, limitation, qualification or other conditions that, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), would be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Modified Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) require the Company to agree to any dispositions, limitations, consents, commitments, agreements or other material actions, other than any disposition, limitation, consent, commitment agreement or other action that in each such case may be conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

In particular, without limitation, the Company 

        
  

shall (i) in cooperation with Parent, to the extent possible without
triggering tax liabilities, use its reasonable best efforts to liquidate the
intermediate companies between the Company and NS B.V. and to repay
intercompany debt among such companies and/or NS B.V., and (ii) in cooperation
with Parent, develop a plan to complete, after Closing, such steps in the
liquidation of the intermediate companies or repayment of intercompany debt
which cannot be completed prior to Closing without triggering tax liabilities.

 6.04 _ Acquisition Proposals._ (a) The Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and each officer, director, employee, consultant, financial advisor, auditor, investment banker, attorney, accountant, agent or other advisor or representative (collectively, the "Representatives") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) the making by any Person (other than the parties hereto) of any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to or in connection with, or take any other action to facilitate, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries with respect to, or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or approve or recommend or propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to an Acquisition Proposal (or resolve or authorize or propose to agree to do any of the foregoing); _provided_ that nothing contained in this Section 6.04(a) shall prohibit the Company from furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement, if (i) the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) prior to its receipt of confidential information such Person enters into a confidentiality and standstill agreement with the Company and to the extent the terms therein are in substance less favorable to the Company or more favorable to such Person than the corresponding terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (the "Revised Confidentiality Terms"), the Company provides Parent with a copy of the Revised Confidentiality Terms and agrees that the corresponding terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement shall, if so requested by Parent, be amended (including, if there are no corresponding Revised Confidentiality Terms, by deleting the relevant provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement) so that they are substantially similar to the Revised Confidentiality Terms, (iii) the Required Company Vote has not yet been obtained and (iv) the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith following the receipt of advice of counsel that doing so is consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company shall notify Parent of having received any written Acquisition Proposal (and provide a copy thereof) promptly, and in any event no later than twenty-four hours after its receipt thereof, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis as to the status of any such proposals and any such discussions or negotiations, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to the status thereof and of any definitive oral or written modifications to the terms of any Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of such proposals, within 24 hours of such modification. The Company agrees that it and its respective Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from providing such information to Parent. The Company agrees that (i) neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement relating to the sale or other disposition of the Company or any material portion of its or any of its Subsidiaries\' equity interests or assets to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is 

        
  

a party, except for such changes to a standstill or confidentiality agreement
that is in effect on the date hereof that are made in order for the Company to
comply with the provisions of clause (ii) in the proviso to the first
sentence of this Section 6.04(a) and (ii) that it and its Subsidiaries shall
enforce the provisions of any such agreement by appropriate commercially
reasonable action. Immediately after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their
Representatives to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions
or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
possible Acquisition Proposal unless such Persons make an unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal following the date hereof and the Company has
complied with the provisions of this Section 6.04(a) in all material respects
in respect thereof. Nothing in this Section 6.04 shall permit the Company to
terminate this Agreement or affect any other obligation of the Company under
this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Sections 9.03(b)).

  

 (b) "Superior Proposal" shall mean an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal with respect to which the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal advisors and taking into account all relevant factors, including the identity of the offeror and all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including the terms of any financing, that (x) if accepted, such Acquisition Proposal would result in a transaction more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company\'s shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) is reasonably capable of being consummated; _provided_ that to be a Superior Proposal, the consummation of one or more steps in an Acquisition Proposal must result in a third party (or the shareholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the common shares of the Company (or the surviving or ultimate parent entity in such transaction) or, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

  

 (c) The board of directors (or any authorized committee thereof) of the Company will not withdraw, modify or amend, or propose to withdraw, modify or amend, in any manner adverse to Parent, its recommendation that the Company shareholders vote in favor of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or publicly announce any intention to do so) unless (i) an unsolicited bona fide written Superior Proposal is pending at the time the board of directors of the Company determines to take any such action, (ii) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with this Section 6.04, and (iii) the Company shall have notified Parent at least five Business Days in advance of its intention to effect such withdrawal, modification or amendment and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent during such five Business Day period (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such proposal would no longer be determined in good faith by the board of directors of the Company to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

   

 (d) Nothing herein shall limit the Company\'s ability to comply in good faith, to the extent applicable, with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 of the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or exchange offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company\'s board of directors (nor any committee thereof) shall (i) recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their common stock in the Company in connection with any such tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) withdraw or modify the company recommendation, unless in each case the requirements of this Section 6.04 shall have been satisfied. 

  

 6.05 _ Public Announcements._ Each of Parent and the Company will consult with the other and provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon, before issuing any press release, making any filing with the SEC or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement and shall not issue any such press release, make any such SEC filing or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, the Company\'s articles of association or bye-laws or under any listing agreement or applicable rules of any securities exchange. 

       

    

  6.06 _ Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance._
(a) From and after the Closing and for a period of six years, Parent shall
cause the Amalgamated Company to and the Amalgamated Company shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, the present and former directors and officers of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") from and against all Losses
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
related to the fact that such person was a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, arising out of pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Amalgamation and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Amalgamation
Agreement), or taken by them at the request of the Company or any the Company
Subsidiary, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of reasonable
expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from the Amalgamated Company
within ten Business Days of receipt by the Amalgamated Company from
the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the
extent required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. The
Amalgamated Company shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any proceeding or threatened Action (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party), unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents.

   

 (b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions in favor of the Indemnified Parties occurring prior to or at the Effective Time as provided in the Company\'s memorandum of association or bye-laws or in any agreement listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by the Amalgamated Company from and after the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms from the Closing until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) The Company may obtain as of the Closing "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Closing with respect to the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the coverage applicable to the Company\'s director\'s and officers for the period from November 2, 2005 through the Closing Date (the "Tail Policy"). The premium of such Tail Policy shall be no more than the amount set forth on Section 6.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If the Company does not obtain the Tail Policy prior to the Closing, for a period of six years from the Closing, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect policies of at least the same coverage as the policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof for the benefit of those persons who are covered by such policies on the Closing Date with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Closing, to the extent that such liability insurance can be maintained at a cost to Parent not greater than 200 percent of the last annual premium for the current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ that, if such insurance cannot be so maintained or obtained at such cost, Parent shall cause the Company to maintain or obtain as much of such insurance as can be so maintained or obtained (not to exceed six years from the Closing Date) at a cost equal to 200 percent of the last annual premium for such insurance. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Closing Date) is made against any party covered by directors\' and officers\' liability insurance, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the provisions of this Section 6.06 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

  

 6.07 _ Notification of Certain Matters._ The Company shall, upon obtaining knowledge of any of the following, give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall, upon obtaining knowledge of any of the

If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 10.08 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. 

  

 10.09 _ Interpretation._ (a) The words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and article, section, paragraph, exhibit and schedule references are to the articles, sections, paragraphs, exhibits and schedules of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings contained herein when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such terms. Any statute defined or referred to herein means such statute as from time to time amended, qualified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor statutes. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. 

  

  

 (b) The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the information referred to has been actually delivered to the Party to whom such information is to be made available. 

  

 (c) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.
