ARTICLE II



EFFECT OF THE MERGERS ON CAPITAL STOCK, COMMON

_SHARES, WARRANTS, COMPANY OPTIONS AND PARTNERSHIP UNITS_  



Section 2.1. _Effect of REIT Merger on Capital Stock, Common Shares and
Warrants_. At the REIT Effective Time, by virtue of the REIT Merger and
without any action on the part of any of the Purchaser Parties, the Company or
the holder of any equity interests of Merger Sub or common shares
of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "
_Common Shares_ "):



(a) _Conversion of Common Shares_. Each Common Share (other than Excluded
Shares (as defined in _Section 2.1(b)_ ) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the REIT Effective Time (including all Common Shares issued after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the REIT Effective Time in exchange for LP
Units in accordance with the terms of such LP Units) (such Common Shares
are each hereinafter referred to as a " _Share_ " and collectively as the
"Shares"), shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $6.70 in
cash, without interest (the " _REIT Merger Consideration_ "). At the REIT
Effective Time, all Shares shall be cancelled automatically and shall cease to
exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the REIT
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease
to have any rights with respect to the Shares, other than the right to
receive the REIT Merger Consideration per share (without any interest being
payable thereon) upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with
_Section 2.2_.



(b) _Cancellation of Certain Common Shares and Purchaser Party-Owned
Common Shares_. Each Common Share issued and outstanding and owned by the
Company, the Operating Partnership, or any of their respective wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, or by the Purchaser Parties, or any of their wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, immediately prior to the REIT Effective Time (collectively, the
" _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be cancelled automatically and shall cease to
exist, without payment of any consideration being made in respect thereof.



(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Equity Interests_. The equity interests
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the REIT Effective
Time shall be converted automatically into and become fully paid and non-
assessable common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Entity (the " _Surviving Entity Shares_ "). The number of
Surviving Entity Shares shall be equal to the equity capitalization of Merger
Sub divided by $6.70.



(d) _Series B Shares_. The REIT Merger shall have no effect on the Companys
outstanding Series B Shares and, at and after the REIT Effective Time, the
Series B Shares shall be the outstanding Series B Shares of the Surviving
Entity.



 

-4- (e) _Warrants_. The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to assure
that, as of the REIT Effective Time, each Warrant, by virtue of the REIT
Merger and without any further action on the part of the Purchaser Parties,
the Company or the holder of such Warrant, shall be (i) converted
automatically into the right upon exercise to acquire and receive, in lieu of
the Common Shares otherwise acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of
such Warrant immediately prior to the REIT Effective Time, an aggregate amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the per share REIT
Merger Consideration and (y) the maximum number of Common Shares subject to
such Warrant (after giving effect to the adjustment set forth in clause (ii)
of this sentence) (with respect to such Warrant, this product is referred to
as the "Warrant REIT Merger Consideration") and (ii) modified automatically
to provide that (x) the Exercise Price (as defined in such Warrant) is
adjusted to $6.70 per Common Share (the " _Adjusted Exercise Price_ ") subject
to such Warrant and (y) the maximum number of Common Shares subject to such
Warrant is adjusted to 559,701 Common Shares in the case of the Series A-2
Share Purchase Warrant, 373,134 Common Shares in the case of the Series
B Share Purchase Warrant and 466,418 Common Shares in the case of the Series
C Share Purchase Warrant. From and after the REIT Effective Time, the
Warrants, as so converted and modified in accordance with this _Section
2.1(e)_ , shall be exercisable solely for the per share Warrant REIT Merger
Consideration (in exchange for the payment by the holder(s) of the Warrants to
the Company of the Adjusted Exercise Price), and shall not be exercisable for
the purchase of Common Shares.



(f) _Series A Shares_. If requested by the Purchaser Parties, the Company
shall take such actions as are necessary to convert all issued and outstanding
Series A Shares to Common Shares before the REIT Effective Time. Any such
converted Common Shares shall be automatically cancelled at the REIT
Effective Time in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_.



(g) _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters, appraisal or similar rights shall
be available with respect to the REIT Merger.



Section 2.2. _Surrender of Certificates_.



(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the OP Effective Time, the Purchaser Parties
shall (i) select a bank or trust company to act as the paying agent in the OP
Merger and the REIT Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and (ii) enter into an
agreement with the Paying Agent. The identity of the Paying Agent and the
terms and conditions of the agreement with the Paying Agent shall be subject
to the prior approval of the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.



(b) _Payment Fund_. On the Closing Date and prior to the OP Effective Time,
the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent, (i) subject to Section 3.2
(c)(iii), any unrestricted cash of the Company to the extent required by the
Purchaser Parties and (ii) only to the extent the Commercial Properties Sale
is completed, the Companys share of the proceeds from the Commercial
Properties Sale, if any, and, on the Closing Date and prior to the OP
Effective Time, the Purchaser Parties shall deposit with the Paying Agent
such additional amounts as are necessary for the payment of, in each case for
the benefit of the holders of Eligible LP Units and Shares for exchange in
accordance with this _Article II_ and for the benefit of the holders of
Company Options for payment in accordance with _Section 2.3(a)_ , the
aggregate



 

-5- OP Merger Consideration, REIT Merger Consideration and Option Merger
Consideration. Such funds provided to the Paying Agent are referred to herein
as the " _Payment Fund_." The Paying Agent shall make payments of the OP
Merger Consideration, REIT Merger Consideration and Option Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement, the OP Merger Certificate
and the Articles of Merger. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. Any and all interest earned on the Payment Fund shall be paid to the
Surviving Entity.



(c) _Payment Procedures_.



(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly after the REIT Effective Time, but in no
event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter, the Surviving Entity shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate at
the REIT Effective Time (A) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which
letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including
provisions for the delivery of certificates of non-foreign status) as the
Purchaser Parties shall reasonably specify and to which the Company shall
reasonably approve prior to the Effective Time and (B) instructions for
surrendering the Certificates.



 

(ii) _Surrender of Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or such agent or agents as the Purchaser
Parties may designate, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and
any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent and reasonably
approved by the Company prior to the Effective Time (including, if
applicable, duly executed certificates of non-foreign status), the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable REIT Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Certificate
less any required withholding of Taxes in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.
Any Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled immediately. No interest
shall accrue or be paid on any amount payable upon surrender of the
Certificates.



(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any REIT Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, then the REIT Merger Consideration may be paid to
such a transferee so long as (A) the surrendered Certificate is accompanied
by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and
(B) the Person requesting such payment (1) pays any applicable transfer taxes
or (2) establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchaser Parties and
the Paying Agent that such taxes have already been paid or are not
applicable.



(iv) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this _Section
2.2(c)_ , each Certificate shall be deemed, except as provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law, from and after the REIT Effective Time, to
represent for all purposes solely the right to receive the applicable REIT
Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof. Payment of the REIT
Merger Consideration upon the surrender of any Certificate shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to that
Certificate and the Shares formerly represented by it. The Option Merger
Consideration paid with respect to Company Options in accordance with this
_Article II_



 

-6- and _Section 2.3(a)_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the cancelled Company Options and on and after the
REIT Effective Time the holder of a Company Option shall have no further
rights to exercise any Company Option.



(d) _No Further Transfers_. Upon and after the REIT Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Common Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the REIT Effective Time. If, after the REIT Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for cash as provided in this _Article II_.



(e) _Required Withholding_. The Purchaser Parties and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any REIT Merger Consideration or
Option Merger Consideration, as the case may be, payable under this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under (i)
the Code or (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.



(f) _No Liability_. Neither the Purchaser Parties nor the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any holder of Certificates or Company Options for any amount
properly paid from the Payment Fund or delivered to a public official under
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund as directed by the Purchaser Parties. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall be deemed property of, and shall
be paid promptly to, the Surviving Entity. Any losses resulting from such
investment shall not in any way diminish the Purchaser Parties obligation to
pay the full amount of the aggregate OP Merger Consideration, REIT Merger
Consideration and Option Merger Consideration.



(h) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Company Options nine
(9) months after the REIT Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying
Agent to the Surviving Entity upon demand, which shall hold such amounts for
the holders of Certificates or Company Options (to the extent the Option
Merger Consideration is payable in respect of such Company Options). Any
holder of Certificates or Company Options who has not complied with this
_Article II_ shall look thereafter only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the applicable REIT Merger Consideration or Option Merger
Consideration, as the case may be, without interest on such REIT Merger
Consideration or Option Merger Consideration and only as general creditors
thereof. If any Certificates or Company Options shall not have
been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any REIT Merger
Consideration or Option Merger Consideration, as the case may be, would
otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law,
the REIT Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Certificates or Company Options shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and at the option of the Surviving Entity, on the Business
Day immediately prior to such date become the property of Surviving Entity,
free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.



 

-7- (i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable and customary form and amount as the Surviving Entity may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Entity
with respect to the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate,
the Paying Agent shall pay the REIT Merger Consideration to such Person in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.



Section 2.3. _Company Options_.



(a) The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to assure that, as
of the REIT Effective Time, each option to acquire Common Shares (each, a "
_Company Option_ ") issued under the Company Share Incentive Plan and
outstanding immediately prior to the REIT Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, by virtue of the REIT Merger and without any further
action on the part of the Purchaser Parties, the Company or the holder of that
Company Option, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess of
the REIT Merger Consideration per share over the exercise or purchase price
per share of such Company Option, and (y) the number of Common Shares subject
thereto (the aggregate of such amounts hereinafter referred to as the "
_Option Merger Consideration_ "). The payment of the Option Merger
Consideration to the holder of a Company Option shall be reduced by
any income or employment Tax withholding required under (i) the Code or (ii)
any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of that Company Option. At
the REIT Effective Time, all Company Options shall be cancelled and the
Company Share Incentive Plan shall terminate. The Company shall take such
actions as are necessary to ensure that the Company Share Incentive Plan
shall terminate as of the REIT Effective Time. All administrative and other
rights and authorities granted under the Company Share Incentive Plan to the
Company, the Company Board or any committee or designee thereof, shall,
following the REIT Effective Time, reside with the Surviving Entity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise price per share or unit
provided for in any Company Option exceeds the REIT Merger Consideration per
share, no cash shall be paid with regard to such Company Option to the holder

(j) _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or as
disclosed in Section 3.1(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter and except for
routine litigation arising from the ordinary course of business of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries which is adequately covered by insurance
(subject to applicable deductibles), there is no litigation, arbitration,
claim, investigation, suit, action or proceeding pending in which service of
process or written notice, as applicable, has been received by an officer of
the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing to an
officer of the Company and against or affecting the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that could reasonably be expected to constitute a Company Material
Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, award, decree, injunction, rule or
order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Company
or any Company Subsidiary which (A) could, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, (B)
would cause any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
to be rescinded following their



 

-18- consummation, including, without limitation, the REIT Merger and OP Merger or
(C) would materially adversely affect the rights of any Purchaser Party to
own the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys assets and to operate the
Companys or any Company Subsidiarys business.



(k) _Taxes_.



(i) (A) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has timely filed all
material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any
filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to
do so or otherwise permitted by Law), (B) each such Tax Return was, at the
time filed, true, correct and complete in all material respects and (C) each
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has paid (or the Company has paid
on behalf of such Company Subsidiary), within the time and in the manner
prescribed by Law, all Taxes that are shown to be due and payable as reflected
on such Tax Returns. The most recent financial statements contained in the
Company SEC documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement
reflect adequate accrued liabilities for all material Taxes due and payable by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as a group for all taxable periods
and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as a
group) have established on their books and records reserves or accrued
liabilities or expenses that are adequate for the payment of all material
Taxes for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is liable but are not
yet due and payable. Since the date of the most recent audited
financial statements included in the Company SEC Documents, (A) the Company
has incurred no liability for any material Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c)
or 4981 of the Code or IRS Notice 88-19 or Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)-5T, including, without limitation, any material Tax arising from a
prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code and (B)
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any material
liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business. Except as
set forth in Section 3.1(k) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no deficiencies
for material Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing by a Governmental
Entity against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries which have not
been paid or remain pending, including claims by any Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax
Returns, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such material
Taxes have been granted and remain in effect or are pending.



(ii) The Company (A) for each taxable year of the Companys existence through
its taxable year ended December 31, 2003, has been subject to taxation as a
real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of the Code
and has satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (B)
has operated consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation
as a REIT for the period from December 31, 2003 through the date hereof, and
(C) has not taken any action or omitted to take any action which would
reasonably be expected to result in a successful challenge by the IRS to its
status as a REIT, and no such challenge is pending, or to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(k)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the assets owned by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries on



 

-19- the date hereof are comprised of assets described in Section 856(c)(4) of the
Code. Each Company Subsidiary which files Tax Returns as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes has since its inception or acquisition by the
Company been classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership and
not as an association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded
partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated
as a corporation for federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the
Code. Each Company Subsidiary which is a corporation has been since its
formation classified as a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of
the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds any asset (x)
the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of
the Code as announced in IRS Notice 88-19 or Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)-5t or (y) that is subject to a consent filed pursuant to Section
341(f) of the Code.



(iii) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company does not have any earnings
and profits attributable to the Company or any other corporation in any non-
REIT year within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code.



(iv) All material Taxes which the Company or the Company Subsidiaries are
required by Law to withhold in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party
and sales, gross receipts and use taxes, have been duly withheld or collected
and, to the extent required, have been paid over to the proper
Governmental Entities or are held in separate bank accounts for such purpose.
There are no Liens for material Taxes upon the assets of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries except for statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due.



(v) For periods beginning after December 31, 1997, except as set forth in
Section 3.1(k)(v) of the Company Disclosure Letter, (a) the Tax Returns of the
Company or any current Company Subsidiary have not been audited by any federal
or state income taxing authority and (b) there are no audits by and
contests with any taxing authority currently being conducted about which the
Company has been notified with regard to material Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and there are no audits pending with or
proposed by any taxing authority about which the Company has been notified
with respect to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to
any Tax allocation or sharing agreement.



(vii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(k)(vii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company does not have any material liability for the Taxes of any
Person other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and none of the

other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (A) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law), (B) as a transferee or successor or (C) by contract.



 

-20- (viii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(k)(viii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries made any
payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to an agreement
that could obligate it to make any payments that will not be deductible under
Section 280G of the Code. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
disclosed to the IRS all positions taken on their federal income Tax Returns
which could give rise to a substantial understatement of Tax under Section
6662 of the Code.



(ix) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(k)(ix) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has applied
for, received or has pending a Tax Ruling or commenced negotiations or entered
into a Closing Agreement with any taxing authority. As defined herein, "Tax
Ruling" means a written ruling of a taxing authority relating to Taxes, and
"Closing Agreement" means a written and legally binding agreement with a
taxing authority relating to Taxes.

Company Pension Plan that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of

Letter, neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate currently
sponsors, contributes to, maintains or has liability (whether contingent or

each Material Contract is valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and
effect, except where such failure to be so valid, binding and enforceable and
in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, and there are no defaults or
violations thereunder, nor does there exist any condition which upon the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a violation
of or a default thereunder, except those defaults or violations that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Contracts_ " shall mean

necessary actions to render any and all limitations on transfer or ownership

provisions of applicable federal securities laws.



 

-32- (ii) At the time the Company Proxy Statement, including any amendment or
supplement thereto filed with the SEC, is first mailed, published or given to
the holders of Common Shares, the Company Proxy Statement as supplemented or
amended, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the

Series A Preferred Units and the Series B Preferred Units) required to approve
this Agreement, the REIT Merger, the OP Merger and the other Transactions.

a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable

necessary to permit preparation of the Companys consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets;
(C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements

administrative, challenging this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated by either thereof, including seeking to have any
stay, temporary restraining order, injunction, or restraining order or other
order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents entered by any court
or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed; _provided_ , that each of

so qualified becomes untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) it
fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) such notification shall only be
required to the extent that the matter in question would prevent satisfaction

the Company), neither the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, nor the Company
and the Operating Partnership, on the other hand, will take or omit to take
any action, or permit any status to exist, prior to the Effective Time, that
would or may jeopardize, or that is inconsistent with, the Companys status as
a REIT under the Code or the status of the Operating Partnership or any
applicable Company Subsidiary as a partnership for purposes of Taxes for any
period.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company, each Company Subsidiary and any
Affiliate of any of them, shall be permitted to take or omit to take any
action, or permit any status to exist, in order to maintain the Companys
status as a REIT under the Code or the status of the Operating Partnership or
any Company Subsidiary as a partnership for purposes of Taxes for any period.



(c) The Purchaser Parties shall prepare and file, on a timely basis (or
cause to be prepared and filed on a timely basis), all federal and state
income Tax Returns and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to so
prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all other Tax Returns and
reports required to be filed from and after the Effective Time (whether such
return or report related to a time period prior to, at or after the Effective
Time) for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) in good faith and (ii)
with respect to any federal

 



 

-44- income Tax Return of the Company for the first taxable year ending on or after
the Effective Time, on a basis and in a manner that preserves the
qualification of the Company as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of
the Code.



(d) The Company shall not, nor shall the Company permit any Company Subsidiary
to, change in any material respect any of its methods of reporting income or
deductions for federal income tax purposes from those employed in the

such changes that would reduce consolidated federal taxable income or
alternative minimum taxable income.



Section 5.4. _No Solicitation of Transactions_.



(a) After the date hereof, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any
Company Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or permit any officer, director,
trustee or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor
or representative of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to (i) solicit or
initiate, encourage, or facilitate, directly or indirectly, any inquiries
relating to, or the submission of, any proposal or offer, whether in writing
or otherwise, from any person other than the Purchaser Parties or any
Affiliates thereof (a " _Third Party_ ") to acquire beneficial ownership (as
defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of all or more than 15% of the
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or the Operating
Partnership pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination,
sale of shares of beneficial interests, sale of assets, tender offer,
exchange offer or similar transaction or series of related transactions, which
is structured to permit such Third Party to acquire beneficial ownership of
more than 15% of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or the Operating Partnership (a " _Competing Transaction_ "); (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information or data with respect to or access to the properties of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to, or take any other
action to knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction; or (iii)
enter into any agreement (written or oral) with respect to any Competing
Transaction, approve or recommend or resolve to approve or recommend any
Competing Transaction or enter into any agreement (written or oral) requiring
it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the REIT Merger, the OP Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
(A) the Company and the Operating Partnership may take such actions reasonably
necessary or otherwise appropriate in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Industrial Sale Agreement and/or the
Commercial Properties Sale and (B) the Company may participate in ordinary
course investor relations discussions relating to ordinary course transactions
in the Companys equity securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
prior to the Effective Time, if the Company receives an unsolicited bona
fide, written proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction by a Third Party,
which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consulting the Company
Boards independent financial advisor and independent legal counsel) (A) is
on terms which are more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Common Shares than the REIT Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (B) is not subject to any
material contingency, including any contingency relating to



 

-45- financing, to which neither (1) the Company Board determines may likely be
overcome or addressed nor (2) the other party thereto has reasonably
demonstrated in its written offer its ability to overcome or address,
including the receipt of government consents or approvals (including any such
approval required under the HSR Act), and (C) is reasonably capable of
being consummated ( _provided_ , that the Company, including the Company
Board, and any of its advisors shall be permitted to contact such Third Party
and its advisors and financing sources solely for the purpose of clarifying
the proposal and any material contingencies and the capability of
consummation) (a " _Superior Competing Transaction_ "), then the Company may,
in response to an unsolicited request therefor and subject to compliance with
_Section 5.4(b)_ , furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to, and participate in discussions and negotiations
directly or through its representatives with, such Third Party, subject to a
confidentiality agreement not less favorable to the Company than the
confidentiality and standstill agreements referred to in _Section 5.1_.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or from making any other disclosure required by applicable Law.



(b) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries will cease and cause to
be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted or commenced heretofore with respect to, or that could be expected
to lead to, a Superior Competing Transaction and will cause each of their
respective trustees, directors, officers, employees, advisors, consultants and
agents to comply with such obligations.



(c) The Company shall advise the Purchaser Parties orally and in writing of
(i) any Competing Transaction or any inquiry with respect to or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Transaction received by any
officer or trustee of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
employee, financial advisor, attorney or other advisor or representative of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) the material terms of such
Competing Transaction (including a copy of any written proposal) and (iii) the
identity of the person making the proposal or offer for any such
Competing Transaction or inquiry promptly following receipt by the Company or
any officer or trustee of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
employee, financial advisor, attorney or other advisor or representative of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary of such Competing Transaction proposal
or inquiry. The Company will keep the Purchaser Parties informed of the status
and details of any such Competing Transaction proposal or inquiry in a timely
manner. None of the Purchaser Parties or their respective affiliates or
advisors shall contact any Person regarding such Competing Transaction or
otherwise interfere with such Competing Transaction.



Section 5.5. _Public Announcements_. The Company and the Purchaser Parties
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent
of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent
of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as
may be required by Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange if it
has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party
and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so in a timely
manner. In this regard, the parties shall make a joint public announcement of
the



 

-46- transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents no later than (i)
promptly after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the day
this Agreement is signed, if such signing occurs during regular business hours
on a Business Day or (ii) prior to the opening of trading on the New York
Stock Exchange on the Business Day following the date on which this Agreement
is signed, if such signing does not occur during a Business Day.



Section 5.6. _Transfer and Gains Taxes; Shareholder Demand Letters_. The
Purchaser Parties shall, with the Companys good faith cooperation and
assistance, prepare, execute and file, or cause to be prepared, executed and
filed, all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding
any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added stock
transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other
fees and any similar taxes which become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together, with any related
interests, penalties or additions to tax, " _Transfer and Gains Taxes_ ").
From and after the Effective Time, the Purchaser Parties shall cause the
Operating Partnership to pay or cause to be paid all Transfer and Gains Taxes.



Section 5.7. _Employee Arrangements; Accrued Bonuses; Employee Brokerage
Arrangements_.



(a) _Company Severance Agreements_. On the Closing Date, the
Operating Partnership shall pay or cause to be paid (and the Purchaser
Parties agree and acknowledge that Company shall pay or cause to be paid) the
amounts due to certain of the Companys or the Operating Partnerships
executive officers and other employees under such executive officers and
other employees Company Severance Agreements, as set forth in Section 5.7(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter and in accordance with such Company Severance
Agreements (the " _Designated Severance_ "); _provided_ , that the aggregate
amount to be paid pursuant to this sentence shall not exceed Three Million
Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,700,000), plus any other amounts permitted
below (the " _Severance Cap_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Company
or the Operating Partnership incurs any obligations under any Company
Severance Agreement between the date hereof and the Effective Time for such
specified executive officers and other employees (other than as set forth in
the last proviso of this sentence), the Severance Cap shall be reduced by a
corresponding amount; _provided_ , _further_ , to the extent that persons
employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than the executive
officers and employees identified in Section 5.7(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter are terminated at the request of the Purchaser Parties after the date
hereof, the Company or the Operating Partnership shall pay all amounts due
under any Company Severance Agreement applicable to such persons and such
amounts shall be in addition to the Severance Cap. In addition, and also on
the earlier of the Closing Date or January 2005, the Company shall pay or
cause to be paid (and the Purchaser Parties agree and acknowledge that
Company shall pay or cause to be paid) to each employee, the annual bonus
amount earned by such employee as of the Closing Date pursuant to the MBO Plan
and/or the Companys normal appraisal review process (the " _Annual Bonuses_
") and subject to the parameters set forth in Section 5.7(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , that the aggregate amount of such bonuses
shall not exceed One Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,400,000) (the
" _Bonus Cap_ "), subject to reduction as provided in the following sentence;
_provided_ , _further_ , that bonuses for property level employees which have
been accrued in the ordinary course of business in the budget for the
applicable property and which are to be paid in the ordinary course of
business shall be in addition to the Bonus Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent the Annual Bonuses are less than the Bonus Cap, such savings,
in an amount not to exceed $250,000, shall be added to the Severance Cap and
deducted from the Bonus Cap.



 

-47- (b) _Benefit Plans_.



(i) Upon and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity (or its successors or assigns) to continue in effect the Company
Employee Benefit Plans and provide benefits to the employees of the Company
that are substantially similar in all material respects, on an aggregate
basis, to the Company Employee Benefit Plans in which such employees
participated prior to the Effective Time for a period of not less than one
year. As of the Effective Time, a trustee and an administrator of Company
Employee Benefit Plans will be designated by the Purchaser Parties. With
respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan which is an "employee benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and any other service based benefits
(including vacations) in which the employees of the Company may participate at
any time after the Effective Time, solely for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits but not for
purposes of accrual of benefits (except in the case of accrued vacation, sick
or personal time), service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall
be treated as service with each of the Purchaser Parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits under both a Company
Employee Benefit Plan and a benefit plan of any Purchaser Party (or is not
otherwise recognized for such purposes under the benefit plans of Purchaser
Party). Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser Parties shall not treat
any Company employee as a "new" employee for purposes of any pre-existing
condition exclusions, waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements
or similar provision under any health or other welfare plan, and will
make appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s), to the extent
applicable, to ensure such result.



(ii) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Company or the Purchaser Parties
shall, or shall cause the Company or the Surviving Entity, to take all
necessary actions to fully vest the account balances and benefits of all
individuals who are employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary on the
Closing Date under any Company Pension Plan in which such employees
participate. With respect to any employees of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary whose employment is terminated on or after the Closing Date and not
employed by the Surviving Entity (the " _Terminated Employees_ "), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Suriving Entity to, (i) distribute or cause to be
distributed to such Terminated Employees such notices and forms that are

Terminated Employees may elect to receive a distribution of their benefits
under any Company Pension Plan in which such Terminated Employees participate
or rollover such benefits to an "eligible retirement plan," as defined in
Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Code and shall promptly cooperate with such
Terminated Employees in effecting the foregoing and (ii) be responsible for
all liabilities and obligations in connection with the continuation coverage
requirements, including notice requirements, of Section 4980B of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of

to pay, for the period set forth opposite such Terminated Employees name in
Section 4.7(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the full cost of any

purpose, to repay such loan in accordance with the terms thereof.



(d) _Company Options_. The Company and each Company Subsidiary shall take such
actions as are necessary under the Company Share Incentive Plan to effect the
cancellations described in _Section 2.3_ and shall comply with all

Parent that no holder of Company Options or other awards under such plan or
participant in the Company Share Incentive Plan, will have any right to
acquire any interest in the Purchaser Parties or any Affiliate or Subsidiary
of Parent as a result of the exercise of Company Options or other awards or
rights pursuant to the Company Share Incentive Plan at or after the Effective
Time.



(e) _Employee Brokerage Arrangements_. The Company and the Purchaser Parties
agree that after the Effective Time if any of the tenants listed in Section
5.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter as of the date of this Agreement or in
updated Section 5.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter delivered to the
Purchaser Parties on the Closing Date shall execute a lease with the Surviving
Entity or any subsidiary thereof within 150 days of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall pay, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to
pay, the individual whose name is opposite such tenant in Section 5.7(e) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, regardless if such individual remains an
employee of the Surviving Entity or any subsidiary thereof, a brokerage
commission in the amount set forth in Section 5.7(e) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. In the event that any Company Property is sold to any other Person or
entity after the Effective Time and before the expiration of such 150-day
period or pursuant to the Commercial Properties Sale, the Company and the
Purchaser Parties shall make proper provision so that such Person or
entity assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7(e)_.



(f) _Employees_. The Purchaser Parties shall be responsible for compliance
with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the "
_Federal WARN Act_ ") and the Illinois Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act (together with the Federal WARN Act, the " _WARN
Acts_ ") with respect to terminations occurring at or after the Effective Time
at the request or direction of the Purchaser Parties. The Company shall
refrain from causing an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Acts) in
the 90 days prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that any such
"employment loss" resulting from actions taken by the



 

-49- Company with the consent or at the request of the Purchaser Parties shall not
constitute a breach of this covenant;  _provided_ , _further_ , that such
consent shall be deemed to be given if the Purchaser Parties do not object in
writing within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the written notice from
the Company of its intention to take such action. The Company shall cooperate
with and provide reasonable assistance to the Purchaser Parties in delivering
any notices required or potentially required pursuant to any Company Severance
Agreement or the WARN Acts to effectuate the termination of Company employees
as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all such notices shall
indicate that the terminations shall be contingent upon the consummation of
the REIT Merger.



(g) In the event the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity after the
Effective Time and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its
properties and assets to any person or entity after the Effective Time, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors,
assigns and transferees of the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7._



Section 5.8. _Indemnification; Trustees  and Officers Insurance_.



(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Closing, a
trustee, director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to
be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a trustee, director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as a trustee, director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or
(ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising
before or after the Closing, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond thereto.
It is understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless, and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity to, and the Surviving Entity shall, indemnify and hold harmless, as
and to the full extent permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified Party
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation
(whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time), (A) the
Company, and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity
to, and the Surviving Entity shall, promptly pay expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law, subject to the
provision by such Indemnified Party of an undertaking to reimburse the amounts
so advanced in the event of a final non-appealable determination by a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to such
amounts, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain one counsel reasonably
satisfactory to



 

-50- them and the Company (except in the case of a potential conflict of interest
among two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case more than one counsel
may be retained), and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, and the Surviving Entity shall, pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties within 30 days after
statements therefor are received and (C) the Company and the Surviving Entity
will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter; _provided_
, that neither the Company nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and _provided_ _further_ , neither the
Surviving Entity nor Company shall have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if, but only to the extent that, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and non-appealable, that indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this _Section 5.8_ , upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity thereof; _provided_ , that the failure to
so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company and the Surviving
Entity except and only to the extent such failure to notify materially
prejudices such party. The obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.8(a)_ are
in addition to, and shall in no way affect or limit, the rights to
indemnification granted pursuant to the Company Charter and the Company By-
laws.



(b) The Purchaser Parties agree that all rights to indemnification existing in
favor of, and all exculpations and limitations of the personal liability of,
the trustees, directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries provided for in the Company Charter or the Company
By-laws as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the OP Merger and the REIT
Merger, shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than
six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claims (each, a " _Claim_ ") asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Claim. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and pay
for, at the Companys expense, a fully paid policy or policies of directors
and officers liability insurance (including side A coverage) providing
tail coverage for the Persons currently covered by the Companys existing
policies for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time, and providing at least the same coverage and amounts as,
and containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to the
covered Persons in any material respect than, the Companys current policies.



(c) This _Section 5.8_  is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Purchaser Parties. Each of the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this _Section
5.8_ , each of which such covenants shall survive the Closing Date.



(d) In the event that the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity after
the REIT Effective Time and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its
properties and assets to any person or entity after the REIT Effective



 

-51- Time, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors, assigns and transferees of the Surviving Entity, as the case may
be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.



(e) To the extent permitted by law, all rights of indemnification for the
benefit of any Indemnified Party shall be mandatory rather than permissive.

Operating Partnership shall cooperate, at the Purchaser Parties request, and
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, approvals,
waivers, exemptions and tenant estoppel certificates as are necessary to
complete the Commercial Properties Sale; _provided_ , _however_ , that the

Properties Sale shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company and subject
only to satisfaction or permissible waiver of all the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ hereof and to customary conditions for similar real estate sale
transactions and all actions taken by the Company or any Company Subsidiary

Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall (i) the successful results of such cooperation
by the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Company Subsidiary (including
but not limited to the receipt of any certain number of satisfactory

the receipt thereof in specific forms) or (ii) the successful completion of
the Commercial Properties Sale, be in any manner whatsoever a condition to

supplement to the Company Proxy Statement, the Company shall, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this _Section 5.12_ , prepare and file with
the SEC such amendment or supplement as soon thereafter as is reasonably

shall cooperate, and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Companys attorneys, accountants and other representatives to cooperate, in
connection with any financing efforts (including, without limitation, the

the Purchaser Parties (including providing assistance in the Purchaser
Parties preparation of one or more offering circulars, private placement
memoranda, registration statements or other offering documents relating to

Subsidiaries (including but not limited to the receipt of a certain number of
satisfactory consents, approvals, waivers, exemptions or tenant estoppels or
the receipt of such consents, approvals, waivers, exemptions or tenant
estoppels in specific forms), (ii) the failure by the Purchaser Parties to
enter into acceptable fee agreements with the Companys attorneys or
accountants or (iii) the successful completion of such financing efforts
(including, without limitation, the refinancing or assumption of existing
indebtedness or the sale of assets), be in any manner whatsoever a condition

by this Agreement.

the Purchaser Parties sole expense, of financing statements identifying
Liens on the Company Properties required by the Purchaser Parties financing

) inform the holders of Common Shares that it no longer believes that the REIT
Merger (a " _Subsequent Determination_ ") is advisable and no longer
recommends approval of the REIT Merger, but only if (A) the Company Board
receives a Superior Competing Transaction which is not subsequently withdrawn
or (B) the Company Board determines in good faith and on a reasonable basis,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the trustees of the Company
under applicable Law.



(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.17_ shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to holders of Company Shares a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a)

with respect to the annual information only, a report on the annual financial

addition, after the Effective Time and for so long as any Series B Shares
remain outstanding, the Purchaser Parties agree to cause the Surviving Entity
to furnish to the holders of the Series B Shares and to securities analysts
and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be
available pursuant to Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act to the extent such
information is not electronically filed with the SEC and electronically
available to the public free of cost.



(b) The Purchaser Parties covenant and agree that, after the Effective Time
and so long as the Series B Shares are issued and outstanding, the Purchaser
Parties will not propose, and the Purchaser Parties and their respective
Affiliates will not vote or cause to be voted any Common Shares with respect
to which they are entitled to vote against, any action which would impair the
Surviving Entitys status as a REIT for purposes of the Code, unless a
majority of the then Independent Trustees of the Surviving Entity has
determined that it would be in the best interests of the Surviving Entity and
its shareholders that the Surviving Entity no longer maintain its status as a
REIT under the Code.



Section 5.19. _Environmental Matters_. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall make available to the Purchaser Parties such

together with the payment of One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars



 

-56- ($1,250,000) made on September 23, 2004 by PGI to the Operating Partnership,
shall constitute full satisfaction of PGIs obligations under that certain
Environmental Remediation and Indemnification Agreement dated as of November
17, 1997 by and between the Operating Partnership and PGI, as amended. Such
satisfaction shall be evidenced by a release between PGI and the Operating

Continental Towers project located in Rolling Meadows, Illinois ("
_Continental Towers_ "), that the Company intends to refinance the mortgage
loan encumbering Continental Towers (the " _CT Refinancing_ ") upon the early

structure and negotiate a proposed loan arrangement to accomplish the CT
Refinancing with a financing source or sources with the goal of the Company or
an appropriate Company Subsidiary entering into a loan commitment for the CT
Refinancing mutually satisfactory to the Company and the Purchaser
Parties. If the Company does not enter into a loan commitment for the CT

contrary contained in this Agreement, including _Section 4.1(b)_ , the Company
may, without the consent of any Purchaser Party, enter into a loan commitment
and pay a loan commitment fee for the CT Refinancing acceptable to the
Company; _provided_ , that (i) the terms of the loan commitment shall provide
for a loan (A) with a variable interest rate (which may be subject to an

to exceed the principal amount being refinanced, (C) that has a term of no
less than two (2) years or more than five (5) years, (D) which shall not

qualification) shall be true and correct, as of the Effective Time, as if such
representations and warranties were made at the Effective Time (except to the
extent that any such representation or warranty, by its terms, is expressly
limited to a specific date, in which case such representation or warranty
shall be true and correct as of such date), except where the failure to be so
true and correct would not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The Company and the Operating Partnership shall have performed or complied
with in all material respects each of its agreements and covenants contained
in this Agreement required to be performed or complied with by it at or prior
to the Effective Time.



(c) Since the date of this Agreement there shall not have occurred any event,
occurrence or condition that would constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

Partnership and all Company Subsidiaries (which are organized as partnerships
or limited liability companies or which file tax returns as partnerships) as
partnerships and not as associations taxable as corporations or publicly-
traded partnerships for federal income tax purposes since the acquisition or
formation of Company Subsidiaries by the Company and the parties to the
Financing shall be entitled to rely on such opinion.

warranty shall be true and correct as of such date).

Parties nor the Company or the Operating Partnership may rely on the

with _Section 5.4_ ); or (ii) the Company Board shall have (A) recommended
to the Company shareholders that they approve a Competing Transaction rather

obligation under this Agreement has been the proximate cause of the failure
of the REIT Merger to be consummated on or prior to such date);



(f) by written notice by Parent or the Company, if the Company Shareholder
Approval shall not have been obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting or
at any adjournment or postponement thereof;



(g) by written notice by Parent, upon a breach of any representation,
warranty, agreement or covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement (in

of their respective representations, warranties, agreements or covenants
contained in this Agreement) such that the conditions set forth in _Section
6.2(a)_ or _(b)_ , as the case may be, cannot be satisfied (any such breach, a
" _Terminating Company Breach_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
Terminating Company Breach is capable of being cured by the Company within
twenty (20) days after Parent notifies the Company of the



 

-60- occurrence of the Terminating Company Breach through the exercise of its
commercially reasonable efforts and is so cured within such period, so long
as the Company continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts,
Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(g)_ ;



(h) by written notice by the Company, upon a breach of any representation,
warranty, agreement or covenant of the Purchaser Parties contained in this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.3(a)_ or _(b)_ ,
as the case may be, cannot be satisfied (any such event or condition, a "
_Terminating Purchaser Party Breach_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
if such Terminating Purchaser Party Breach (other than a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.2(c)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ )
is capable of being cured by the Purchaser Parties within twenty (20) days or
(ii) if such Terminating Purchaser Party Breach resulting from a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.2(c)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ is
capable of being cured by the Purchaser Parties within five (5) days, in each
case, after the Company notifies Parent of the Terminating Purchaser Party
Breach through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts and is so
cured within such period, so long as the Purchaser Parties continue to
exercise such commercially reasonable efforts, the Company may not terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(h)_ ; or



(i) automatically, without any action or notice by the Company or any other
Person, upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the
Purchaser Parties fail to make the Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollar

Chicago time, on November 9, 2004.



The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1_  shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless

controlling or controlled by any such party or any of their respective
officers, directors, trustees, employees, agents or representatives, whether
prior to or after the execution of this Agreement.



Section 7.2. _Expenses; Break-up Fee; Earnest Money_.



(a) Except as otherwise specified in this _Section 7.2_ or agreed in writing
by the parties, all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement, the OP Merger, the REIT Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
cost or expense (with respect to such party, its " _Expenses_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if applicable, any filing fees under the HSR Act shall be
split equally between the Company and Parent. The Company agrees that if (i)
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ or (ii) if (A) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(f) and (B) (I) separate
voting agreements with and for the benefit of the Purchaser Parties had not
been entered into by Vornado Realty Trust (or its applicable Affiliates) ("
_Vornado_ ") and by Cadim, inc. (or its applicable Affiliates) (" _Cadim_
" and together with Vornado, the " _Significant Shareholders_ ") prior to the

REIT Merger or (II) such voting agreements had not been entered into and all
of the Common Shares beneficially owned by each of the Significant
Shareholders were not voted to approve this Agreement and the REIT Merger at
the Company Shareholders Meeting, then, subject to the limitation set forth
in the proviso to the first sentence of _Section 7.2(b)_ , the Company shall
pay to Parent an amount equal to the actual out-of-pocket expenses of Parent
or its affiliates incurred in connection with this Agreement and the



 

-61- transactions contemplated hereby (including all attorneys, accountants and
financing sources fees and expenses) but in no event in an amount greater
than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (the " _Parent Expenses_ "). Any
payment of the Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be
made, as directed by Parent, by prompt wire transfer of immediately available
funds, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the amount is
due as provided herein; _provided_ , that in any such event of the required
payment of the Parent Expenses, Parent shall provide the Company with
customary documentation or other reasonable support evidencing the incurrence
of the Parent Expenses.



(b) The Company agrees that (i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)_ , _(d)_ or _(g)_ (but only in the event of a Terminating
Company Breach that was the result of a knowing and willful determination or
decision by the Company Board or the Companys senior executive management to
cause such breach of this Agreement) or (ii) if (A) this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(f), (B) within three hundred sixty-five
(365) days thereafter, the Company enters into an agreement to consummate a
Superior Competing Transaction which is subsequently consummated, and (C) (I)
the Significant Shareholders had not each entered into separate voting
agreements with and for the benefit of the Purchaser Parties prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting pursuant to which such Significant Shareholder
agreed to vote its respective Common Shares to approve this Agreement and the
REIT Merger or (II) no such voting agreements had been entered into and all of
the Common Shares beneficially owned by each of the Significant Shareholders
were not voted to approve this Agreement and the REIT Merger at the Company
Shareholders Meeting, then, the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to
Seven Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,800,000) (the " _Break-Up
Fee_ "); _provided_ , that, with respect to any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ in circumstances where the Break-Up Fee is
payable in accordance with this _Section 7.2(b)_ , in no event shall the
Company also be obligated to pay the Parent Expenses, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement; provided, further, that
with respect to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f)
in circumstances where the Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance with
this Section 7.2(b), the amount of such Break-Up Fee due and payable shall be
reduced by the amount of Parent Expenses previously and irrevocably paid by
the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(a). Any payment of such amount shall be
made, as directed by Parent, by prompt wire transfer of immediately available
funds, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the amount is
due as provided herein.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ , _(d)_ , ( _f_ ) or _(g)_ in
circumstances where the Parent Expenses or the Break-Up Fee, as applicable,
are payable in accordance with _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ ,
respectively, the payment of the Parent Expenses or the Break-Up Fee, as
applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for
damages or any other claim which the Purchaser Parties would otherwise be
entitled to assert against the Company, the Operating Partnership or any
other Company Subsidiary or any of their respective assets, or against any of
their respective trustees, directors, officers, employees, partners,
shareholders or stockholders, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall constitute
the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Purchaser Parties. The parties
hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of
accurately determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing upon any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ , _(d)_ , ( _f)_ or
_(g)_ in circumstances where the Parent Expenses or the Break-Up Fee, as
applicable, are payable in accordance with _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section
7.2(b)_ , respectively, the amount of the Parent Expenses or the Break-Up Fee,
as applicable: (i) constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages that will
be suffered by reason of any such proposed or actual termination of this
Agreement pursuant to said section, and (ii) shall be in full and complete
satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing.
Except for nonpayment of the amounts set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 7.2(b)_ , the Purchaser Parties hereby agree that, upon any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ , _(d)_ , ( _f_ )
or _(g)_ in circumstances where the Parent Expenses or the Break-Up Fee, as
applicable, are payable in accordance with _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section
7.2(b)_ , respectively, in no event shall any of the Purchaser Parties (A)
seek to obtain any recovery or judgment against the Company, the Operating
Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary or any of their respective assets,
or



 

-62- against any of their respective trustees, directors, officers, employees,
partners, shareholders or stockholders with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, or (B) be entitled to
seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including, without limitation,
consequential, indirect or punitive damages with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.



(d) Each of the Purchaser Parties agrees that if this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ , then the Company shall be entitled
to retain the Earnest Money. In addition, each of the Purchaser Parties agree
that if this Agreement terminates automatically pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ ,
then the Company shall be entitled to retain the Initial Deposit Funds.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ or _(i)_ in
circumstances where the Company is entitled to retain the Earnest Money or the
Initial Deposit Funds in accordance with this _Section 7.2(d)_ , the Earnest
Money or the Initial Deposit Funds, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated
damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which the
Company would otherwise be entitled to assert against any of the Purchaser
Parties or any of their respective assets, or against any of their respective
trustees, directors, managers, officers, employees, partners, shareholders,
stockholders or members, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy available to the Company. The parties hereto expressly
acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately
determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing upon any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ or _(i)_ in circumstances where
the Company is entitled to retain the Earnest Money or the Initial Deposit
Funds in accordance with this _Section 7.2(d)_ , the amount of the Earnest
Money or the Initial Deposit Funds, as applicable: (i) constitutes a
reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by reason of any such
proposed or actual termination of this Agreement pursuant to said section,
and (ii) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages
arising as a result of the foregoing. Except for nonpayment of the applicable
amount set forth in this _Section 7.2(d)_ , the Company hereby agrees that,
upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ or _(i)_
in circumstances where the Company is entitled to retain the Earnest Money or
the Initial Deposit Funds in accordance with this _Section 7.2(d)_ , in no
event shall the Company (A) seek to obtain any recovery or judgment against
any of the Purchaser Parties or any of their respective assets, or against any
of their respective trustees, directors, managers, officers,
employees, partners, shareholders or stockholders with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, or
(B) be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including,
without limitation, consequential, indirect or punitive damages with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than a
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ or _(i)_ in circumstances where the
Earnest Money or the Initial Deposit Funds is payable to the Company in
accordance with this _Section 7.2(d)_ , then the Earnest Money or the Initial
Deposit Funds, as applicable, shall be refunded to the Purchaser Parties.



Section 7.3. _Notice of Termination_. The party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with _Section 8.2_ , specifying
the provision or provisions of _Section 7.1_ (describing in reasonable detail
the basis therefor) pursuant to which such termination is effected.



 

-63- Section 7.4. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_ , this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto or their respective
affiliates, trustees, directors, managers, officers, shareholders,
stockholders or members (including, without limitation, in connection with a
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ , the obligation pursuant to _Section
5.20_ ), except that the last sentence of _Section 5.1_ ,  _Section 7.1_ ,
_Section 7.2_ , this _Section 7.4_ and _Article VIII_ shall survive such
termination and except to the extent that such termination results from a
willful breach by a party of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement.



Section 7.5. _Return of Earnest Money_. The parties agree that if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , the parties shall instruct

_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ , the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
transfer the Deposit to Company with interest within two (2) Business Days of
termination by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Company.



Section 7.6. _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties in writing by action of their
respective boards of trustees, managers or directors or members, as
applicable, at any time before or after the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained but, after the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, no
amendment shall be made which decreases the REIT Merger Consideration or which
adversely affects the rights of the holders of the Common Shares without the
approval of such holders.



Section 7.7. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and the Purchaser Parties may (a) extend the time for the

party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (c) subject to the provisions of _Section 7.6_ , waive (as
permitted by applicable Law) compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions of the other party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on
the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.
