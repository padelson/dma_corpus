") and (ii) the Closing Indebtedness (the " _Buyer Closing Statements_ ").

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Sellers Representative of
the Buyer Closing Statements, the Sellers Representative shall notify Buyer
as to whether Sellers agree or disagree with any components of the Buyer
Closing Statements and, if Sellers disagree, such notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, including calculation
by Sellers of the Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount or the Closing
Indebtedness (" _Closing Statements Notice of Disagreement_ "). If the
Sellers Representative provides a notice pursuant to which it agrees
with each of the components of the Buyer Closing Statements or does not
provide a Closing Statements Notice of Disagreement within such thirty (30)
day period, then Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted the calculations and
the amounts set forth in the Buyer Closing Statements delivered by Buyer,
which shall then be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder.
If any such Closing Statements Notice of Disagreement is timely provided, then
Sellers Representative and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
for a period of thirty (30) days thereafter to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the calculations or amounts identified in the Closing Statements
Notice of Disagreement. Any item or amount to which no dispute is raised in
the Closing Statements Notice of Disagreement will be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. In connection with the review by the Sellers
Representative of the Buyer Closing Statements, Buyer shall provide to the
Sellers Representative full, reasonable access to the records, employees and
accountants of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and the U.K.
Affiliate) and shall cause the employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and the U.K. Affiliate) to cooperate in all reasonable
respects with the Sellers Representative in connection with his or her

 



5  review of such work papers and other documents and information relating to
the calculation of the Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount or the Closing
Indebtedness, as applicable, as the Sellers Representative may reasonably
request and that are available to Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the
Company and the U.K. Affiliate) or their accountants.

(c) If, at the end of the thirty (30) day resolution period, Buyer and the
Sellers Representative are unable to resolve any disagreements as to items in
the Closing Statements Notice of Disagreement, then PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (or such other independent accounting firm of recognized national standing
as may be mutually selected by the Sellers Representative and Buyer) shall be
appointed, as an expert and not an arbitrator, to resolve any remaining
disagreements, but in no case shall such independent accounting firm review or
propose any resolution for any matters that have not been raised in the
Closing Statements Notice of Disagreement. If PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is
unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity and Buyer and the Sellers
Representative are not able to mutually select an alternative accounting firm
that is willing and able to serve in such capacity, then Sellers shall within
ten (10) days deliver to Buyer a listing of three (3) other accounting firms
of recognized national standing and Buyer shall within ten (10) days after
receipt of such list, select one of such three (3) accounting firms;
_provided_ that the firm so selected shall not have performed accounting, tax
or audit services for the Company, any Seller, Buyer or Affiliate of any of
the foregoing for a period of three (3) years prior to its selection (such
firm as is ultimately selected pursuant to the aforementioned procedures being
the " _Accountant_ "). The Accountant shall be charged with determining as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the
date on which such dispute is referred to the Accountant, any unresolved
disputed items required to determine the Final Working Capital Adjustment
Amount or the Closing Indebtedness and, upon reaching such
determination, shall deliver a copy of its calculations to the Sellers
Representative and Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in
no event shall the Accountants determination result in a Final Working
Capital Adjustment Amount or Closing Indebtedness outside of the range
established by Buyers calculation of the Final Working Capital Adjustment
Amount or Closing Indebtedness, as applicable, delivered in the Buyer Closing
Statements pursuant to  _Section 2.04(a)_ and Sellers calculation of the
Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount or Closing Indebtedness, as
applicable, delivered in the Closing Statements Notice of Disagreement
pursuant to _Section 2.04(b)_. The determination of the Accountant shall be
final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. Such amounts as
finally determined by the Accountant shall be used to determine the Final
Working Capital Adjustment Amount and the Closing Indebtedness. Each Party
shall bear its own attorneys fees, costs and expenses relating to such
dispute and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses invoiced by the Accountant
relating to such dispute shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Sellers and
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

(d) Within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the last disputed item
required to determine the Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount or the
Closing Indebtedness, as applicable, is resolved pursuant to _Section
2.04(b)_ and _(c)_ , (i) if the Final Cash Consideration exceeds the Initial
Cash Consideration, Buyer shall pay in cash to Sellers identified as owners
of the U.S. Shares on _Exhibit A_, in the proportions set forth on _Exhibit
A_ , the amount by which the Final Cash Consideration exceeds the Initial
Cash Consideration, and Buyer and Sellers Representative, by joint
instruction, shall instruct (which instruction shall be based solely upon the
calculation of the Final Cash Consideration using the Final Working 

 



6  Capital Adjustment Amount and the Closing Indebtedness, each as finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 2.04_) the Escrow Agent to
release all of the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Amount (and any interest
earned thereon) to Sellers pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, or (ii) if the
Initial Cash Consideration exceeds the Final Cash Consideration, Sellers shall
pay to Buyer the amount by which the Initial Cash Consideration exceeds the
Final Cash Consideration, (A) which amount shall be satisfied first from the
Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Amount (and any interest earned thereon)
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and, if such amount exceeds the Working
Capital Adjustment Escrow Amount (and any interest earned thereon), directly
from Sellers identified as owners of the U.S. Shares on _Exhibit A_, in the
proportions set forth on _Exhibit A_ (but such obligations of payment shall
be joint and several among them), or (B) if such amount is _less_ than the
Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Amount, Buyer and Sellers Representative,
by joint instruction, shall instruct (which instruction shall be based solely
upon the calculation of the Final Cash Consideration using the Final Working
Capital Adjustment Amount and the Closing Indebtedness, each as finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 2.04_) the Escrow Agent to
release such difference (and any interest earned thereon) to Sellers and the
remaining amount of the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Amount (and any
interest earned thereon) to Buyer pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 2.05. _Withholding_. __ Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any payments made pursuant to this Agreement any amounts required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code or other applicable Laws, and shall
timely remit any such withheld amounts to the appropriate Governmental
Authority as required by applicable Laws. Any amounts deducted and withheld
pursuant to this _Section 2.05_ shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable payee.

Section 2.06. _Earn-Out Payment_.

(a) At the end of the Earn-Out Period, if Revenue for the Earn-Out Period
(the " _Earn-Out Period Revenue_ ") exceeds Two Hundred And Sixteen Million
Dollars ($216,000,000), Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Sellers in
accordance with this  _Section 2.06_ cash in an amount equal to the product
of (i) 1.09375 times (ii) the difference of the Earn-Out Period Revenue minus
Two Hundred And Sixteen Million Dollars ($216,000,000), up to a maximum total
payment of Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000) (the " _Earn-Out
Payment_ "). In the event that Earn-Out Period Revenue is less than or equal
to Two Hundred And Sixteen Million Dollars ($216,000,000), the Earn-Out
Payment shall be zero and Buyer shall have no further obligation with respect
to the Earn-Out Payment.

(b) During the Earn-Out Period, within thirty (30) days following the end of
each fiscal quarter, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers
Representative a statement setting forth in reasonable detail Buyers
computation of Revenue for such fiscal quarter.

 

(c) On or before Friday, December 28, 2012, Buyer shall (i) prepare and
deliver to the Sellers Representative a statement (the " _Earn-Out
Statement_ "), which shall set forth in reasonable detail (A) Buyers
computation of the Earn-Out Period Revenue, (B) all reasonably requested
relevant backup materials used to prepare the Earn-Out Statement and (C) the
amount of the Earn-Out Payment owed by Buyer to Sellers, if any, and (ii) pay
such Earn-Out Payment, if any, in cash to Sellers identified as owners of the
U.S. Shares on _Exhibit A_ , in the proportions set forth on _Exhibit A_.

 



7 (d) Within twenty (20) days after delivery of the Earn-Out Statement,
the Sellers Representative shall notify Buyer in writing as to whether
Sellers agree or disagree with the calculation of Revenue set forth in the
Earn-Out Statement and, if Sellers disagree, such notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement (the " _Earn-Out
Notice of Disagreement_ "). If the Sellers Representative provides a notice
pursuant to which Sellers agree with the calculations of Revenue or does not
provide an Earn-Out Notice of Disagreement within such twenty (20) day
period, then Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted the calculations set
forth in the Earn-Out Statement delivered by Buyer, which shall then be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If any such Earn-Out
Notice of Disagreement is timely provided, then Sellers Representative and
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30)
days thereafter to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculations
identified in the Earn-Out Notice of Disagreement. In connection with the
review by Sellers Representative of the Earn-Out Statement, Buyer shall
provide to the Sellers Representative full, reasonable access to the
records, employees and accountants of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including
the Company) and shall cause the employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company) to cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Sellers Representative in connection with his or her review of such work
papers and other documents and information relating to the calculation of the
Revenue as the Sellers Representative may reasonably request and that are
available to Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company) or their
accountants.

(e) If, at the end of the thirty (30) day resolution period, Buyer and
Sellers Representative are unable to resolve any disagreements as to items in
the Earn-Out Notice of Disagreement, then the Accountant shall be appointed,
as an expert and not an arbitrator, to resolve any remaining disagreements
and each of the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall provide a written
notice to the Accountant setting forth its final determination of the disputed
portion of the Earn-Out Payment due to Sellers, if any (each, an " _Earn-Out
Dispute Amount_ "). The Accountant shall be charged with determining as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the
date on which such dispute is referred to the Accountant, any unresolved
disputed items, and upon reaching such determination shall deliver a copy of
its calculations to the Sellers Representative and Buyer. The determination
of the Accountant as to the disputed items shall be final and binding upon
Buyer and Sellers; _provided_ that in no event shall the amount determined by
the Accountant be more than Sellers Earn-Out Dispute Amount or less than
Buyers Earn-Out Dispute Amount. Each Party shall bear its own attorneys
fees, costs and expenses relating to such dispute and all reasonable fees,
costs and expenses invoiced by the Accountant relating to such dispute shall
be paid fifty percent (50%) by Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

 

(f) Within five (5) Business Days of the date on which any final determination
of Revenue pursuant to _Sections 2.06(d)_ and  _2.06(e)_ , if an Earn-Out
Payment is owed to Sellers, Buyer shall pay such Earn-Out Payment in cash to
Sellers identified as owners of the U.S. Shares on _Exhibit A_, in the
proportions set forth on _Exhibit A_.

 



8 (g) Within five (5) Business Days of a Change of Control that is consummated
during the Earn-Out Period, Buyer shall pay the maximum Earn-Out Payment of
Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000) in cash to Sellers identified as
owners of the U.S. Shares on _Exhibit A_, in the proportions set forth on

suppliers and vendors, sales and marketing and pricing and product branding.

Section 2.07. _Section 338(h)(10) Election; Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Sellers, the Company and Buyer shall jointly make a timely election
provided for by Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding
election under state, local or foreign Tax Law) with respect to the
acquisition of the U.S. Shares hereunder (collectively, the " _Section
338(h)(10) Election_ "). Sellers and Buyer shall file all Tax Returns
consistent with such Section 338(h)(10) Election and hereby agree not to take
any action that could cause such Section 338(h)(10) Election to be invalid,
and shall not take any position contrary thereto unless required to do so
pursuant to a determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any
similar state, local or foreign tax provision). Buyer shall prepare copies of
IRS Form 8023 (Elections Under Section 338 for Corporations Making Qualified

required, Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer in the preparation of such
Section 338 Forms, and Buyer and Sellers shall deliver duly executed final
copies of such Section 338 Forms on the Closing Date. Sellers, the Company and
Buyer shall also cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and
appropriate (including filing such additional forms, Tax Returns, elections,
schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve the
Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the provisions of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (and comparable provisions of each
applicable state, local or foreign Law) or any successor provisions.

(b) The Company Purchase Price (plus liabilities of the Company, to the
extent such liabilities should be included in determining the "aggregate
deemed sales price" and the "adjusted grossed-up basis" as described in
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.338-4 and 1.338-5, respectively) shall be
allocated among the assets of the Company in accordance with Sections 338 and
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar
provisions of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate) based on an
appraisal of the fair market value of the assets of the Company as of the
Closing Date prepared at Buyers expense by Valuation Research Corporation
(the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation shall be delivered by Buyer
to Sellers Representative within sixty (60) days after the final
determination of Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness pursuant
to _Section 2.04_.

 

(c) The Allocation shall be revised to appropriately take into account any
other payments made pursuant to _Sections 2.04_ ,  _2.06_ , _6.05_ , or
_9.02_ , or any other provision of this Agreement, and Buyer shall deliver to
Sellers Representative an amended Allocation reflecting any such revisions.
The Sellers Representative shall have fifteen (15) days to provide Buyer,

 



9  through a written notice of objection delivered by the Sellers
Representative, with any objections to the amended Allocation delivered by
Buyer. The Sellers Representative and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any such objection. If a final resolution is not
obtained within thirty (30) days after Buyer has received the written notice
of objection from the Sellers Representative, Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall submit the issue(s) in dispute to a jointly retained
accounting firm (which may be the same as or different from the Accountant)
for resolution. The determination of such accounting firm shall be set
forth in a written notice delivered to Buyer and the Sellers Representative
by such accounting firm and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder. Each Party shall bear its own attorneys fees, costs and
expenses relating to such dispute and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses
invoiced by such accounting firm relating to such dispute shall be paid fifty
percent (50%) by Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

 

(d) Buyer, Sellers, their respective Affiliates and any other applicable
Persons (each a " _Tax Filing Party_ ") shall file all Tax Returns consistent
with the Allocation (as it may be amended pursuant to _Section 2.07(c)_),
including IRS Form 8883 (Asset Allocation Statement Under Section 338), using
where applicable the "aggregate deemed sales price" and the "adjusted
grossed-up basis" as described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.338-4 and
1.338-5, respectively. Each Tax Filing Party shall not take any Tax position
inconsistent with such Allocation and no Tax Filing Party shall agree to any
proposed adjustment to the Allocation by any Taxing Authority without first
giving the other Parties prior written notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained herein shall prevent a Tax Filing Party from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or
arising out of the Allocation, and no Tax Filing Party shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Governmental Authority challenging such Allocation.

recent plan year with respect to the Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor
the U.K. Affiliate has made any binding plan or commitment to establish any
new Benefit Plan, to modify any Benefit Plan (except to the extent required by

tax-qualification determination letter or may

 



23  rely upon an opinion letter from the United States Internal Revenue Service
(the " _IRS_ ") and, to Sellers Knowledge, there are no circumstances that

governmental licenses, authorizations, Permits, consents and approvals
required to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business
as now conducted. Buyer is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the
character of its properties, or in which the transaction of its business,
makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed
or qualified would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or delay the ability of Buyer to
enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.02. _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby are within the corporate
powers of Buyer and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Buyer and constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of Buyer, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally
and to general principles of equity. Each other Transaction Document shall be

valid and binding agreement of Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws

performance by Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby require no action by

its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 4.04.  _Noncontravention_. __ The execution, delivery and performance
by Buyer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby do not and shall not (i)
violate the Organizational Documents of Buyer, (ii) assuming compliance with

Buyer or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of
Buyer (except, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), as would not reasonably

delay the ability of Buyer to enter into and perform its obligations under
this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby).

to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened against Buyer that would reasonably be

the manner currently conducted, or otherwise to interfere with, prevent or
delay the ability of Buyer to enter into and perform its obligations under
this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.07. _Solvency_. Buyer is not entering into this Agreement or the

ARTICLE VI

TAX MATTERS

Section 6.01.  _Representations Relating to Taxes_. Except as set forth in
the Disclosure Schedule (but subject to _Section 12.12_), Sellers hereby
jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer that:

 

(a) The Company is an "S Corporation" (within the meaning of Section 1361 of
the Code) for which a valid election under Section 1362 of the Code is and
has been in effect at all times since December 1, 1991 and that is and has
been in effect at all times since December 1, 1991 for state or local Income
Tax purposes in all jurisdictions in which the Company has been obligated to
file Income Tax Returns other than those state and local jurisdictions that do
not recognize "S Corporation" elections as identified in _Schedule 6.01(a)_.

 

(b) The Company has not in the past ten (10) years (i) acquired assets from
another corporation in a transaction in which the Companys Tax basis in the
acquired assets was determined by reference (in whole or in part) to the Tax
basis of the acquired assets (or any other property) in the hands of the
transferor or (ii) acquired the stock of any corporation that the Company
elected to treat as a "qualified subchapter S subsidiary."

 



40 (c) All Income Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns required to have
been filed by or with respect to the Company or the U.K. Affiliate have been
duly and timely filed (taking into account any applicable extensions of time
to file) with the appropriate Governmental Authority, and all such Tax Returns
are accurate and complete in all material respects. Neither the Company nor
the U.K. Affiliate is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any Tax Return. The Company and the U.K. Affiliate have
made available to Buyer (i) complete and accurate copies of all Tax Returns

prepared by, and all correspondence with, any Governmental Authority with
respect to Taxes, or the Tax Periods described in the preceding clause (i), of
the Company and the U.K. Affiliate, and (iii) all statements of Tax
deficiency or assessment claimed, proposed or assessed against the Company or
the U.K. Affiliate. _Schedule 6.01(c)_ sets forth the details of all special
arrangements (i.e., arrangements that are not based on a strict application

published statements of practice) in relation to the Tax affairs of the U.K.
Affiliate.

(d) All material Taxes due and payable by the Company and the U.K. Affiliate,
whether or not shown or reportable on any Tax Return, have been paid. The

applicable Balance Sheet did not exceed the accruals and reserves for Taxes
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and tax income) set forth on the face of
the applicable Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto). Since the
date of the applicable Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor the U.K.
Affiliate has incurred any Liability for Taxes outside the Ordinary Course of
Business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice, and neither
the Company nor the U.K. Affiliate has any liability for Taxes in excess of

where the Company or the U.K. Affiliate does not file Tax Returns that it is
or may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. 

(f) There are no Liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet due and
payable) upon the assets and properties of the Company or the U.K. Affiliate.

incorporation, and the U.K. Affiliate is not and has never been an agent or
permanent establishment of another Person for any Tax purposes.

 

(v) The U.K. Affiliate is a close company within the meaning of Section 439 of
the U.K. Corporation Tax Act 2010 (the " _CTA 2010_ "). No distributions
within Section 1064 of the CTA 2010 have been made by the U.K. Affiliate.
_Schedule 6.01(v)_ contains details of any loans or advances made, or agreed
to be made, by the U.K. Affiliate within Sections 455, 459 and/or 460 of the
CTA 2010, and the U.K. Affiliate has not released or written off, or agreed to
release or write off, the whole or any part of any such loans or advances.

Section 6.02. _Tax Returns; Allocation of Taxes_.

(a) (i) Sellers shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
when due (taking into account any extension of a required filing date), all
Tax Returns of the Company and the U.K. Affiliate that are required to be
filed on or prior to the Closing Date, and all Income Tax Returns of the
Company related to Tax Periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date, including the Companys Tennessee
FandE Tax Return for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Date Tennessee F andE Tax Return_"). Sellers shall pay or cause to be
paid all Taxes with respect to any such Tax Return in accordance with Law;
Sellers shall be entitled to receive and retain from the Internal Revenue
Service the S Corporation Tax Deposit.

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, when
due (taking into account any extensions of a required filing date) all other
Tax Returns of the Company and the U.K. Affiliate required to be filed after
the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Tax
Period (each a " _Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Tax Return_ ").

(iii) All Tax Returns described in this _Section 6.02(a)_ shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practice and without a change of any election
or any

 



44  accounting method except to the extent such position lacks sufficient
support in law or in fact to meet a "more-likely-than-not" standard;
_provided_ , _however_ , (A) the Excise Tax shall be reported on the Closing
Date Tennessee FandE Tax Return, and (B) the Excise Tax, the Company Employee
Bonus Amount and the Accrued Compensation Expense shall be reported as
deductions on the Companys federal S Corporation Income Tax Return for the
taxable period that ends on the Closing Date.

(iv) Any Tax Return described in this _Section 6.02(a)_ shall be submitted
by the Party preparing such Tax Return (the " _Tax Preparing Party_ ")
(together with schedules, statements and, to the extent reasonably requested,
supporting documentation) to the other Party or Parties at least thirty (30)
days (or, in the case of any Tax Return that is not an Income Tax Return, a
reasonable number of days) prior to the due date (including any applicable
extension) of such Tax Return. Each Party shall have the right to review and
comment on such Tax Return. If a Party, within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of any such Tax Return, notifies the Tax Preparing Party in writing
that it objects to any items in such Tax Return, the disputed item shall be
resolved in a manner mutually agreeable to the Parties within ten (10)
Business Days, and if not so resolved, then by a jointly retained accounting
firm (which may be the same as or different from the Accountant) within a
reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such Tax Return.
Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be adjusted
to reflect such resolution and shall be binding upon the Parties
without further adjustment. The costs, fees and expenses of such accounting
firm shall be borne by the Tax Preparing Party unless such accounting firm
adopts the Tax Preparing Partys position, and in such case, the costs, fees
and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne by the other Party. With
respect to the Companys Form 1120 S for the Tax Period that ends on the
Closing Date and the Closing Date Tennessee FandE Tax Return, if such Tax
Returns are prepared consistent with the Allocation, in accordance with the
past practices of the Company and consistent with the treatment of the Company
as an S corporation in those jurisdictions that recognize "S Corporation"
elections, then Sellers shall not be required to make changes requested by
Buyer, Buyer shall not have a consent right and no dispute shall be submitted
to such accounting firm.

(v) Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision
of state, local or foreign Law), none of the Company, the U.K. Affiliate or
their respective Affiliates shall amend any Tax Return or agree to the waiver
or any extension of the statute of limitations relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a Straddle Tax Period of the Company or the U.K. Affiliate without
the prior written consent of Sellers, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all
Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed Tax Return filed under
this  _Section 6.02(a)_ in accordance with Law. Sellers shall pay to Buyer
an amount equal to any Pre-Closing Taxes shown on any Pre-Closing Buyer-Filed
Tax Return prepared in compliance with this _Section 6.02(a)_, to the extent
not paid at or before the Closing or included in the calculation of Final
Closing Net Working Capital, within five (5) days prior to the latest date on
which such Taxes are due and payable without interest or penalties.

 



45 (vi) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Section 338(h)(10) Elections contemplated by _Section 2.07_), Buyer
shall not cause the Company to take any action on the Closing Date that is
outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

(b) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Sellers any refund (whether by way
of payment, credit, offset or reduction in Tax Liability) of Taxes and
interest thereon received by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer attributable to
Pre-Closing Taxes paid by Sellers, the Company or the U.K. Affiliate no later
than ten (10) days following receipt of such refund, net of any Income
Taxes imposed thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be
obligated to pay over any refunds or the amount of any credit, offset or Tax
reduction to the extent such refund or benefit was included in Final Closing
Net Working Capital. The amount of any Tax deposits, estimated payments or
overpayments existing on the Closing Date in respect of Income Taxes of the
Company or the U.K. Affiliate shall be for the account of Sellers and shall be
applied first to any related Pre-Closing Taxes, as determined pursuant to the
relevant Tax Return for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all excise,
sales, use, value added, registration stamp, recording, documentary,
conveyancing, property, transfer and similar Taxes, levies, charges and fees
arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
equally by Buyer and Sellers.

Section 6.03. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

(a) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, in connection with the
preparation, execution and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to _Section
6.02(a)_ and any audit, examination, inquiry, claim for refund, lawsuit,
action, claim, arbitration, mediation or other proceeding at law or in equity
by or before a Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes (each a " _Tax Claim_
"). Such cooperation shall include access to records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Claim, making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder and executing powers of
attorney. Sellers and Buyer shall retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the U.K. Affiliate
relating to any Tax Period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of the respective Tax
Periods or Tax matters and abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Taxing Authority. Buyer and Sellers each agree, upon request, to
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(b) In the event that a portion of the Company Employee Bonus Amount is repaid
to Sellers in accordance with _Section 7.04(c)_, Buyer and the Company shall
cooperate with Sellers and the Sellers Representative to file amended Income
Tax Returns of the Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods as may be necessary. In
the event any Taxing Authority disallows (i) any portion of the Company
Employee Bonus Amount or (ii) the pre-closing accrual for the Employee Profit
Sharing Plan as a deduction on an Income Tax Return for the Tax Period ending

 



46  on the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay Sellers an amount equal to the
incremental economic benefit, if any, attributable to the Income Tax savings
realized by the Company on account of such amounts being deducted as
compensation by the Company with respect to a Tax Period that ends after the
Closing Date; in such event, Sellers Representative and Buyer shall work
together in good faith to determine the amount payable to Sellers hereunder.
If a final resolution is not obtained within thirty (30) days after good faith
discussions between the parties begin, Buyer and Sellers Representative shall
submit the issue or issues in dispute to a jointly retained accounting firm
(which may be the same as or different from the Accountant) for resolution.
The determination of such accounting firm shall be set forth in a written
notice delivered to Buyer and Sellers Representative by such accounting firm
and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. Each Party shall
bear its own attorneys fees, costs and expenses relating to such dispute and
all reasonable fees, costs and expenses invoiced by such accounting firm
relating to such dispute shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Sellers and
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

Section 6.04.  _[Intentionally Deleted]_.

Section 6.05. _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) Except to the extent taken into account in the calculation of Final
Closing Net Working Capital, Sellers hereby indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates against and agree to hold each of them harmless from any and all
(i) Liability for Pre-Closing Taxes of the Company and the U.K. Affiliate;
(ii) Liability for Taxes of Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than
the Company or the U.K. Affiliate), including Sellers share of Taxes
referenced in _Section 6.02(c)_; (iii) Losses (including lost Tax benefits
resulting from an invalid Section 338(h)(10) Election) arising out of,
resulting from, or incident to any breach by Sellers or any of their
Affiliates (including the Company or the U.K. Affiliate prior to the Closing)
of any covenant contained in this _Article VI_ or _Section 2.07_; and (iv)
Losses (including lost Tax benefits resulting from an invalid Section
338(h)(10) Election) arising out of, resulting from, or incident to any breach
of any representation or warranty contained in _Section 6.01_ without regard
to any qualification or exception contained in such representation or
warranty relating to materiality, Material Adverse Effect, material adverse
effect, Company Adverse Effect or any similar qualification, dollar threshold
or standard applicable thereto, except to the extent such Losses are
otherwise indemnified pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii). For
purposes of this _Section 6.05(a)_, Taxes shall include the amount of Taxes
that would have been payable but for the application of any credit, loss,
deduction or relief attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Sellers indemnification obligations for Liability for Taxes
related to a Post-Closing Tax Period resulting from breaches
of representations and warranties made in Section 6.01 (other than the
representations and warranties contained in Section 6.01(a)) shall be limited
to Losses arising in Tax Periods ending on or prior to: (A) the Closing Date
with respect to breaches of Section 6.01(b), (c), (d), (e) or (g), and (B)
the later of (i) December 31, 2012 or (ii) twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date, with respect to breaches of Section 6.01 not described in the
preceding clause (A) (other than Section 6.01(a)).

(b) Buyer hereby indemnifies Sellers and their Affiliates against and agrees
to hold each of them harmless from any and all (i) Liability for Taxes of the
Company or the U.K. Affiliate for Post-Closing Tax Periods, except to the
extent such Taxes are subject to indemnification by Sellers pursuant to
_Section 6.05(a)_; and (ii) Losses arising out of, resulting

 



47  from or incident to any breach by Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company after Closing) of any covenant contained in this _Article VI_ ; and
(iii) Buyers share of Taxes referenced in _Section 6.02(c)_.

(c) In the case of any Straddle Tax Period:

 

(i) Real, personal and intangible property Taxes and any other Taxes levied on
a per diem basis (" _Per Diem Taxes_ ") of any Person for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes for the entire
Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the Straddle Tax Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the
Straddle Tax Period; and

(ii) Taxes of any Person (other than Per Diem Taxes) for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be computed as if such Tax Period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date.

 

(iii) All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth
in this _Section 6.05(c)_ shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Company or the U.K. Affiliate, as applicable.

(d) If any Tax Claim shall be initiated, which, if successful, might result
in an indemnity payment to a Person pursuant to this _Section 6.05_, the
Indemnified Parties shall notify the Indemnifying Parties within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of notice of such a Tax Claim; _provided_ that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent the Indemnifying Parties have actually been prejudiced by
such failure.

 

(e) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, Sellers shall control all proceedings and may make all
decisions in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel)
at its own expense. With respect to Tax Claims relating to Straddle Tax
Periods, to the extent possible, Tax Liabilities will be distinguished and
each Party shall control the defense and settlement of those Taxes for which
it is so liable. To the extent a Tax Liability cannot be so attributed, the
Party that has the greater potential Liability shall control the defense and
settlement;  _provided_ that such Party defends the Tax issue as reported on
the relevant Tax Return. Buyer shall control at its own expense all
proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period beginning
after the Closing Date. A Party shall promptly notify the other Parties if it
decides not to control the defense or settlement of any Tax Claim that it is
entitled to control pursuant to this Agreement, and any other Party shall
thereupon be permitted to defend and settle such Tax Claim at its own
expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.05(e)_,
neither Buyer nor Sellers shall settle any Tax Claim without the other Partys
(with Sellers being considered one Party) prior written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if the resolution of
such Tax Claim reasonably could be expected to materially adversely affect the
Tax Liability of such other Party or its Affiliates (including pursuant
to such Partys indemnification obligations under _Section 6.05(a)_ or (b)).

 



48 Section 6.06. _Survival of Tax Claims_. Claims under  _Section 6.05_ shall
survive the Closing until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute
of limitations (including extensions) applicable to the relevant Tax matter.
No claim may be made or brought by any Party hereto after the expiration of
the applicable survival period unless such claim has been asserted by written
notice specifying the details supporting the claim on or prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period.

 

Section 6.07. _Satisfaction of Claims_. Claims made by Buyer or its Affiliates
for indemnification under  _Section 6.05_ shall be satisfied, in the sole
discretion of Buyer, from funds held in (a) the Indemnity Escrow Account, (b)
by payment of cash or other immediately available funds from Sellers (such
obligations of payment shall be joint and several amongst them), or (c) by an
offset to any Earn-Out Payment pursuant to _Sections 9.04(b)_ and _9.04 (c)_.

ARTICLE VII

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 7.01. _Compensation and Benefits_. Buyer agrees that from the Closing
through November 30, 2012 (the " _Relevant Period_ "), it shall provide (or
cause its Subsidiaries to provide) each Company Employee with an annual base
salary or hourly wage and cash incentive compensation opportunities that have
a target value at least equal to his or her annual base salary and target
incentive compensation opportunities in effect immediately prior to the
Closing. In addition, Buyer agrees that during the Relevant Period, it shall
provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to provide) Company Employees with
benefits and perquisites that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable
to the Benefit Plans provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as set forth in  _Schedule
7.01_ , Buyer shall not be obligated to provide any Company Employee with any
post-retirement medical or life benefits. Buyer agrees that after the
expiration of the Relevant Period, it shall provide (or cause its Subsidiaries
to provide) Company Employees with compensation and benefits that are, in the
aggregate, substantially comparable to the compensation and benefits provided
to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees that it shall provide (or cause its
Subsidiaries to provide) (i) each U.S. Company Employee listed in _Schedule
7.04(a)_ for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 full participation in the Employee
Profit Sharing Plan, (ii) each U.S. Company Employee listed in _Schedule
7.04(b)_ for fiscal year 2012 full participation and for fiscal year 2011
partial participation (based on the number of days in such fiscal year
following the Closing Date) in the Executive Profit Sharing Program, and
(iii) each U.K. Company Employee for fiscal year 2012 full participation and
for fiscal year 2011 partial participation (based on the number of days in
such fiscal year following the Closing Date) in the Executive Profit Sharing
Program or the U.K. Affiliates profit sharing program as in effect on the
date hereof, as applicable, in each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) consistent
with the past practices of the Company and the U.K. Affiliate prior to the
Closing. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries to replicate any benefits arising under an occupational pension
scheme, including any benefits which relate to old age, invalidity or
survivors.

 

Section 7.02. _Severance_. __ Notwithstanding _Section 7.01_, for a period of
twenty-four (24) months following the Closing, Buyer agrees to cause the
Company and the U.K. Affiliate to provide severance to Company Employees
according to the severance set forth in _Schedule 7.02_.

 



49 Section 7.03. _Service Crediting for Buyer Plans_. Buyer hereby agrees that,
from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall grant all Company Employees
credit for any service with the Company or the U.K. Affiliate earned prior to
the Closing Date for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for eligibility
for or benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan maintained by Buyer)
and for purposes of vacation and sick day accrual under any benefit plan,
program or arrangement established or maintained by or on behalf of Buyer on
or after the Closing Date in which the Company Employees are eligible to
participate (the " _Buyer Plans_ ") to the same extent such service was
recognized under a similar Benefit Plan, except, in each case, (a) to the
extent that such treatment would result in duplicative benefits, or (b) under
a Buyer Plan that is operated by a third party and does not permit the
amendment of such Buyer Plan to credit such service. With respect to each
Buyer Plan, Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall (i) cause to be
waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability
requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations
under such Buyer Plan, and (ii) cause each Company Employee eligible
to participate in the Buyer Plans to be given credit under such plans for all
amounts paid by such Company Employee under any similar Benefit Plan for the
plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Buyer Plan
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable, for the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs.

 

Section 7.04. _Distribution of Employee Compensation Bonus Amount_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Sellers shall (i) cause the Company to irrevocably commit
to pay through the Companys next regular payroll process a portion of the
Company Employee Bonus Amount (less required applicable withholdings for
federal, state, local or employment taxes) to each U.S. Company Employee set
forth in _Schedule 7.04(a)_ set forth opposite such U.S. Company Employees
name in _Schedule 7.04(a)_ ; and (ii) cause the U.K. Affiliate to irrevocably
commit to pay through the U.K. Affiliates next regular payroll process to
U.K. Company Employees set forth in _Schedule 7.04(a) _ the amount (less
applicable withholding taxes) set forth opposite such U.K. Company Employees
name in _Schedule 7.04(a)_ ; _provided_ , that with respect to any individual
Company Employee listed on _Schedule 7.04(a)_ , such Company Employee is
employed by the Company or the U.K. Affiliate, as applicable, on the Closing
Date.

(b) At the Closing, Sellers shall cause the Company to irrevocably commit to
pay through the Companys next regular payroll process a portion of the
Company Employee Bonus Amount (less required applicable withholdings for
federal, state, local or employment taxes) to each U.S. Company Employee set
forth in _Schedule 7.04(b)_ set forth opposite such U.S. Company Employees
name in _Schedule 7.04(b)_ ; _provided_ , that such U.S. Company Employee is
employed by the Company on the Closing Date and; _provided, further_ , that
prior to the Closing, the Company shall have obtained an executed agreement,
in the form mutually agreed upon by the Parties on or prior to the date of
this Agreement, (each a " _Bonus Agreement_ ") from each such U.S. Company
Employee providing that one-half of the amount set forth opposite such U.S.
Company Employees name in _Schedule 7.04(b)_ shall be repaid to the Company
in the event that such U.S. Company Employee is terminated for cause or
voluntarily terminates his or her employment with Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Company) before the earlier to occur of (i) December 1, 2012 or
(ii) the first anniversary of the Closing Date;  _provided_ however, that
such repayment obligations may be waived by Sellers Representative in his
sole discretion.

 



50 (c) Any portion of the Company Employee Bonus Amount repaid to the Company
after the Closing pursuant to any Bonus Agreement shall be distributed to the
Sellers Representative for distribution to Sellers identified as holders of
the U.S. Shares on _Exhibit A_, in the proportions set forth on _Exhibit
A_. 

(d) The payments made pursuant to _Sections 7.04(a)_ and _7.04(b)_ include the
amount due to each Company Employee who participates in the Executive Profit
Sharing Program through the Closing Date and shall reduce any amounts due to
such Company Employees pursuant to the Executive Profit Share Program at year
end.

 

(e) If a U.S. Company Employee fails to repay any amount owed pursuant to
_Section 7.04(b)_, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by Law, assign
its rights to proceed against such U.S. Company Employee as is necessary to
permit the Sellers to recover from the U.S. Company Employee the amount of
such repayment; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to assign
any right to proceed against such Company Employee if the Company determines
in its reasonable discretion that such assignment would be materially
detrimental to its reputation or future business prospects.

 

Section 7.05. _Acknowledgement_. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that
nothing contained in this _Article VII_ shall be construed to limit in any
way the ability of Buyer or the U.K. Affiliate to terminate the employment of
any Company Employee from and after the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.06. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this _Article VII_ ,
express or implied, is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under this Agreement upon any Person (including any
Company Employees or other current or former employees) other than the Parties
to this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns to continued
employment or any severance or other benefits from Sellers, the Company, the
U.K. Affiliate, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing contained
in this _Article VII_ shall be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan.
Subject to applicable Law, unless otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, including this _Article VII_, no provision of this Agreement shall
constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify or terminate,
either before or after the Closing, any such Benefit Plan.

ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 9.01. _Survival_. __ Except for matters related to Taxes, which are
addressed in _Article VI_ , the representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date; _provided_ that the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.18_ (Environmental
Matters) shall survive

 



53  for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date; _provided, further_ ,
that the Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties
contained in  _Section 4.01_ (Corporate Existence and Power) and _Section
4.02_ (Authorization) shall survive indefinitely. Except for matters relating
to Taxes, which are addressed in _Article VI_ , all of the covenants contained
in this Agreement that by their nature are required to be performed after the
Closing shall survive the Closing until fully performed or fulfilled.
Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, any breach or inaccuracy of any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding two sentences, if notice of the
breach or inaccuracy thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall
have been given to the Party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior
to such time.

Section 9.02. _Indemnification_.

(a) Except with respect to matters relating to Taxes, which are addressed in
_Article VI_ , and subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.02_,
effective at and after the Closing, Sellers, jointly and severally, agree to
indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates (excluding the U.K. Affiliate),
equityholders, directors, officers, employees, successors, permitted assigns,
agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") against
and agree to hold each of them harmless from any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee arising out of or relating to:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers in _Article III_
or in any Cross-Indemnity Agreement; _provided_ that Sellers obligations
pursuant to this _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ with respect to any breach of 
_Section 3.19(b)_ due to a recall of any Products and Services shall be
limited to only Losses arising out of or relating to those Products and
Services subject to such recall sold prior to the Closing Date;

 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by
Sellers, the Company, the U.K. Affiliate or their respective Affiliates
pursuant to this Agreement or any Cross-Indemnity Agreement; or

(iii) the matters listed in _Schedule 9.02(a)(iii)_.

_provided_ that (A) with respect to indemnification by Sellers pursuant to 
_Section 9.02(a)(i)_, Sellers shall not be liable for any breach of any
representation or warranty of Sellers (x) attributable to a single course of
conduct or related set of facts, events or circumstances unless the amount of
Losses suffered associated with such breach exceeds One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000) (the " _Mini-Basket_ "); (y) unless the aggregate amount of
Losses associated with all such breaches exceeds Three Million Dollars
($3,000,000) (the " _Basket_ "), after which point Sellers will be obligated
to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for all Losses, including those accrued in
the Basket; and (B) in no event shall Sellers aggregate Liability arising out
of or relating to _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ exceed Seventy-Five Million Dollars
($75,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "), _provided, further_ , that in no event shall
the Mini-Basket, the Basket or the Cap apply to any Losses arising out of
the breach of any Fundamental Representation, which, in each case, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover in their entirety.

 



54 (b) Except with respect to matters relating to Taxes, which are addressed in
_Article VI_ , and subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.02_,
effective at and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify Sellers and
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, successors,
permitted assigns, agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ ") against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and
all Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnitee arising out of or
relating to:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer in this Agreement or
any Cross-Indemnity Agreement; or 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or any Cross-Indemnity
Agreement;

_provided_ that (A) with respect to indemnification by Buyer pursuant to 
_Section 9.02(b)(i)_, Buyer shall not be liable for any breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer (x) attributable to a single course of
conduct or related set of facts, events or circumstances unless the amount of
Losses suffered associated with such breach exceeds the Mini-Basket; (y)
unless the aggregate amount of Losses associated with all such breaches
exceeds the Basket, after which point Buyer will be obligated to indemnify the
Seller Indemnitees for all Losses, including those accrued in the Basket; and
(B) in no event shall Buyers aggregate Liability arising out of or relating
to _Section 9.02(b)(i)_ exceed the Cap, _provided, further_ , that in no
event shall the Mini-Basket, Basket or the Cap apply to any Losses arising
out of the breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Section
4.01_ (Corporate Existence and Power) and _Section 4.02_ (Authorization),
which, in each case, the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover in
their entirety.

(c) For purposes of _Sections 9.02_ , a breach of any representation or
warranty shall be determined without regard to any qualification or exception
contained in such representation or warranty relating to materiality, Material
Adverse Effect, material adverse effect, Company Adverse Effect or any
similar qualification, dollar threshold or standard applicable thereto.

(d) All Losses relating to Taxes, which are addressed in _Article VI_ , shall
only be subject to indemnification under _Section 6.05_ (as such
indemnification is qualified or limited by _Sections 9.02(e)_ , _9.02(g)_ ,
_9.07_ , _9.08_ and _9.09_ ) and the indemnification procedures set forth in
_Article VI_ shall control any indemnities relating to Taxes.

(e) Regardless of whether any Party or any of their Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives had or should have had knowledge or notice of
(i) the breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty of the
other Party, (ii) the failure of any condition for its benefit to be
satisfied, or (iii) the breach of any covenant for its benefit (or, in the
case of any of clause (i), (ii) or (iii), any facts or circumstances which
would result in any such breach, inaccuracy or failure), for purposes of this
Agreement, such Party or Parties shall not be deemed to have waived such
breach or inaccuracy or condition or be limited or precluded in recovering any
Losses related thereto.

 



55 (f) Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the limits on indemnification set forth in _Sections 9.02(a)_ and
_9.02(b)_ do not in any way limit the obligation of any Party to indemnify the
other Party or Parties from and against any Losses arising from any breach of
a covenant, even if such breach also constitutes a breach of a representation
or warranty; _provided_ that no Party may recover duplicate recoveries in
respect of any single Loss.

(g) The Parties shall treat any payments made pursuant to _Section 6.05_ or
this _Section 9.02_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Income Tax
purposes, unless a determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of
the Code (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign Law))
requires such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for Income Tax purposes. In the event that adjustments to the Purchase Price
are made pursuant to this _Section 9.02_, to the extent any such adjustment
is not obviously allocated in its entirety to either the Company Purchase
Price or the U.K. Affiliate Purchase Price, Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall cooperate and mutually agree on adjustment to the
Allocation.

Section 9.03.  _Satisfaction of Claims_. Claims made by a Buyer Indemnitee
for indemnification under _Section 9.02(a)_ shall be satisfied first from
funds held in the Indemnity Escrow Account and then by payment of cash or
other immediately available funds from Sellers (such obligations of payment
shall be joint and several amongst them), or, at the sole discretion of Buyer,
by an offset to any Earn-Out Payment pursuant to _Sections 9.04(b)_ and _9.04
(c)_.

 

Section 9.04. _Disbursement of Escrow Account; Buyer s Offset Right_.

 

(a) On the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date (or in the event such
date is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately following such
date), the Escrow Agent shall release one-third (1/3) of the then existing
Indemnification Escrow Amount to Sellers to be disbursed pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, less the amount of claims for indemnification properly
asserted by Buyer Indemnitees which have not been paid, and any unreleased
amount shall be retained by the Escrow Agent. On the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (or in the event such date is not a Business
Day, the Business Day immediately following such date), the Escrow Agent
shall release one-half (1/2) of the then existing Indemnification Escrow
Amount to Sellers to be disbursed pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, less the
amount of claims for indemnification properly asserted by Buyer Indemnitees
which have not been paid, and any unreleased amount shall be retained by the
Escrow Agent. On the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (or
in the event such date is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately
following such date), the Escrow Agent shall release the then remaining
Indemnification Escrow Amount (and any interest earned thereon) to Sellers to
be disbursed pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, less the amount of claims for
indemnification properly asserted by Buyer Indemnitees which have not been
paid, and any unreleased amount shall be retained by the Escrow Agent. The
amount of the Indemnification Escrow Amount (and any interest earned
thereon) so retained shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the extent not
utilized to pay Buyer Indemnitees for any such claims resolved in favor of
Buyer Indemnitees) in accordance with the resolution of such claims to Sellers
to be disbursed pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

 



56 (b) Buyer shall have the right to deduct from and offset against any Earn-Out
Payment, the amount of any Losses in respect of which it is agreed by the
Parties in writing, or otherwise finally determined pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, that any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
hereunder, including pursuant to  _Article VI_ and _Section 9.02_, and for
which such Buyer Indemnitee has not already received an indemnification
payment under this _Article IX_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this _Article IX_ to the
contrary, in the event that a Buyer Indemnitee has (i) delivered to Sellers an
indemnification claim pursuant to  _Section 9.04_ and (ii) such
indemnification claim has not been fully and finally agreed to or resolved
pursuant to this Agreement, including, as applicable, payment in full of any
amounts in respect thereof to the Buyer Indemnitee (each, an " _Unresolved
Claim_ "), then with respect to the aggregate amount of any Losses claimed by
any Buyer Indemnitee under an Unresolved Claim which is in excess of the
amount then in the Indemnity Escrow Account (the " _Unresolved Claim Amount_
"), the Parties agree that, with respect to any Unresolved Claim Amount that
exists prior to the payment of any Earn-Out Payment, Buyer shall be entitled
to holdback from the amount of such Earn-Out Payment otherwise payable
hereunder the full amount of such Unresolved Claim Amount. Upon final
agreement by the Parties or other final determination hereunder of any
Unresolved Claim, (A) Buyer shall be entitled to retain for its own account,
and deduct from and off-set against the Earn-Out Payment, any amount of such
Unresolved Claim that is finally agreed or determined to be payable to any
Buyer Indemnitee, or (B) Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days of such
final agreement or determination, pay to the Sellers Representative, on
behalf of Sellers identified as owners of the U.S. Shares on _Exhibit A_ , any
amount of such Unresolved Claim for which such right of setoff was determined
to be not justified. 

Section 9.05. _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) The Party seeking indemnification under this _Article IX_ (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give prompt notice to any Party against whom
indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of any
claim, or the commencement of any Legal Proceeding in respect of which
indemnity may be sought pursuant to this _Article IX_ and shall provide the
Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except
to the extent that such failure shall have actually prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under _Section 9.02_
which is asserted by any third party (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") and, subject
to the limitations set forth in this _Section 9.05_, shall be entitled to
control and appoint lead counsel (subject to the written approval of the
Indemnified Party which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) for such defense or resolution, in each case at the Indemnifying
Partys expense. The Indemnifying Party shall not have any indemnification
obligation with respect to any Third-Party Claim settled without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

 



57 (c) The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) Business Days after having received notice from the Indemnified
Party of the Third-Party Claim with respect to whether or not it is exercising
its right to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third-Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Section 9.02(b)_ within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of any
notice of such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall defend,
and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder and
subject to the limitations contained in this  _Section 9.05(c)_) in regard
to the Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, in
all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently
by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the control of
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, before entering into
any settlement or other resolution of such Third-Party Claim or before
conducting any activity that would reasonably be expected to have an adverse
impact on the Indemnified Party if (A) the settlement does not release the
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third-Party Claim, (B) the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party or (C) the settlement requires admission
of error, or admission of responsibility, and (ii) the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and
to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and
expenses of such separate counsel employed by the Indemnified Party pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall be paid by the Indemnified Party; _provided_
that, if the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after consultation with
its counsel, that there is a conflict of interest (including one or more
legal defenses or counterclaims available to it which are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party) that makes it
inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party, the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party; _provided, further_ , that in
no event shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees and expenses
of more than one lead counsel for all Indemnified Parties and the reasonable
fees and expenses of any local counsel necessary for such lead counsel to
secure admission to appear before the relevant adjudicative forum.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled
to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim (and shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party
in defending such Third-Party Claim) if (A) the Third-Party Claim seeks an
order, injunction or other equitable relief or other relief for other than
money damages against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot
be separated from any related claim for money damages, _provided_ that if
such equitable relief or other relief portion of the Third-Party Claim can be
so separated from that for money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume defense of the portion relating to money damages, and
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by
the Indemnified Party in defending the balance of such Third-Party Claim, or
(B) the potential Losses under the Third-Party Claim would reasonably and in
good faith be expected to exceed, (x) the applicable Cap _minus_ the aggregate
amount of all Losses that are subject to such Cap paid or subject to an
outstanding claim for indemnification, from time to time, by the Indemnifying
Parties to all the Indemnified Parties (y) _times_ two (2) under this
_Article IX_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the Parties are not
in agreement with respect to 

 



58  the calculation of such potential Losses, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance
herewith until the Parties have agreed or a final non-appealable judgment has
been entered into, with respect to the determination of the potential damages;
_provided, further_ , that prior to such determination the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and
to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, and such separate
counsel fees shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party.

(d) Each Party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to
be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith, _provided_ that no Party shall
have an obligation to cooperate, make available personnel or disclose any
documents or other information (i) that such Party reasonably believes may,
after undertaking commercially reasonable efforts to provide such documents
and information in a manner which would protect such privilege or
protections (including entering into customary joint defense arrangements),
adversely affect the attorney-client privilege or work product protections
related to such document or other information, or (ii) if Sellers or any of
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation and such assistance,
testimony, documents or other information is reasonably pertinent thereto;
_provided_ that this clause (d) shall not limit in any respect any rights a
Party may have with respect to discovery or the production of documents or
other information in connection with any such litigation.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section
9.05_ shall not apply to Tax Claims, which shall be governed exclusively by
_Section 6.05_.

 

Section 9.06. _[Intentionally Deleted]_.

Section 9.07. _Calculation of Losses_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

(a) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under _Article
VI_ or this _Article IX_ to the extent a Liability or reserve relating to the
matter giving rise to such Losses has been included in the calculation of
Final Closing Net Working Capital.

(b) The amount of any Loss for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement (i) shall be reduced (but not below zero)
by the amount, if any, of the net reduction in Taxes actually paid by Buyer or
its Affiliates with respect to such Loss, (ii) shall be reduced by the amount
of any payment actually received by such Indemnified Party with respect to
such Loss from a third-party insurer or other third party (net of costs or
expenses of recovery and applicable premiums and self-insured retentions); 
_provided_ that receipt of such proceeds, benefits or recoveries shall not be
a predicate to indemnification for such Loss or require the Indemnified Party
to use anything other than commercially reasonable efforts to collect any
amounts available under such insurance coverage, and (iii) shall not include
any special, punitive or exemplary damages, except to the extent the
Indemnified Party has become liable to a third party for such Losses due to a
Third-Party Claim. In addition, if, at any time

 



59  following the payment of an indemnification obligation to an Indemnified
Party with respect to a Loss under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
actually realizes any net reduction in Taxes or receives any payment by an
insurance carrier or other third party with respect to such Loss not
previously effected as a reduction payment to clauses (i) or (ii) of this
_Section 9.07(b)_, then the value of any such amount recovered by the
Indemnified Party up to the amount of such indemnification payment hereunder,
but net of any costs or expenses of recovery, shall promptly be repaid by such
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party; _provided, however_ , that the
Basket shall not be deemed exceeded if such recovery by the Indemnified Party
causes the aggregate amount of Losses subject to the Basket to fall below the
amount of the Basket; _provided_ , _further_ , that such Indemnified Party
shall not make such repayment to the extent the applicable Cap has been
exceeded. An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue all legal rights and remedies available in order to mitigate Losses for
which indemnification is provided to it under this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, each Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue, and to cause its Affiliates to pursue, all
reductions in Taxes and insurance or other third-party recoveries to which it
may be entitled in connection with any Loss it incurs, and the Parties shall
cooperate with each other in pursuing insurance and other third-party claims
with respect to any such Losses.

 

(c) In the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Losses in respect of a
claim of indemnification under _Article VI_ or this  _Article IX_ , no other
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the same Losses in respect of a
claim for indemnification.

Section 9.08. _Assignment of Claims_. __ If an Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to
_Section 9.02_ or  _Article VI_ and the Indemnified Party could have
recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party (a " _Potential
Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted against the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent permitted by
Law and any pertinent Contract, assign such of its rights to proceed against
the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to
recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment; _provided_
that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to assign any right to
proceed against a Potential Contributor if the Indemnified Party determines in
its reasonable discretion that such assignment would be
materially detrimental to its reputation or future business prospects.

Section 9.09. _Exclusivity_. __ From and after the Closing, absent fraud, the
rights of the parties to indemnification under _Article VI_ or this _Article
IX_ shall be the exclusive remedies of the Parties subsequent to the Closing
Date with respect to the recovery of any money damages any Buyer Indemnitee
or Seller Indemnitee may incur arising from or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that nothing in this
_Section 9.09_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the Parties
rights to specific performance or injunctive relief).

ARTICLE X

prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Sellers Representative and Buyer;

 



60 (b) by either Buyer or Sellers if any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, decree, ruling or
injunction (other than a temporary restraining order) or taken any other
action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ that this right of
termination shall not be available to any Party (Sellers shall be collectively

order, decree, ruling, injunction or other action;

(c) by either Buyer or Sellers if any of the conditions set forth in

Date for a further one hundred twenty (120) days by providing written notice
thereof to Buyer on or prior to the Initial Outside Date; _provided, further_
, that this right of termination shall not be available to any Party (Sellers

primarily resulted in, the failure of the conditions provided in _Sections
8.01_ , _8.02_ or _8.03_ , as applicable, to be satisfied before such date;

(d) by Buyer, upon written notice to the Sellers Representative, if there has
occurred a Material Adverse Effect;

(e) by Buyer, if Sellers shall have breached or failed to perform any of their

this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Seller shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Sections
8.02(a)_ or _8.02(b)_  would not be satisfied and such breach is incapable of
being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured not later
than the later to occur of (i) the Initial Outside Date or (ii) the date sixty
(60) days following receipt by the Sellers Representative of written notice
of such breach from Buyer; and

(f) by Sellers, if Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Buyer shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Sections

amendment, by each Party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the
Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

(b) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or

respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that no Party may assign,

64  under this Agreement without the consent of each other Party hereto;
_provided, further_ , that Buyer may assign this Agreement and any and all
rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or from time to time in part, to
any wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer at any time. Any such assignor shall
remain jointly and severally liable for its obligations and the obligations of
its permitted assignee. Upon such permitted assignment, the references in
this Agreement to Buyer shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context requires otherwise.

 

Section 12.05. _Governing Law_. __ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state. The Parties expressly waive any
right they may have, now or in the future, to demand or seek the application
of a governing law other than the law of the State of Delaware.

Section 12.06. _Jurisdiction_. __ The Parties expressly agree that any Legal
Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may be brought only in a United States District Court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware State court, so long as one
of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such Legal
Proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall
be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of
Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Legal Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in any such court or that
any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal Proceeding may be served on any
Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in  _Section 12.01_ shall be deemed
effective service of process on such Party.

Section 12.07. _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. __ EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 12.08. _Mutual Drafting_. The Parties are sophisticated and have been
represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated hereby who
have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the Parties
do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith, including the other Transaction Documents, and therefore
waive their effects.

 

Section 12.09. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. __ This Agreement may be signed
by digital facsimile and in any number of counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective
when each Party shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
Party. Until and unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by
the other Party, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have
any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication).

 



65 Section 12.10. _Entire Agreement_. __ The Transaction Documents embody the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral
and written, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. 

Section 12.11. _Severability_. __ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 12.12. _Disclosure Schedule_. __ The Parties acknowledge and agree
that (a) the inclusion of any items or information in the Disclosure Schedule
that is not required by this Agreement to be so included is solely for the
convenience of Buyer; (b) the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by
Sellers that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this
Agreement, is material, has resulted in a Company Adverse Effect or Material
Adverse Effect or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business; (c) if any
section of the Disclosure Schedule lists an item or information in such a way
as to make its relevance to the disclosure required by or provided in another
section of the Disclosure Schedule or the statements contained in any Section
of _Article III_ reasonably apparent, the matter shall be deemed to have been
disclosed in or with respect to such other section, notwithstanding the
omission of an appropriate cross-reference to such other section or the
omission of a reference in the particular representation and warranty to such
section of the Disclosure Schedule or _Article III_ hereof; (d) except as
provided in clause (c) above, headings have been inserted in the Disclosure
Schedules for convenience of reference only; and (e) the Disclosure Schedule
and the information and statements contained therein are not intended to
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations or

Section 12.13. _Specific Performance_. __ The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or other remedies at law would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge
and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
Party of any of its covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the
non-breaching Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations under this Agreement, in addition to any other
remedy that may be available at law or in equity. The Parties agree not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement.
