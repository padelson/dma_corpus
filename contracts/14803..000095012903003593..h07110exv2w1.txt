         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the

and exchange of the certificate representing such share.

                  (ii) The cash payable upon the conversion of a share of

"Merger Consideration." As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall, subject to Section
2.01(d), cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest less any required withholding
taxes.

         (d) Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any person who is
entitled to dissent from and properly dissents from this Agreement pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, Articles 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA
(the "Dissenters' Statute"), in each case to the extent applicable ("Dissent
Shares"), shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of Dissent
Shares shall be entitled to the right


                                       3
<PAGE>
to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissent Shares in accordance with
the Dissenters' Statute upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such Dissent Shares; provided, however, that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose the
right to receive payment of the fair value under the Dissenters' Statute, then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissent
Shares shall cease and such Dissent Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest less any required withholding taxes, as provided
in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
objections or demands received by the Company for payment of the fair value of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Dissenters' Statute, and Parent shall have
the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
objections or demands. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such objections or demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

         Section 2.02.     Surrender of Certificates; Payment for Shares.

         (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of Certificates (as defined in Section 2.02(b)). At or prior to the
Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock the aggregate amount of the Merger
Consideration payable in connection with the Merger (collectively, the "Exchange
Fund"). The expenses of the Paying Agent shall not be paid from the Exchange
Fund, but shall be paid directly by the Surviving Corporation or Parent. The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration in exchange for surrendered Certificates pursuant to this Section
2.02 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 2.02(d), the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

         (b) Surrender and Payment Procedure. Promptly after the Effective Time,
except as otherwise provided in the immediately succeeding sentence, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (the
"Certificates"), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a
form and have such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify
and that are reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. At least ten (10) days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, Parent shall make available to the Company a sufficient number of copies
of the letter of transmittal and instructions so that the Company can provide
them to its shareholders in advance of the Closing in order to permit
shareholders, acting through the Company, to deliver their executed letters of
transmittal and to surrender their Certificates to the Parent at the Closing,
and the Paying Agent will not be required to send a letter of transmittal and
instructions in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence to any
shareholders who so deliver their letters of transmittal and surrender their
Certificates at the Closing. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Parent or the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such


                                       4
<PAGE>
other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
cash in an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate and (B) the Merger
Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

         (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer
Books. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled upon payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II.

         (d) Termination of Exchange Fund; Investment of Exchange Fund. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (who held shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time) on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the Effective
Time and (ii) any date at least ninety (90) days after the Effective Time if the
balance of funds in the Exchange Fund is less than $10 million, shall be
returned to the Parent, upon demand, and any such former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Parent, as a general creditor thereof, for payment
of such holder's claim for the Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily
basis. The Exchange Fund may be invested only in short-term deposits with a
federally insured bank or savings and loan association having a net worth of at
least $500 million or in money market funds that only invest in securities rated
A or better by Standard & Poor's or U.S. government securities. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be Parent's property and
shall be paid to Parent upon request; provided that any losses, expenses, fees
and commissions arising therefrom shall be borne by Parent and not by any such
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock.

         (e) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any
payments or distributions payable from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental body or authority), any such Merger Consideration, to the extent
permitted by


                                       5
<PAGE>
applicable Law, shall become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

         (f) Withholding Rights. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any former holder
of shares of Company Common Stock (who held shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time) pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as may be required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or under any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to such former holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

         (g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and such person
agreeing to indemnify the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate (unless such Certificate represents more than 1,000 shares, in which
case only upon the posting by such person of a bond in the amount of 3.0% of the
Merger Consideration attributable to such lost Certificates, the Paying Agent
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.

                                   ARTICLE III

filings as may be required in connection with the Taxes (as defined in Section
3.08(f)) described in Section 6.08, and (iii) such other items which if not
obtained would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

         (c) The Company Financial Statements reflect an adequate reserve for
all Taxes payable by the Company for all taxable periods and portions thereof
through the date of such financial statements. No material deficiency with
respect to any Taxes has been threatened, proposed, asserted or assessed against
the Company, and no waivers or extensions of the statute of limitations with

combined or unitary group and has no liability for the payment of Taxes of any
other entity as a result of being a member of such a group or as a result of any
express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person with respect to the
payment of any Taxes.

         (f) For purposes of this Agreement:

         "Taxes" includes all forms of taxation, whenever created or imposed,
and whether of the United States or elsewhere, and whether imposed by a local,
municipal, governmental, state, foreign, federal or other Governmental Entity,
or in connection with any agreement with respect to Taxes, including all
interest, penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts.

         "Tax Return" means any federal, state, local, provincial or foreign Tax
return, declaration, statement, report, schedule, form or information return or
any amended Tax return relating to Taxes.

         Section 3.09.     Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans and Agreements.

         There has not been any adoption or amendment in any material respect by
the Company of any collective bargaining agreement or any bonus, pension, profit
sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, supplemental income,
stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, phantom stock, retirement,
thrift, savings, stock bonus, restricted stock, cafeteria, severance, disability
or medical plan, which the Company maintains or contributes to, providing
benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company
(collectively, "Company Benefit Plans") since December 31, 2002 and, except as
required to comply with applicable Law or to fully vest employees in their
account balances under any Company Pension Plans. Schedule 3.09 of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a list of each employment, consulting,
indemnification, severance or termination agreement or arrangement, non-compete
agreement, confidentiality agreement, nonsolicitation and business diversion
agreement or tax gross-up agreement between the Company and any current or
former employee, officer or director of the Company for which the Company has
any obligation or liability (collectively, "Company Benefit Agreements") and,
except as required to comply with applicable Law, since December 31, 2002 there
has not been any adoption or amendment (in any material respect with


                                       12
<PAGE>
respect to items other than Company Benefit Agreements) of any Company Benefit
Agreement or any personnel policy, vacation policy or other arrangement,
program, practice or understanding providing Company benefits to any current or
former employee, officer or director.

         Section 3.10.     ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments.

         (a) Schedule 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list
of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"))
(sometimes referred to herein as "Company Pension Plans"), "employee welfare
benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other Company
Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements (i) for which the Company has any
obligation or liability and (ii) which the Company has maintained, or
contributed to, or to which the Company is a party, for the benefit of any
current or former employees, officers or directors of the Company, which has
been as maintained or contributed to by the Company within six years prior to
the Effective Time. The Company has made available to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement
including all amendments thereto (or, in the case of any unwritten Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, a description thereof), (ii) the most
recent annual report on Form 5500 filed with the Internal Revenue Service with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan (if any such report was required), (iii)
the most recent summary plan description for each Company Benefit Plan for which
such summary plan description is required, (iv) each trust agreement and group
annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan and (v) each employment
and consulting agreement to which the Company is a party or is bound.

         (b) Each Company Pension Plan has received a favorable opinion,
advisory, notification or determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
to the effect that such Company Pension Plan (and the underlying prototype or
model document) is qualified in form under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, and no such opinion, advisory, notification or
determination letter has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has
revocation been threatened, nor except as required to comply with applicable Law
or to the knowledge of the Company, has any such Company Pension Plan been
amended since the date of its most recent opinion, advisory, notification or
determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would
materially adversely affect its qualification. The Company has substantially
complied with all obligations, whether by operation of law or contract,
including reporting and disclosure requirements, relating to the Company Benefit
Plans or Company Benefit Agreements. There is no material pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation relating to the Company Benefit
Plans. There are no matters, to the knowledge of the Company, pending before the
Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan.

         (c) No Company Pension Plan that is a defined benefit plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA other than any Company Pension Plan that is a "multiemployer
plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Company
Multiemployer Pension Plan"), had, as of the respective last annual valuation
date for each such Company Pension Plan, any "unfunded benefit liabilities" (as
such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA), based on reasonable
actuarial assumptions that have been furnished to Parent by the actuary for such


                                       13
<PAGE>
Company Pension Plan, and there has been no material adverse change in the
financial condition of any Company Pension Plan since its last such annual
valuation date. Except for premiums due under Section 4007 of ERISA, no
liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has, in the six years
before the Effective Time, been or is expected to be incurred by the Company
with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated Company Pension Plan that is a
"single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA,
currently or formerly maintained by it, or the single-employer plan of any
entity which is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001(b)
of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"), which has been
maintained or contributed to by such ERISA Affiliate within six years prior to
the Effective Time (an "ERISA Affiliate Pension Plan"). None of the Company, any
officer of the Company or any of the Company Benefit Plans which are subject to
ERISA, including the Company Pension Plans, any trusts created thereunder, or,
to the knowledge of the Company, any trustee or administrator thereof, has
engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary
responsibility that subjects the Company or any officer of the Company to any
material tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975
or to any material liability under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA. In the six
years before the Effective Time, none of such Company Benefit Plans which are
single-employer plans and their corresponding trusts has been terminated, nor
has there been any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043
of ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan, and no notice of a reportable event will be
required to be filed in connection with the Merger. Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has incurred a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal"
(as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205, respectively, of ERISA)
during the last six years with respect to any Company Multiemployer Pension Plan
or any Multiemployer plan which has been maintained or contributed to by such
ERISA Affiliate within six years prior to the Effective Time. As to each Company
Multiemployer Pension Plan, Schedule 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter
accurately describes the withdrawal liability which would be owed by the Company
if the Company ceased contributing thereto as of the Effective Time. All
contributions and premiums which are due and payable under the terms of any
Company Benefit Plan and the provisions of the Code, ERISA and other applicable
law as of the date hereof have been timely made or have been reflected on the
most recent balance sheet of the Company furnished to Parent. Neither any
Company Pension Plan nor any ERISA Affiliate Pension Plan has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code), whether or not waived, and all contributions required by
Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code have been timely made thereto.

         (d) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan, (i) no such Company Benefit Plan is funded through a
"welfare benefit fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code),
(ii) each such Company Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (as such term
is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) complies substantially with the
applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code and (iii) each such
Company Benefit Plan (including any such Company Benefit Plan covering retirees
or other former employees) may be amended or terminated without material
liability to the Company on or at any time after the Effective Time. Except as
may be required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code, or applicable state health
continuation laws, the Company has no obligations for retiree health and life
benefits under any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.


                                       14
<PAGE>
         (e) The consummation of the Merger will not (x) entitle any employee,
officer or director of the Company to severance pay or an election to terminate
and receive severance pay, (y) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other
material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Benefit Plans or Company
Benefit Agreements or (z) result in any breach or violation of, or a default
under, any of the Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit Agreements.

         (f) Other than payments that may be made to the persons and in the
amounts listed in Schedule 3.10(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) any
amount or economic benefit that is received or owed (whether in cash or property
or the vesting of property) under any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit
Agreement or otherwise as a result of the Merger or, to the Company's knowledge,
any other event prior to the Effective Time (including upon, as a result of or
in connection with a termination of employment on or following the Effective
Time), by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) will not be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), and
(ii) no disqualified individual is entitled to receive any additional payment
from the Company or any other person under any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement or otherwise as a result of the Merger in the event that the
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code is imposed on such disqualified
individual.

         Section 3.11.     Litigation.

         There is no suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending against,
or to the knowledge of the Company threatened against, the Company or any of the
Company's properties or rights before any arbitrator, court or other
Governmental Entity that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no suits, claims,
actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, seeking to prevent, hinder, modify or challenge the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company is not subject to any
outstanding Judgment against the Company or naming the Company as a party that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.12.     Compliance With Applicable Laws.

         (a) The Company is, and the Company's operations have been conducted,
in compliance with all applicable Laws, except for such failures to comply as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has not received any written notice: (i) of any
administrative, civil or criminal investigation or audit (other than Tax or
government royalty audits) by any Governmental Entity relating to the Company or
(ii) during the past two years, from any Governmental Entity alleging that the
Company is not in compliance in any material respect with any applicable Law
that has not otherwise been cured to the satisfaction of such Governmental
Entity.

         (b) The Company has in full force and effect all approvals,
authorizations, certificates, filings, franchises, licenses, notices, permits,
exemptions, exceptions, registrations and rights of or with all Governmental
Entities ("Permits") necessary for the Company to own,


                                       15
<PAGE>
lease or otherwise hold and to operate the Company's properties and assets and
to carry on the Company's business and operations as now conducted, except for
the failure to have such Permits that, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There have occurred no
defaults under, or violations of, any such Permit, except for such defaults and
violations that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no
action, proceeding or investigation pending or to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, that could reasonably be expected to result in suspension,
revocation or cancellation of any Permits. The Merger, in and of itself, would
not cause the revocation or cancellation of any such Permit that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

         (c) This Section 3.12 does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes,
which are the subject of Section 3.08, or to environmental matters, which are
the subject of Section 3.13.

         Section 3.13.     Environmental Matters.

         Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, have not

statutes of limitation have been, in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws, (ii) the Company is not currently subject to an

judgments will be sought against the Company; (v) all Permits required of the
Company under applicable Environmental Laws for conducting its operations have
been obtained, the terms and conditions of all such Permits are being complied
with, and all such Permits are currently valid and in full force and effect;
(vi) to the knowledge of the Company, there have been no releases of Hazardous

operations of the Company at locations offsite the Company's properties; (vii)
to the knowledge of the Company, there has not been exposure of any person or
property to Hazardous Substances as a result of the Company's operations that
would reasonably be expected to form the basis for a claim for damages or
compensation; and (viii) the Company has provided to Parent and Sub all internal
and external environmental audits, studies, documents, and correspondence on
environmental matters, Hazardous Substances, and compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws relating to the Company's operations and properties that are
in the possession or control of the Company. "Environmental Claim" means any
claim, demand, action, suit, complaint, proceeding, directive, environmental

forming the basis of any violation or alleged violation of any Environmental Law

Effect, each Material Contract is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
with its terms and is in full force and effect, the Company is not in breach or

other party to any Material Contract is in breach or default thereunder.

         Section 3.15.     Labor and Employment Matters.

         (a) The Company has provided to Parent a true, correct and complete

         Section 3.16.     Brokers; Fees and Expenses.

         No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person, other
than Lehman Brothers Inc. and A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., the fees and expenses
of which will be paid by the Company, is entitled to any broker's, finder's,
financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Merger based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company

         Section 3.18.     Reserve Information.

         The underlying factual information provided to DeGolyer and MacNaughton
("D&M") by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with
their Reserve Report dated December 31, 2002 (the "Reserve Report"), to the
extent that it was relied upon by D&M in the preparation of its report on the
Company's proved reserves as of December 31, 2002, was, at the time of delivery,
true and correct in all material respects. The Company has no knowledge of any
material errors in such underlying factual information supplied to D&M for
purposes of preparing such report and the conclusions in such report are not in
any material way unreasonable when compared with the Company's own evaluation of
the properties included in such report as of December 31, 2002 taken as a whole.

D&M Reserve Report. Except for changes (including changes in commodity prices or
service costs) generally affecting the oil and gas industry and disposition of
oil and gas properties since the date thereof, there have been no changes in
respect of the oil and gas properties covered by the Reserve Report that,
individually or in the aggregate, have had or could reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect; provided further that changes in
evaluation methods, criteria or techniques used by Purchaser will not constitute
such a change. Set forth in Schedule 3.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter is a
list of all material oil and gas properties that were included in the Reserve

         Section 3.19      Intellectual Property.

         The Company and its Subsidiaries own or possess all necessary licenses
or other valid rights to use all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark
rights and proprietary information used or held for use in connection with their
respective businesses as currently being conducted, free and clear of material
Liens, except where the failure to own or possess such licenses and other rights
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and there are no assertions or claims challenging the validity of any of
the foregoing which would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except in the ordinary course of
business, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted to any
other person any license to use any of the foregoing. The conduct of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' respective businesses as currently conducted
does not conflict with any patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks,
trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights or copyrights of others in a
way which would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no infringement of any
proprietary right owned by or licensed by or to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in a way which would be reasonably expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.20      Related Party Transactions.

partner or shareholder (except holdings solely for passive investment purposes
of securities of publicly held and traded entities constituting less than 5% of
the equity of any such entity), (c) owes any money to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (d) has any interest in any property, real or personal, tangible

         (a) Except for property sold, used or otherwise disposed of since
December 31, 2002 in the ordinary course of business for fair value, the Company
has defensible title in respect of oil and gas properties, of a type and nature
customarily acceptable to the reasonably prudent oil


                                       20
<PAGE>
and gas operator of oil and gas interests for all oil and gas properties,
interests in properties and assets, real and personal, reflected in the
Company's December 31, 2002 financial statements, free and clear of any Lien,
except: (i) Liens securing the Company's Credit Facility and industrial revenue
bonds reflected in the balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2002;
(ii) Liens for current taxes not yet due and payable; (iii) statutory liens and
operator's liens incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with
the Company's oil and gas business; and (iv) such imperfections of title,
easements and Liens that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) All leases and other agreements pursuant to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries lease or otherwise acquire or obtain operating rights
affecting any real or personal property are in good standing, valid, and
effective, except where the failure to be in good standing, valid or effective
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect; and there is not, under any such leases, any default or event of default
or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would be reasonably expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All
significant operating equipment related to the wells and gathering systems owned
by the Company and its Subsidiaries is in good operating condition, ordinary
wear and tear excepted, except where the failure to maintain such operating
equipment in such condition would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has not received any material
advance, take-or-pay or other similar payments that entitle purchasers of
production to receive deliveries of hydrocarbons without paying therefor. Set
forth on Schedule 3.21(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter is a statement of the
Company's net overproduction, determined on a Company-wide basis.

         Section 3.22      Insurance.

         The Company and its Subsidiaries own and are beneficiaries under
insurance policies underwritten by reputable insurers that, as to risks insured,
coverages and related limits and deductibles, are customary in the industry in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate. All premiums due with respect to
all such insurance policies that are material have been paid and, to the
knowledge of the Company, all such policies are in full force and effect. There
is no material claim by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any
of the Company's insurance policies as to which coverage has been questioned,
denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice, which remains
outstanding, of cancellation or termination with respect to any material
insurance policy.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB

         Parent and Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

         Section 4.01.     Organization, Standing and Power.

         Each of Parent and Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized and has full corporate power


                                       21
<PAGE>
and authority necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its
properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted.

         Section 4.02.     Sub.

         Since the date of its incorporation, Sub has not carried on any
business or conducted any operations other than the execution of this Agreement,
the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto. Sub
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

         Section 4.03.     Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.

         Each of Parent and Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the Merger. The
execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and Sub of this Agreement
and the consummation by it of the Merger have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate and shareholder action on the part of Parent and Sub.
Parent, as sole shareholder of Sub, has adopted this Agreement and approved the
Merger. Each of Parent and Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement,
and this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligations,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as that
enforceability may be limited by any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditor's rights generally and the application of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law
or in equity). The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of common stock of Sub voting as a single class is the only
vote of any class or series of Sub's capital stock required to approve the
Merger and adopt this Agreement.

         Section 4.04.     No Conflicts; Consents.

         (a) The execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and Sub
of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and compliance with
the terms of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation
of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, any
provision of (i) the charter or organizational documents of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, (ii) other than the Parent's credit facility, any Contract to
which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their
respective properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject to the filings and
other matters referred to in Section 4.04(b), any Judgment or Law applicable to
Parent or any of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets,
except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such matters as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in Section 9.03).

         (b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or
notice to, or Permit from any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or
made by or with respect to Parent or any of its subsidiaries in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger, other than (i) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Texas, (ii) such filings as may be required
in connection with the Taxes described in Section 6.08, (iii) such filings as
may be required under federal or state securities Laws, and (iv) such other
items as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.05.     Financing.

         Parent will have as of the Closing Date (through cash on hand and
existing credit arrangements or otherwise) all of the funds necessary for the
payment of the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the
Merger, as and when required hereunder, and to perform its and Sub's obligations
under this Agreement. Parent has provided to the Company a true and complete
copy of the commitment letter from JP Morgan Chase Bank evidencing the
availability to Parent of the bridge facilities necessary to fund the aggregate
Merger Consideration, and such commitment letter shall remain effective through
the Closing, or, if it expires or is terminated prior to Closing, it shall be
promptly replaced with one or more substantially equivalent funding commitments
in favor of Parent sufficient to fund fully the aggregate Merger Consideration,
which shall remain effective through the Closing or be replaced by substantially
equivalent commitments. Parent shall promptly provide a true and complete copy
of all such replacement funding commitments, if any, to the Company.

         Section 4.06.     Litigation.

         There is no suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending against,
or to the knowledge of Parent threatened against or affecting, Parent or any of
its subsidiaries before any Governmental Entity that questions the validity of
this Agreement or any action to be taken by Parent or Sub in connection with the
consummation of the Merger or would otherwise prevent or delay the consummation
of the Merger.

         Section 4.07.     Ownership of Company Common Stock.

         As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries
beneficially owns any shares of Company Common Stock.

         Section 5.02.     No Solicitation.

         (a) From the date hereof, the Company shall not (whether directly or
indirectly through advisors, agents, representatives or other intermediaries),
and the Company shall not authorize or permit its officers, directors, advisors,
representatives and other agents (collectively, its "Representatives") to,
directly or indirectly, (i) continue any discussions or negotiations, if any,
with any persons, other than Parent and Sub, conducted heretofore with respect
to any Company Takeover Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiries relating to, or the submission of,
any Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Company Takeover Proposal, (iv) furnish to any person

fide Company Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof which was not
solicited, encouraged or facilitated after the date hereof in breach of this
Section 5.02 or did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.02, at
any time prior to the Company Shareholder Approval being obtained, furnish
information to, negotiate with or otherwise engage in discussions with any
person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal provided that (i) a majority
of the entire Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its independent financial advisors and upon written advice of its outside legal
counsel, that (A) such Company Takeover Proposal provides for a payment or value
to the Company's shareholders which is greater than the Merger Consideration and
is otherwise reasonably expected to result in (in all cases taking into account
any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Merger
offered in writing by Parent in response to such Company Takeover Proposal) a
Superior


                                       26
<PAGE>
Company Proposal and (B) such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law, and (ii) no
disclosure of any information shall be made to such person prior to entering
into a confidentiality agreement containing provisions substantially identical
to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section
6.02(b)) and no negotiations or discussions shall commence or information be
provided to any such person until 72 hours after the Company shall have advised
Parent of its intention to do so and provided Parent with a copy of (or an
accurate and complete description of all material terms of ) such proposal. The
Company shall as promptly as possible (but in no case later than 24 hours after
actual receipt by a director or officer of the Company) provide Parent with a
copy of any written Company Takeover Proposal received and a written statement
with respect to any non-written Company Takeover Proposal received or any
inquiries or requests for information related to a Company Takeover Proposal,
which statement shall include the material terms thereof and the identity of the
person making the Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent fully
informed on a reasonably current basis of any proposals, inquiries or material
developments with respect to any proposals, inquiries or discussions. Any
information provided to Parent by the Company under this subsection (a) shall be
maintained confidential in the same manner as other information furnished by the
Company pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement. If the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their representatives receives a request for information
from a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal involving the Company and the Company is permitted to provide such
person with information, the Company will provide to Parent a copy of the
confidentiality agreement with such person promptly upon its execution and
provide to the Parent a list of, and copies of, the information provided to such
person concurrently with its delivery to such person and promptly provide Parent
with access to all information to which such person was provided access, in each
case only to the extent not previously provided to the Parent.

         (b) Nothing contained in Section 5.02(a) shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from making any disclosure to the Company's shareholders
required by applicable Law.

         (c) For purposes of this Agreement:

         "Company Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer (other than by
Parent, Sub or any of their affiliates) for or any public announcement of an
intention to complete (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution,
recapitalization, liquidation or other business combination involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the acquisition in any manner, directly
or indirectly, of beneficial ownership of a number of shares of any class of
equity securities of the Company (other than a change in ownership of Union Oil
Company of California) equal to or greater than 15% of the number of such shares
outstanding before such acquisition, or (iii) the acquisition (including any
lease, long-term supply agreement, mortgage, pledge or other arrangement having
similar economic effect) in any manner, directly or indirectly, of any business
or assets that generate 15% or more of the Company's consolidated net revenues
or net income or constitute more than 15% of the Company's assets, in each case
other than the Merger and whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions.

         "Superior Company Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal made
by a third party (other than by Parent, Sub or any of their affiliates) to
acquire directly or indirectly (i) all the equity securities or (ii) all or
substantially all assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, whether by merger,
consolidation, share exchange, dissolution, recapitalization, liquidation or


                                       27
<PAGE>
otherwise, if the Company Board determines in good faith by a vote of a majority
of its members (based on, among other things, the written advice of its
independent financial advisors and outside counsel), taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person
making such proposal, that such proposal (x) would, if consummated in accordance
with its terms, be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger (taking into account any
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Merger offered
in writing by Parent) and (y) is reasonably likely to be consummated without
undue delay.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         Section 6.01.     Shareholders Meeting.

         (a) The Company shall take all action in accordance with the Company
Charter, Company Bylaws and applicable Laws necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a special meeting of its shareholders (the "Company
Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder
Approval of this Agreement and the Merger at the earliest practicable date and
in any event before June 16, 2003. The Company Board shall recommend to
shareholders of the Company that they give the Company Shareholder Approval and
the Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts (including the
solicitation of proxies) to solicit and obtain such approval; provided, however,
that, the Company Board shall be permitted to modify or withdraw its
recommendation (but not its approval) and to not recommend a vote for the Merger
or to advise against voting for the Merger (each a "Change in Recommendation")
in each case in a manner adverse to Parent and in such case not solicit votes in
favor of approval if after the date of this Agreement the Company has received a
Superior Company Proposal and a majority of the full Company Board determines in
good faith, after receipt of written advice from its outside legal counsel, that
such action is necessary for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law, but only after the
third business day following Parent's receipt of written notice that the Company
Board is prepared to withdraw or modify its recommendation. Unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the obligation of the
Company Board to cause this Agreement and the Merger to be submitted to the
Company's shareholders for approval at the Company Shareholders Meeting will not
be limited or affected by any Change in Recommendation; provided that if there
has been a Change in Recommendation in accordance with this Section 6.01, the
Company Board may submit the Merger and this Agreement, "without
recommendation," in accordance with Article 5.03 of the TBCA. Unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the Company Board will
not, in connection with any Change in Recommendation, take any action to
withdraw the approval of the Company Board of this Agreement or the Merger,
including for purposes of causing the Company Rights Agreement, Part 13 of the
TBCA or any state takeover statute or state law that purports to limit or
restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares to be
inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and the Support Agreements. As promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare solicitation
materials for the Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in preparation of such solicitation materials. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to review and comment on the
solicitation materials


                                       28
<PAGE>
and any amendments or supplements thereto prior to them being sent or
distributed to the Company's shareholders. Subject to the foregoing, as promptly
as practicable, and in any event before May 25, 2003, the Company shall mail a
notice of special meeting and solicitation materials (including proxies) to its
shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Company Shareholders
Meeting.

         (b) The information supplied by the Company in the solicitation
materials sent to the shareholders of the Company in connection with the Company
Shareholders Meeting shall not, at the date such materials (or any supplement
thereto) are first mailed to such shareholders, at the time of the Company
Shareholders Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or affiliates, should be discovered by the Company that should
be set forth in a supplement to the solicitation materials, the Company shall
promptly inform Purchaser and promptly supplement such material.

         (c) The information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the
solicitation materials to be sent to the shareholders of the Company in
connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not, at the date the
solicitation materials (or any supplement thereto) is first mailed to such
shareholders, at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting or at the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or
circumstance relating to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates should
be discovered by Parent that should be set forth in a supplement to the
solicitation materials, Parent shall promptly inform the Company.

         Section 6.02.     Access to Information; Confidentiality.

         (a) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i) afford to
Parent, and to Parent's officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives, access during reasonable business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time to (x) all of the Company's
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and other
information and business documents, (y) by appointment, the Company's
independent reserve engineers and accountants and (z) the premises and
facilities of the Company, provided that access to the premises and facilities
shall be permitted only at times and upon conditions reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company (consent by the Company not to be unreasonably withheld),
and (ii) promptly furnish such information as may be reasonably requested from
time to time by Parent or its representatives. During the period prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall not contact any of the Company's customers, working
interest owners, contractors, lenders, lessors, parties to contracts with the
Company and suppliers, except at such times and upon such conditions as may be
reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Parent, and Company's agreement shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall have the right to have
representatives present at all times of any such inspections, interviews and
communications conducted by Parent or its representatives.

         (b) Neither any investigation conducted by Parent or its
representatives pursuant to this Section 6.02 or otherwise nor the results
thereof shall affect any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement or the ability of Parent to rely thereon. All information
exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality
agreement dated February 17, 2003, between the Company and Parent (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

         Section 6.03.     Commercially Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification.

         (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including (i) determining whether
any action by or in respect of or filing with any Governmental Entities is
required or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from third parties in connection with the Merger, (ii) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining
of all necessary, proper or advisable consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties, (iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (v)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

         (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or Sub to agree to,
or permit the Company to agree to, the imposition of conditions, the payment of
any material amounts or any requirement of divestiture to obtain any approval or
consent, and in no event shall any party take, or be required to take, any
action that would or could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

         (c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Sub
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or warranty
made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate or any
event or condition that could reasonably be expected to cause any representation
or warranty made by it not to be true and correct at the Effective Time, (ii)
the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, (iii) any notice or other communication it receives from any
person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger, (iv) any notice or other communication it receives
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, or (v) any action,
suit, claim, investigation or proceeding commenced or, to its knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting it that, if
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.11 or 4.07, as applicable, or that relate to the
consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that no


                                       30
<PAGE>
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

         Section 6.04.     Stock Options.

         (a) At the Effective Time, each holder (an "Optionholder") of a then
outstanding Company Stock Option (whether or not vested or exercisable) shall be
entitled to receive from the Company, in cancellation of such Company Stock
Option, for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option, an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise
price of such Company Stock Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to
as, the "Option Consideration"). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain an option cancellation
agreement (in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) executed by each such
Optionholder that requires the cancellation of the Company Stock Options of such
Optionholder in exchange for receipt by the Optionholder of the Option
Consideration ("Option Cancellation Agreement")(or a written release of the
Optionholder's rights under any Company Stock Option in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent).

         (b) All amounts payable to each Optionholder pursuant to this Section
6.04 shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid as
soon as practicable, but in any event within seven (7) days, following the later
of the Effective Time and delivery by the Optionholder of his or her executed
Option Cancellation Agreement (or a written release of the Optionholder's rights
under any Company Stock Options in form reasonably satisfactory to the Parent)
without interest. The cancellation of a Company Stock Option in exchange for the
cash payment described in this Section 6.04 shall be deemed a release of any and
all rights the holder had or may have had in respect thereof.

         (c) In this Agreement:

         "Company Stock Option" means any option to purchase Company Common
Stock granted under any of the Company Stock Plans.

         "Company Stock Plans" means the Company's (i) 1998 Omnibus Stock and
Incentive Plan, as amended, (ii) Non-Statutory Director Stock Option Plan, as
amended, and (iii) 1987 Incentive Stock Option Plan, as amended.

         (d) To the extent that Parent, at Parent's sole option, directs the
Company prior to the Effective Time to terminate the Matador Petroleum
Corporation 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and in sufficient time to provide any
required advance notices to participants in such plan with respect to such
termination, the Company shall terminate such plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time in the manner reasonably requested by Parent; provided, however,
the Company shall not be required to prepare or make any filings with the
Internal Revenue Service in connection with such termination prior to the
Effective Time.


                                       31

         Section 6.05.     Indemnification.

         (a) After the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof, a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and,
collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") with respect to any liability, loss,
damage, judgment, fine, penalty, amount paid in settlement or compromise with
the approval of the Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), cost or expense (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel) incurred in connection with any threatened or actual action, suit or
proceeding based on, or arising out of, the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("Indemnified
Liabilities"), in each case, to the full extent that the Surviving Corporation
is permitted under applicable Texas Law to so indemnify. Any Indemnified Party
desiring to claim indemnification under this Section 6.05(a), upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have under this
Section 6.05(a) except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such
indemnifying party). After the Surviving Corporation's receipt of such notice
with respect to any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume and direct all aspects of
the defense thereof, including settlement, and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in the vigorous defense of any such matter. In no event shall Parent
or the Surviving Corporation be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent. If any determination that an Indemnified Party's conduct
complies with the standards set forth in the TBCA is required to be made, such
determination shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party; and provided, further, that
nothing herein shall impair any rights or obligations of any Indemnified Party.
The Surviving Corporation shall promptly advance all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of each Indemnified Party in connection with any such action, suit or
proceedings described above, as such expenses are incurred, to the fullest
extent permitted by the TBCA, subject to the receipt by the Surviving
Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified by the Surviving Corporation. The rights to
indemnification under this Section 6.05(a) shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided, however,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Indemnified Liabilities
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition
of such Indemnified Liabilities.

         (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained, to the extent such coverage is then reasonably
available, policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance providing
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time that is
substantially equal to the coverage provided under the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies existing on the date of the Agreement
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall this covenant require
annual expenditures of more than 150% of the last annual premiums paid prior to
the date hereof by the Company for such insurance.


                                       32
<PAGE>
         (c) Parent shall assume by written instrument delivered at the Closing
each indemnification agreement between the Company and any of its former and
existing officers and directors which was in force and effect immediately prior
to the date of this Agreement and is listed on Schedule 3.14 of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

         (d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.05.

         (e) The provisions of this Section 6.05 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and to be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise. Parent agrees to pay all expenses (including
fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
successfully enforcing the indemnity or other obligations under this Section
6.05.

         Section 6.06.     Fees and Expenses.

         (a) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger and this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

         (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.01(d) (superior proposal), (ii) by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.01(c)(i) (change in recommendation) or (iii) by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) (failure to obtain Company Shareholder
Approval) after a Change in Recommendation, then the Company shall promptly, but
in no event later than the date of such termination (or one business day after
such termination if terminated by Parent), pay to Parent a fee equal to $20.0
million (the "Termination Fee"), by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by Parent, which shall be deemed to be sole and exclusive
remedy and liquidated damages payable to Parent for such termination because
Parent's actual damages would be difficult to ascertain.

         (c) In the event there has not been a Change in Recommendation prior to
the Company Shareholder Meeting and this Agreement is terminated by Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) (failure to obtain Company
Shareholder Approval) or Section 8.01(b)(ii) (expiration date of this Agreement)
and (x) within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such termination,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into an agreement for or
consummates a transaction that constitutes a Company Takeover Proposal, or (y)
after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, there shall have
been made a Company Takeover Proposal or any proposal or expression of interest
by a third party regarding a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been disclosed
publicly or generally to the Company's shareholders and within twelve (12)
months of the date of such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into any agreement for or consummates a transaction that constitutes a
Company Takeover Proposal with the person (or one of its affiliates) who made
(or expressed interest in) a Company Takeover Proposal as described in this
clause (y), then in either case the


                                       33
<PAGE>
Company will prior to the earlier of consummation of a transaction that
constitutes a Company Takeover Proposal or execution of a definitive agreement
with respect thereto, pay to Parent an amount equal to the Termination Fee less
any amount previously paid to Parent pursuant to Section 6.06(d), by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, which shall be
deemed to be the sole and exclusive remedy and liquidated damages payable to
Parent for such termination because Parent's actual damages would be difficult
to ascertain.

         (d) In the event there has not been a Change in Recommendation prior to
the Company Shareholder Meeting and this Agreement is terminated by Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) (failure to obtain Company
Shareholder Approval) and after the date hereof and prior to such termination
there shall not have been made a Company Takeover Proposal and no proposal or
expression of interest by a third party regarding a Company Takeover Proposal
shall have been disclosed publicly or generally to the Company's shareholders,
then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than the date of such
termination (or one business day after such termination if terminated by
Parent), pay to Parent $4.0 million as payment in full of Parent's estimated
expenses, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent.

         Section 6.07.     Public Announcements.

         Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or otherwise making
any such public statements with respect to the Merger and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except after reasonable attempts to provide notice have been undertaken and if
such release or statement is required by applicable Law.

         Section 6.08.     Transfer Taxes.

         All stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording
and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any such
Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid
by the party upon whom the primary burden is placed by the applicable Law. Each
party shall cooperate with the other in preparing, executing and filing any Tax
Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes, including supplying in a timely
manner a complete list of all real property interests held by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and any information with respect to such property that is
reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Returns.

         Section 6.09.     Support Agreements.

         Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, each of the
shareholders of the Company listed in Schedule 6.09 of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall execute and deliver a Voting and Support Agreement (collectively,
the "Support Agreements"), which shall become effective as of the date hereof.

         Section 6.10.     Tax Certificates.

         On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) use commercially
reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent a certificate of non-foreign status
for each Company shareholder which meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1445-2(b)(2), or (ii) provide to Parent a certification by the Company
with respect to the shares of the Company which meets the requirements of

Closing Date.

         Section 6.11.     Further Assurances.

         At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Company or Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Sub,
any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger.

time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of matters
presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the Company:

         (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

         (b) by either Parent or the Company:

                  (i) if a statute, rule or executive order shall have been
enacted, entered or promulgated prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or if any Governmental Entity shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling or takes any other action permanently
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger or
the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have

                  (ii) if the Merger shall not have been consummated within 120
days after the date hereof (or such later date to which Parent and the Company
may have extended the Closing deadline); provided, however, that a party may not
terminate pursuant to this clause (b)(ii) if the terminating party shall have
breached in any material respect its obligations under this


                                       37
<PAGE>
Agreement in any manner that shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the
occurrence of the failure referred to in this clause; or

                  (iii) if the Company Shareholder Approval is not obtained upon
a vote at a duly held meeting of the shareholders of the Company held for that

                  (iii) if (A) there shall be a breach of any representation or
warranty of the Company in this Agreement or any representation or warranty of
the Company in this Agreement shall have become untrue, or (B) there shall be a
breach by the Company of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, in either case only if the condition in Section 7.02(a) would be
incapable of being satisfied as a result and in the case of such a breach or
untruth described in clause (A) above, either is not capable of being cured or,
if it is capable of being cured, has not been cured within thirty (30) days
following written notice to the Company from Parent or Sub of such breach; or

                  (iv) if any shareholder shall have (A) failed to vote for the
Merger as required by a Support Agreement or (B) breached any of its other
obligations under a Support Agreement if such breach either is not capable of
being cured or, if it is capable of being cured, has not been cured within three
(3) days following notice to the Company from Parent or Sub of such breach.

         (d) by the Company if prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval (A) the Company Board, by majority vote of the entire Company Board,
determines in good faith, based upon (among other things) the written advice of
outside counsel to the Company, with respect to a Superior Company Proposal
received after the date hereof that was not solicited or encouraged in violation
of Section 5.02 of this Agreement, that acceptance of such Superior Company
Proposal is necessary to comply with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
under applicable Law, (B) the Company, at the direction of the Company Board,
notifies Parent in writing that it intends to terminate this Agreement and enter
into an agreement with respect to such Superior Company Proposal, which
notification identifies the person making the Superior Company Proposal and
attaches the most current version of all proposed agreements related thereto (or
a complete and accurate description of all material terms and conditions
thereof), (C) Parent does not make, within three (3) full business days of
receipt of the Company's written notification of its intention to enter into a
binding agreement for a Superior Company Proposal, an offer that the Company
Board, by majority vote of the entire Company Board, determines in good faith
after consultation with its financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the
shareholders of the Company as such Superior Company Proposal, it being
understood that the Company shall not enter into any binding agreement with
respect to such Superior Company Proposal during such three-business day period
(which period shall be extended for one (1) business day after the


                                       38
<PAGE>
Company notifies Parent of any material change in the terms of such Superior
Company Proposal that occurs after the initial notification to Parent), (D)
prior to such termination, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and
legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to
proceed with the transactions contemplated herein and (E) the Company
concurrently with termination pursuant to this clause (d) pays to Parent the
Termination Fee (as provided in Section 6.06(b)). The Company agrees to notify
Parent promptly of any material change in such proposal or if its intention to
enter into a written agreement referred to in its notification shall change at
any time after giving such notification; or

         (e) by the Company prior to the Effective Time, if (A) there shall be a
breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Sub in this Agreement or
any representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement shall become
untrue, or (B) there shall be a breach by Parent or Sub of any of its covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, in either case only if the condition

capable of being cured or, if it is capable of being cured, has not been cured
within thirty (30) days following written notice to Parent from the Company of
such breach.

         Section 8.02.     Effect of Termination.

         (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company
or Parent or Sub as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part
of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than Section 6.06, this Section 8.02 and
Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination, and except that
nothing in this Section 8.02 shall relieve a party from liability for fraud, the
breach of such party's covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or
the willful breach by a party of any representation or warranty set forth in
this Agreement and such party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities
and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result thereof, except
as otherwise provided in Section 6.06. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination.

         (b) In the event of termination of this Agreement other than pursuant

Hedge Contracts (as defined below) to which Parent or any of its affiliates is a
party will be transferred and assigned to the Company or, at the Company's
election, to the Bank of Oklahoma as the Company's designee and the Company
agrees to fully assume or, at the Company's election, cause Bank of Oklahoma as
its designee to assume such contracts. For purposes of this Section 8.02(b), the
Hedge Contracts are the contracts described on Exhibit 8.02 hereto and in the
volumes shown thereon. The Hedge Contracts may be entered into by Parent
promptly after execution of this Agreement. To the extent that the Company
enters into any portion of the Hedge Contracts within 24 hours after execution
of this Agreement at prices and on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent, then
the Company shall not be required to assume such amount of Hedge Contracts from
Parent. Any costs or expenses incurred by Parent or its affiliates to enter into
or put in place the Hedge Contracts shall be borne by Parent or its affiliates.
Any costs or expenses incurred in connection with the assumption or transfer of
the Hedge Contracts by or to the Company or its designee shall be borne by the
Company or its affiliates.

         Section 8.03.     Amendment.

         This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified by the parties
at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval only by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of the parties; provided, however, that after receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment, supplement or
modification that by Law requires further approval by the shareholders of the
Company without such further approval of such shareholders.

         Section 8.04.     Extension; Waiver.

         At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party (a) may extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other

another party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 8.03, may waive
compliance with any of the agreements of another party or any conditions to its
own obligations contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure or delay of
any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not impair such right or constitute a waiver of, or the
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement herein, and any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. Except as set
forth in Sections 6.06 and 8.02, all rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

         Section 8.05.     Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or
                           Waiver.

         A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment,
modification or supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an
extension or waiver pursuant to Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective,
require in the case of Parent, Sub or the Company, action by its Board of
Directors or the duly authorized designee of its Board of Directors.

instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective

         Section 9.04.     Interpretation.

         When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section or an Article,
such reference shall be to a Section or Article of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation."

         Section 9.05.     Severability.

         If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the Merger is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

         Section 9.06.     Counterparts.

         This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties.

         Section 9.07.     Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

         Except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which continues in full force
and effect, this Agreement, taken together with the Company Disclosure Letter,
(a) constitutes the entire agreement of, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among, the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated by, and the subject matter of, this Agreement and (b)
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure solely to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective permitted successors, except
for the provisions of Section 2.02 and Section 6.05 which may be also enforced
by the persons intended to be benefited thereby. The Company agrees that nothing
contained in this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be
deemed to violate the Confidentiality Agreement.

         Section 9.08.     Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.

         This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Texas, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Each party to
this Agreement submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in Dallas County, Texas in any dispute or action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute
or action may be heard and determined in any such court. Each party also agrees
not to bring any dispute or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement
in any other court. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any dispute or
action so brought will be conclusive and may be enforced in any


                                       43
<PAGE>
other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or any other manner provided at Law
(common, statutory or other) or in equity. Each party waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any dispute or action so brought. Each
of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to service of any summons and
complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding relating to
the Merger, on behalf of itself or its property, by personal delivery of such
summons, complaint or process to such party. Nothing in this Section 9.08 shall
affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

         Section 9.09.     Attorneys' Fees.

         If any action at Law or equity, including an action for declaratory
relief, is brought to enforce or interpret any provision of this Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses from the other party, which fees and expenses shall be in addition to
any other relief which may be awarded.

         Section 9.10.     Company Disclosure Letter.

         The disclosures made on the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to
any representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made with respect to any
other representation or warranty requiring the same or similar disclosure to the
extent that the relevance of such disclosure to other representations and
warranties is reasonably evident from the face of the disclosure schedule. The
inclusion of any matter on any disclosure schedule will not be deemed an
admission by any party that such listed matter is material or that such listed
matter has or would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 9.11.     Assignment.

         Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law
or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the
other parties. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.

         Section 9.12.     Limitations on Warranties.

         (a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and any agreements or certificates
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the Company makes no other express or
implied representation or warranty to Parent or Sub. Parent and Sub each
acknowledge that, in entering into this Agreement, it has not relied on any
representations or warranties of the Company other than the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Letter or any agreements or certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

         (b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and any agreements or certificates delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent and Sub make no other express or implied representation or
warranty to the Company. The Company acknowledges that, in entering into this
Agreement, it has not relied on any representations or warranties of Parent and
Sub other than the representations and warranties of Parent and Sub set forth in
this Agreement or any agreements or certificates delivered pursuant to this
Agreement.

         Section 9.13.     Specific Performance.

         The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party
to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take
all actions as are necessary on its part to the consummation of the Merger, will
cause irreparable injury to the other parties for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby
consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction to compel performance of such party's obligations and to the
granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations
hereunder.

         Section 9.14.     Waiver of Trial by Jury.

         EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
