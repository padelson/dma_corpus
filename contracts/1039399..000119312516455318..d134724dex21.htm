ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01 _. The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary
shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Oregon Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease,
and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation").

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place in Menlo Park at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 1600 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, California 94025 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.
The date upon which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing
Date."

(c) On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file
articles of merger with the Oregon Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Oregon Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the
articles of merger are duly filed with the Oregon Secretary of State (or at
such later time as may be specified in the articles of merger).

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of
the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Oregon Law.

 

 __Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time: __

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.02, each share of Company
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive (i) 0.6534 (as may be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 2.02(a), the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Parent Stock (unless the
Aggregate Shares Issued would exceed the Maximum Share Number, in which case
the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced (the amount of such reduction, the
"Exchange Ratio Reduction Number") to the minimum extent necessary (as
determined by Parent) such that the Aggregate Shares Issued equals the
Maximum Share Number) (the "Per Share Stock Consideration"), and (ii) $16.00
in cash, without interest, _plus_ , solely if the Exchange Ratio is adjusted
pursuant to the preceding clause (i), the amount in cash equal to the
Exchange Ratio Reduction Number multiplied by the Parent Stock Closing Price
(the total cash per share of Common Stock to be paid pursuant to this clause
(ii), the "Per Share Cash Consideration", and, together with the Per Share
Stock Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter represent

 



8  only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right to receive
any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(f), in each case
to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock (other
than shares in a Company Employee Plan) or owned by Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

 

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each
such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

__Section 2.03 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent (the " __Exchange Agent __") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares
of Company Stock (the " __Certificates __") or (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Stock (the " __Uncertificated Shares __"). On or prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration
to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event no later than
five Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall send, or shall
cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock
at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of
the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. __

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The shares of
Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at Parents
option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical
certificate is requested by a holder of shares of Company Stock or is
otherwise required under Applicable Law. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(f).

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of
Company Stock 12 months after the Effective Time shall be

  



9  returned to Parent upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.03(f), in respect of such shares without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company
Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent
constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 2.06, shall be paid to the holder of
any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered
or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section. Following
such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest and in
addition to the applicable amount payable pursuant to this Article 2, to the
Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, (i) at the
time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section
2.06 and the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such
surrender with respect to such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a
payment date subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such
securities.

__Section 2.04 _. Stock Options; Restricted Stock Units._ (a) At
the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or that
vests as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
(each, a " __Cancelled Option __") shall, by virtue of the Merger and
effective at the Effective Time, be cancelled and terminated and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to
each share of Company Stock underlying such Cancelled Option, equal to the
excess, if any, of the Closing Date Merger Consideration Value over the per
share exercise price of such Cancelled Option (such amount being hereinafter
referred to as the " __Cancelled Option Consideration __"). The holder of
each Cancelled Option shall, with respect to each share of Company Stock
underlying such Cancelled Option, receive as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than earlier of the fifth Business Day
after the Closing Date and the Surviving Corporation s first full payroll
after the Effective Time) from the Surviving Corporation, an amount in cash
equal to the Cancelled Option Consideration. If the exercise price per share
of any such Cancelled Option is equal to or greater than the Closing Date
Merger Consideration Value, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.  __

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) that
is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(and does not vest as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), and that is held by a continuing service provider, shall
be assumed by Parent (each, an "Assumed Option"). Each such Assumed Option
shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to
the related Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the vesting schedule applicable thereto, except as set forth in the
remainder of this Section 2.04(b). The number of shares of Parent Stock
subject to each Assumed Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the number
of shares of Company Stock underlying such unvested Assumed Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Assumed Award
Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole
share). The per share exercise price of each Assumed Option shall be equal to
the quotient determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share at which
such Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(y) the Assumed Award Exchange Ratio (with the resulting price per share
rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The assumption of Assumed Options
pursuant to this Section shall

 



10  be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and
424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and
this Section shall be construed consistent with this intent.

(c) At the Effective Time, each award of Company Restricted Stock Units (or
portion thereof) that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or that vests as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) (each, a "Cancelled RSU") shall, by virtue
of the Merger and at the direction of Parent (which is hereby given pursuant
to this Agreement), be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share of
Company Stock underlying such Cancelled RSU, equal to the Closing Date Merger
Consideration Value (the "Cancelled RSU Consideration"). The holder of each
Cancelled RSU shall, with respect to each share of Company Stock underlying
such Cancelled RSU, receive as soon as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than the earlier of the fifth Business Day after the
Closing Date and the Surviving Corporations first full payroll after the
Effective Time) from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the
Cancelled RSU Consideration.

(d) At the Effective Time, each award of Company Restricted Stock Units (or
portion thereof) that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time (and does not vest as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) and that is held by a continuing service
provider shall, by virtue of the Merger, be assumed by Parent (each, an
"Assumed RSU"). The number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each Assumed
RSU shall be equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock
underlying such unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Assumed Award
Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole
share). Except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of such Assumed
RSUs, such Assumed RSUs will be subject to substantially the same terms and
conditions as applied to the related award of Company Restricted Stock Units
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same vesting schedule
applicable thereto.

(e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.04 under all Company Plans and Company
Compensatory Awards or any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including
delivering all required notices, obtaining all necessary consents, and
obtaining any required determinations and/or resolutions of the Companys
Board of Directors or a committee thereof.

(f) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of
the Assumed Options and the Assumed RSUs pursuant to this Section 2.04,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04.
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC, within 15 Business Days after the
Closing Date, a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-
effective amendment to a registration statement on an appropriate form
previously filed under the 1933 Act, with respect to the shares of Parent
Stock subject to the Assumed Options and the Assumed RSUs and, where
applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such registration
statement declared effective as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
covering such Assumed Options and the Assumed RSUs (and to maintain the
current status of any prospectus contained therein) for so long as such
Assumed Options and the Assumed RSUs remain outstanding.

__Section 2.05 _. Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur by reason of any
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, or other like change or event, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement,
the Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Cash Consideration, and the share amount
specified in Section 6.01(c)(i)(C) shall be appropriately adjusted, as
applicable. __

__Section 2.06 _. Fractional Shares._ No fractional shares of Parent Stock
shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a
holder of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive __

 



11 _ _ as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share
results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in
lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying
the Parent Stock Closing Price by the fraction of a share of Parent Stock to
which such holder would otherwise have been entitled. __

 

Section 2.07 _. Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law (provided,
however, that such withholding amounts shall be calculated in a consistent
manner with withholding calculations of the Company with respect to such
Persons immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law). If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be, so withholds amounts and remits such amounts to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Stock in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

__Section 2.08 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2. __

ARTICLE 3

 

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

 

 __Section 3.01 _. Articles of Incorporation._ The articles of incorporation
of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
Applicable Law; _provided_ that, at the Effective Time, such articles of
incorporation shall be amended and restated in the form set forth in
Exhibit A. __

__Section 3.02 _. Bylaws._ The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended
in accordance with Applicable Law. __

__Section 3.03 _. Directors and Officers. _ From and after the Effective
Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in
accordance with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii)
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation. __

 

ARTICLE 4

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Subject to Section 11.05, except as disclosed in any Company SEC Document
filed after December 31, 2014 and before the date of this Agreement or as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants
to Parent that:

 

 __Section 4.01 _. Corporate Existence and Power._ The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing under the laws of the State
of Oregon and has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business as now conducted, except for _ _

 



12 _ _ those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the
absence of which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be
so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent true and complete copies of the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company as currently in effect. __

 

 __Section 4.02 _. Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Companys
shareholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Stock is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys
capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger
(the " __Company Shareholder Approval __"). This Agreement constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors  rights generally and general principles of equity). __

 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys Board of Directors has
(i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Companys
shareholders, (ii) unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) unanimously
resolved, subject to Section 6.04(b), to recommend approval and adoption of
this Agreement by its shareholders (such recommendation, the "Company Board
Recommendation").

 

 __Section 4.03 _. Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the
filing of articles of merger with respect to the Merger with the

disclose information to the extent such disclosure (A) may result in a waiver
or impairment of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar
privilege or (B) may violate any confidentiality obligation of such party

reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements to provide such disclosure
in a way that does not result in the waiver or impairment of such privilege or

 __Section 6.03 _. Company Shareholder Meeting._ The Company shall cause a
meeting of its shareholders (the " __Company Shareholder Meeting __") to be

best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, (iii) not effect an

__Section 6.04 _. No Solicitation; Other Offers._ (a) _General
Prohibitions_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor
shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or
their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors (" __Representatives
__") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to
facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, __

 



30 _ _ furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in
any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any
effort by any Third Party that is __seeking to make, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation, fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, recommend an Acquisition
Proposal or fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal within five
Business Days after it is made public, or make any public statement that is
inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation, or publicly propose to do
any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), (iv) fail to enforce or grant any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of
equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) approve any
transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested shareholder" under,
ORS 60.825 to 0.845 or cause the Oregon Control Share Act to become applicable
to the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (vi) enter
into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument
relating to an Acquisition Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section by any Representative
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section by
the Company. __

(b)  _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a), at any time prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders:

 

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third
Party and its Representatives that, subject to the Companys compliance with
Section 6.04(a), has made after the date of this Agreement a Superior Proposal
or a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of
the Company reasonably believes will lead to a Superior Proposal and (B)
furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement (that includes standstill obligations) (a copy of
which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent) with such
Third Party with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained
in the Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement (including the standstill obligations)
dated March 10, 2015 between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"); _provided_ that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such Third Party) and (C) take any nonappealable, final action that any court
of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take; and

 

(ii) subject to compliance with Section 6.04(d), the Board of Directors of the
Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of a
Superior Proposal or (B) in response to an Intervening Event.

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would constitute
a breach of its fiduciary duties under Oregon Law.

__In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
of the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the
1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or
statement made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.04; _provided_
that any such action taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition
Proposal, other than a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act, shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of the
Company reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in
connection with such action. __

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take
any of the actions referred to in Section 6.04 unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it

 



31  intends to take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company
shall continue to advise Parent on a current basis of the status and material
terms of any discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition,
the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours)
after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a Third Party is considering making
an Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the
Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a current basis, of the status and material details of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and shall promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all
correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal (as well as written summaries of any oral communications addressing
such matters). Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be
deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Companys
compliance with this Section 6.04(c).

 

(d) " _Last Look_ ". Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal
(or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)) unless (i) the
Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least five Business Days
before taking that action, of its intention to do so, attaching (A) in the
case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a
Superior Proposal, the most current version of the proposed agreement under
which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of
the third party making the Acquisition Proposal, or (B) in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, a
reasonably detailed description of the reasons for making such Adverse
Recommendation Change, and (ii) Parent does not make, within five Business
Days after its receipt of that written notification, an offer that (A) in the
case of any Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a
Superior Proposal, is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the
Company as such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company and a new
three Business Day period under this Section 6.04(d)) or (B) in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event,
obviates the need for such recommendation change.

 

(e) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock or
all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and
taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation, are more favorable and provide greater value to
all the Companys shareholders than as provided hereunder (taking into account
any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.04(d)), which the Board of Directors of the Company determines is
reasonably likely to be consummated without undue delay relative to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for which financing, if a
cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or
reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the
Company.

 

(f) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each Third
Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the
24-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration
of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (and all analyses

 



32  and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains,
reflects or analyzes that information). The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to secure all such certifications as promptly as practicable. If
any such Person fails to provide any required certification within the time
period allotted in the relevant confidentiality agreement (or if no such
period is specified, then within a reasonable time period after the date
hereof), then the Company shall take all actions that may be reasonably
necessary to secure its rights and ensure the performance of such other
partys obligations thereunder as promptly as practicable.

 

 __Section 6.05 _. Employee Matters_. (a) Effective immediately prior to the
Closing, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and
all Company Employee Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (each a " __Company 401(k) Plan
__"), effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Day.
The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the resolutions adopted by the
Board of Directors of the Company terminating such Company 401(k) Plans. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable
advance approval of Parent. In connection with the termination by the Company
of any Company 401(k) Plan, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Parent Employee Plan intended to qualify as a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (the " __Parent
401(k) Plan __") to accept "direct rollovers" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from such Company 401(k) Plan to any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who remain employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries at the time of such rollover, including the
amount of any unpaid balance of any participant loan made under such Company
401(k) Plan, if such rollovers are elected by any such employee. __

(b) The Company shall ensure that (i) no new offering periods under the
Company ESPP will commence during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, (ii) there will be no increase in the amount of
payroll deductions permitted to be made by the participants under the Company
ESPP during the current offering periods, except those made in accordance
with payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, and (iii) no individuals shall commence participation in the
Company ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time. If applicable, the Company shall establish an early purchase
date under the Company ESPP that is at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time with respect to all offering periods otherwise then in
effect under the Company ESPP (the "Final Exercise Date"). Each purchase right
outstanding under the Company ESPP on the Final Exercise Date shall be
exercised on such date for Company Stock in accordance with the terms of the
Company ESPP and shall terminate immediately after such exercise. The Company
shall terminate the Company ESPP as of not later than the Business Day
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 __Section 6.06. _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent an
opportunity to participate in the defense (at Parents sole cost) of any
shareholder litigation brought against the Company or its directors or
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all filings or
responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such litigation,
and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to such litigation,
and the Company will in good faith take such comments into account, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). __

 

 __Section 6.07. _Termination of Existing Credit Facility_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and take all
other actions to facilitate the termination at the Closing of all commitments
in respect of the Existing Credit Facility, the repayment in full on the
Closing Date of all obligations in respect of the indebtedness
thereunder, and the release on the Closing Date of any Liens securing such
indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date an executed payoff letter with respect to the
Existing Credit Facility (the " __Payoff Letter __") in form and substance
customary for transactions of this type, from the Person or applicable agent
on behalf of the Persons to whom such indebtedness is owed, which Payoff
Letter together with any related release __

 



33 _ _ documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff amount and
provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in connection with the
Existing Credit Facility relating to the assets, rights and properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries securing such indebtedness, shall, upon the
payment of the amount set forth in the applicable Payoff Letter at or prior to
the Closing, be released and terminated. __

forth in this Agreement. __

 

 __Section 7.03 _. Voting of Shares._ Parent shall vote all shares of Company
Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of

following: __

 



34 (a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by
Oregon Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Companys
articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof or
agreements between an Indemnified Person and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof;  _provided_ that such indemnification
shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable
Law.

 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence in the Companys
articles of incorporation and bylaws on the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain (from the Companys current insurance carrier or from another
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance) and fully pay
the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or
prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons under the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any other matter claimed against a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided that the Company shall
give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such
tail policy and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto. If the
Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof

Corporation shall purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period
from another insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance and with

amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount

_provided further_ that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or

Section 7.06. _Employee Matters._

 

(a) Immediately following the Effective Time through December 31, 2016 (the
"Benefits Continuation Period"), Parent shall, and shall cause it
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, provide each continuing
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") with
(i) base salary (or base wages) and annualized cash target bonuses, in the
aggregate, no less favorable than the base salary (or base wages) and
annualized cash target bonuses, in the aggregate, provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) benefits (other
than equity-based benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee as of the date
of this Agreement (or, if greater, immediately prior to the Effective Time).
From and after the Effective Time, for the purposes of determining eligibility
to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant under any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including, the Surviving Corporation) to,
cause each Continuing Employee to receive service credit for service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the same extent such service credit was
granted under the Company Employee Plans (other than for the purposes of
benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan) immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
(including, the Surviving Corporation) to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions, waiting periods, actively-at-work
requirements, evidence-of-insurability requirements and all other limitations
and restrictions with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Continuing Employees (and any spouses, domestic partners,
dependents and beneficiaries thereof) under any welfare benefit plans that
such individuals may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time,
other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with
respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective
Time under any welfare benefit plan maintained for the Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments,
deductibles and other out-of-pocket amounts paid prior to the Effective Time
in satisfying any applicable co-payment, deductible and out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 7.06(a) shall
apply only with respect to Continuing Employees who are covered under Company
Employee Plans that are maintained primarily for the benefit of employees of
the Company employed in the United States (including Continuing Employees
regularly employed outside the United States to the extent they participate in
such Company Employee Plans). With respect to Continuing Employees not
described in the preceding sentence, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
comply with all applicable Laws relating to employees and employee benefits
matters applicable to such employees.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, the provisions of this
Section 7.06 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee or other service provider or other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall (i) constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any Company Employee
Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries for any purpose, (ii)
guarantee employment for any period of time, or

 



36  preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to terminate any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any reason, (iii) require Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company
Employee Plan, employee benefits plans or arrangements or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof, in accordance with the terms
thereof and Applicable Law.

Section 7.07. _Financing Efforts._

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
consummate the Financing or any Substitute Financing on the terms, and subject
to the conditions, set forth in the Commitment Letter, including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with and maintain in effect
the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter (or with conditions no less favorable to Parent than the
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter), (iii) satisfy on a timely
basis all the conditions to the Financing and the definitive agreements
related thereto and (iv) not take or fail to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the availability of the Financing
on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Parent
shall, after obtaining Knowledge thereof, give the Company prompt written
notice of any (A) material breach or default by a Financing Party or any
party to the Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the
Financing or (B) withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Financing by
the Financing Parties. In the event that all conditions to the Commitment
Letter have been satisfied (other than the consummation of the Merger),
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Parties to
fund the amount of the Financing at or prior to the Closing, to the extent the
proceeds thereof are required to consummate the Closing, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that new
commitment letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of the Commitment Letter
permitted pursuant to this Section 7.07, such new commitment letters will be
deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and deemed to be the "Commitment
Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent shall promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day after its receipt thereof) deliver to the
Company copies of any termination, amendment, modification, waiver or
replacement of the Commitment Letter or any fee letters. Parent will not
amend, modify, waive or replace the Commitment Letter in a manner that adds
material conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing on the Closing
Date or that could otherwise reasonably be expected to impair, delay or
prevent the availability of all or a part of the Financing in any material
respect, without the Sellers prior written consent (it being understood and
agreed that, in any event, Parent may amend the Commitment Letter to add
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that
have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement).

(b) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letter, or any
portion thereof, become unavailable to Parent, or it becomes reasonably likely
that such funds may become unavailable to Parent on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, Parent shall as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event (x) notify the Company in
writing thereof, (y) use reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute
financing sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the Closing and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Substitute Financing") and (z) use reasonable best efforts to obtain a new
financing commitment letter that provides for such Substitute Financing (on
comparable or more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable
judgment of Parent) than those set forth in the Commitment Letter) and,
promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the Company true and complete
copies of the new commitment letter and the related fee letters (in redacted
form reasonably satisfactory to the Persons providing such Substitute
Financing) and related definitive financing documents with respect to such
Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute
Financing, such financing will be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and
any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be deemed the
"Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement.

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before August 4, 2016 (the "End

failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before the End Date;

 

(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law that (A) makes consummation of the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) enjoins the Company or Parent
from consummating the Merger and such injunction shall have become final and
nonappealable; or

postponement thereof), the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been
obtained; or



     | (c) | by Parent, if:

event within five Business Days) after receipt of any written request to do so
from Parent;

 

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being
satisfied by the End Date; or

 

(iii) there shall have been an intentional and material breach of Section 6.03
or Section 6.04; or

 



     | (d) | by the Company, if:

that the Company shall have paid any amounts due pursuant to Section 11.04(b)
in accordance with the terms, and at the times, specified therein; or

without liability of any party (or any stockholder, shareholder, director,
officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the
other party hereto; _provided_ , that, if such termination shall result from
the intentional (i) breach by any party of any representation or warranty on
the part of such party set forth in this Agreement or (ii) failure of either
party to perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable for any
and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a
result of such failure. The provisions of this Section 10.02, Section 8.06,
Article 11 (other than Section 11.13) and the Confidentiality Agreement shall

 __Section 11.04 _. Expenses._ (a) _General_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense. __

(b) _Termination Fee_.

 

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)
or 10.01(c)(iii) or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), then the
Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds $10,830,000 (the
"Termination Fee"), in the case of a termination by Parent, within one
Business 

 



46  Day after such termination and, in the case of a termination by the Company,
immediately before and as a condition to such termination.

 

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) (other than in the circumstances described in Section
11.04(b)(iii)) or Section 10.01(b)(iii), (B) after the date of this Agreement
and prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or otherwise been communicated to the Board of Directors
of the Company or its shareholders and (C) within 12 months following the date
of such termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to or recommended to its shareholders an Acquisition
Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated ( _provided_
that for purposes of this clause (C), each reference to "15%" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference
to "50%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available
funds, concurrently with the occurrence of the applicable event described in
clause (C), the Termination Fee.

 

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) and, as of the termination date, (A) one or more of the
Regulatory Conditions has not been satisfied and (B) all of the other
conditions set forth in Sections 9.01 and 9.02 have been satisfied or waived
(other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing Date but subject to such conditions being capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of termination) (provided that for
purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 9.02(a)
or 9.02(c) have been satisfied, the definition of "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall be interpreted without taking into account any effect resulting
from or any action taken or instituted by a Governmental Authority in
connection with the HSR Act), then Parent shall pay to the Company in
immediately available funds $16,245,000 (the "Antitrust Termination Fee"), in
the case of a termination by the Company, within five Business Days after
such termination and, in the case of a termination by Parent, immediately
before and as a condition to such termination. Notwithstanding the above, no
Antitrust Termination Fee shall be payable by Parent pursuant to this Section
11.04(b)(iii) if (x) the failure of a Regulatory Condition to be satisfied is
caused by an intentional and material breach by the Company of Section 8.01 or
(y) Parent has delivered to the Company an Extension Notice and the Company
fails to provide its written consent to the extension of the End Date by the
Extension Deadline.

(iv) The Termination Fee or Antitrust Termination Fee, if payable, shall be
payable only once even though the Termination Fee or Antitrust Termination Fee
may be payable under one or more provisions of this Agreement.

 

(c) _Other Costs and Expenses_. Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, none of the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary would enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails promptly to pay
any amount due to Parent or the Company, as applicable, pursuant to this
Section 11.04, such party shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary or the Company, as applicable, in connection with
a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against
the Company or Parent, as applicable, for such amount, together with interest
on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced
prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost or expense was
required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud, if
either the Termination Fee or Antitrust Termination Fee is required to be
paid as a result of termination of this Agreement, then Parents receipt of
the Termination Fee or the Companys receipt of the Antitrust Termination Fee,
as applicable, pursuant to this Section 11.04 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise) of Parent
and its Affiliates against the Company or any of its shareholders, directors,
officers, agents or other Affiliates or Representatives (in the case of
the Termination Fee) or the Company and its Affiliates against Parent or any
of its respective shareholders, directors, officers, agents or other
Affiliates or Representatives (in the case of the Antitrust Termination Fee)
for (x) any and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered as a result
of the failure of the Merger to be completed and (y) any and all other
liabilities and damages incurred or

 



47  suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (1) upon payment of the Termination Fee in
accordance with this Section 11.04, neither the Company nor any of its
shareholders, directors, officers, agents or other Affiliates or
Representatives, shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (2) upon payment of the Antitrust Termination Fee in
accordance with this Section 11.04, neither Parent nor any of its
shareholders, directors, officers, agents or other Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that if (A) Parent or Merger Subsidiary receives any
payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement and
thereafter Parent receives the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 11.04
or (B) the Company receives any payments from Parent or Merger Subsidiary in
respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter the Company receives
the Antitrust Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 11.04, the amount of
such Termination Fee or Antitrust Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be
reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made by the party paying the
Termination Fee or Antitrust Termination fee, as applicable, in respect of any
such breaches; and, _provided further_ , that the foregoing shall not impair
the rights of Parent or the Company, if any, to obtain injunctive relief
pursuant to Section 11.13 prior to any termination of this Agreement.

__Section 11.05 _. Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References._ (a) The
parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be
deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes
of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of
the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties of such party
that is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that
reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such

any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document shall only be deemed to be an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) the applicable party s
representations and warranties if the relevance of that information as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations
and warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read
that information concurrently with such representations and warranties,
without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the
matter(s) so disclosed;  _provided_ that in no event shall any information
contained in any part of any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document
entitled "Risk Factors" or containing a description or explanation of forward-
looking statements be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) any representations and warranties of any party contained in this
Agreement. __

of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section

successors and assigns and, to the extent provided in the immediately
succeeding sentence, the Financing Parties. No provision of this Agreement is

hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

 



48 Section 11.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state (except that the provisions

and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written

affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible. __

requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection
therewith. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
(a) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates that none of the Financing Parties shall have any

the fullest extent permitted under the Act, as it now exists or may hereafter
be amended, against all expense, liability, and loss (including, without
limitation, attorney fees) incurred or suffered by such a person by reason of
or arising from the fact that the person is or was a director of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or
domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan, or other enterprise, and such indemnification will continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee,
or agent and will inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors, and
administrators. The Corporation may, by action of the board of directors,
provide indemnification to officers, employees, and agents of the Corporation
