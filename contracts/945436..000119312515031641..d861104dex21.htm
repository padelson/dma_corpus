ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS

 

1.01 _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement, the following defined terms
have the meanings indicated below:

 

"Accelerated Earnout Payment" means, with respect to any Earnout Project, the
amount set forth on _Annex C_ with respect to such Earnout Project.

"Acceleration Event" means (a) a failure by Holdco Buyer to make timely
payments under Section 2.04 totaling at least $15 million in the aggregate
outstanding at any time; _provided_ that, in the case of the first two such
payment failures by Holdco Buyer, Holdco Buyer shall have 20 days following
such payment due date to cure such payment default, (b) any bankruptcy,
reorganization, debt arrangement or other proceeding under any bankruptcy or
insolvency law, or any dissolution or liquidation proceeding, instituted by or
against Holdco Buyer or the Company or its successor entity or one of its
Affiliates into which the existing development platform is subsequently
incorporated that remains undismissed, undischarged or unbonded for a period
of 20 days, (c) Holdco Buyer or any of its Affiliates terminates the
employment of the person listed

 



2  on Part 1 of Schedule 1.01(l) other than for Cause or such person terminates
his employment with Holdco Buyer or any of its Affiliates for Good Reason or
(d) Holdco Buyer or any of its Affiliates terminates the employment of any
two of the persons listed on Part 2 of Schedule 1.01(l), in each case without
Cause or any two of such individuals terminates his employment with Holdco
Buyer or any of its Affiliates for Good Reason. 

"Acquisition Proposal" means, other than dispositions permitted in accordance
with Section 6.02, any proposal for a sale, transfer, merger or other
business combination with respect to the Company or any of the Operating
Entities or any of their Subsidiaries or assets, other than (a) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the Route 66 Project, (c)
the Palouse Project or (d) the Pre-Closing Restructuring.

"Action" means any action, suit, proceeding, arbitration or Governmental
Authority investigation.

"Actual Unlevered CAFD" means, with respect to the Operating Projects, net
cash provided by (used in) operating activities (i) _plus or minus_ changes
in assets and liabilities as reflected in a statement of cash flows, net of
acquisitions, (ii) _minus_ deposits into (or plus withdrawals from)
restricted cash accounts required by tax equity and lease arrangements to the
extent they decrease (or increase) cash provided by operating activities,
(iii) _minus_ cash distributions paid to non-controlling interests
in Operating Projects (including tax equity and lease rents), if any, (iv)
_minus_ non-expansionary capital expenditures, if any, to the extent they are
paid from operating cash flows during a period, (v) _plus_ the Excluded
Capex, (vi) _minus_ Excluded OandM Costs (except to the extent such amount has
already been included as a deduction under any of (i) to (v) in the definition
hereof). Overhead allocation (Administrative Service Fee, Tech
Services, DACC/SCADA, and IT) shall be consistent with past practice. Letters
of credit costs to support project level obligations (excluding any financing
obligations) shall be reasonable and consistent with current rates. For the
avoidance of doubt, Actual Unlevered CAFD shall also be equal to the cash
distributions actually made from the Operating Project cash accounts to
Operating Buyer plus the Excluded Capex less any one-time releases from
restricted cash accounts. Any increase in Actual Unlevered CAFD that is
attributable to a repurchase of tax equity or other minority interests in any
of the Operating Projects will be deducted from Actual Unlevered CAFD.

 

"Additional Earnout Project" means (a) any project in development by any
Company Entity as of the Closing Date listed on  _Annex D_ or (b) (i) one or
more other solar development projects that are not listed on _Annex D_ and are
solely sourced or generated (including through one or more acquisitions) by
the Company or its successor entity or division of Holdco Buyer or one of its
Affiliates into which the existing development platform is subsequently
incorporated prior to or after the Closing Date, (ii) one or more wind
projects, that are not listed on _Annex D_ other than wind operating projects
that are sourced through one or more acquisitions after Closing by a Buyer
without material involvement of any person who was an employee of the Company
on or prior to Closing, in the case of each of (a) or (b), with a comparable
economic profile on a proportional basis to the Earnout Project it is
replacing regardless of the comparability of the MWac of such Project. At
least one Business Day prior to the Closing, the Sellers 

 



3  shall deliver a revised _Annex D_ , which will be updated solely to reflect
projects in development by any Company Entity that were not listed on _Annex
D_ as of the date hereof.

 

"Adjusted Unlevered CAFD" means Actual Unlevered CAFD adjusted for variances
in gross generation, merchant power prices, and utility curtailment in
Hawaii, calculated in accordance with the model attached as _Schedule
1.01(c)_.

 

"Affiliate" means any Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with
the Person specified; _provided_ that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
of the Company shall be considered an Affiliate of any Seller. For purposes of
this definition, "control" of a Person means the power, direct or indirect,
to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person
whether through the ownership of voting securities or ownership interests, by
Contract or otherwise, and specifically with respect to a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company, means direct or indirect ownership
of more than 50% of the voting securities in such corporation or of the voting
interest in such partnership or limited liability company.

Agreement.

(and approved by the Sponsors) at least three (3) Business Days prior to
Closing, setting forth each Sellers individual allocation of the Holdco
Closing Consideration, the Earnout Project Payments and any Escrow Return
Amounts, as reasonably adjusted by the Sellers Representative from time to
time at or after the Closing in connection with the indemnification of Buyers

Units held by the Blockers) bears to the aggregate number of Series A Units,
and (B) the cash in an amount equal to the remaining amount of the Closing
Cash to which such holder or Blocker Parent, as applicable, is entitled in
accordance with the Allocation Schedule.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) above, if a Series A Unitholder is
not able to make the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.09

in cash, and in such case the aggregate amount of Exchangeable Notes to be
issued to the Series A Unitholders and Blocker Parent (other than such Non-
Qualified Holder) at Closing, pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(ii), shall be
thereby reduced.

 

(d) Holdco Buyer shall be able to pay the entire amount of the Holdco Closing
Consideration in cash (the "Cash Alternative") if, at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to Closing, Buyers provide written notice of such intention to the
Sellers Representative and the Series A Unitholders, in their sole and
absolute discretion, agree to accept the Cash Alternative and inform Holdco
Buyer in writing of such election

(a) In accordance with the terms of this Section 2.04, with respect to each
Earnout Project that achieves Earnout Project Completion on or before the
Earnout Project Completion Outside Date, Holdco Buyer shall pay in accordance
with Section 2.04(b) an amount in cash equal to the As-Built MW of such
Earnout Project multiplied by the Per MW Earnout Payment (each, an
"Earnout Project Payment"). Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) if Earnout Project Completion for any Earnout
Project has not occurred on or prior to the applicable Earnout Project
Completion Outside Date, then Holdco Buyer shall have no further obligations
under this Section 2.04 with respect to such Earnout Project, including any
obligation to pay an Earnout Project Payment with respect to such Earnout
Project and (ii) in no event shall the aggregate Earnout Project Payments
exceed $510,000,000.

(b) Except as provided in Section 2.04(j), Holdco Buyer shall pay or cause to
be paid each Earnout Project Payment to the Paying Agent on behalf of the
Sellers within 30 days of the date on which such Earnout Project Payment
achieves Earnout Project Completion in accordance with this Section 2.04;
_provided_ that with respect to each Four Brothers Project, Holdco Buyer
shall pay or cause to be paid the Earnout Project Payment to the Paying Agent
on behalf of the Sellers with respect to each such project on the later of (i)
30 days following Earnout Project Completion and (ii) December 15, 2015. The
Paying Agent shall pay or distribute, as applicable, each Earnout Project
Payment to the Sellers promptly after it receives the same in accordance with
the Allocation Schedule. Without limiting Holdco Buyers obligations to pay
any given Earnout Payment, Holdco Buyer shall deposit in a segregated account
the sale proceeds it receives from the sale of the applicable Earnout Project
to Operating Buyer or any other third Person, and with respect to such
account, repayment of debt associated with such Project shall be the only
distributions which may be made in priority to the payment of the Earnout
Project Payment.

 

(c) With respect to each Earnout Project, Holdco Buyer hereby covenants and
agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, unless Holdco Buyer obtains the
prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, (A) one of the PPA
agreements or interconnection agreements set forth on Part 2 of _Annex C_ , or
after achievement of the applicable item set forth in Part 3, Part 3 of 
_Annex C_ (which thereafter shall be deemed to be included on Part 2 of _Annex
C_ ) with respect to such Earnout Project is terminated other than as a result
of an action taken or omitted to be taken by Buyers after Closing, (B) one
of the permits set forth on Part 2 of _Annex C_ or after achievement of the
applicable item set forth in Part 3, Part 3 of _Annex C_ (which thereafter
shall be deemed to be included on Part 2 of _Annex C_ ) with respect to such
Earnout Project is terminated or amended other than as a result of an action
taken or omitted to be taken by Buyers after Closing and such termination or
amendment has a material adverse effect on the ability to reach Earnout
Project Completion by the Earnout Project Completion Outside Date, (C) one of
the PPA agreements set forth on Part 2 of _Annex C_ , or after achievement of
the

 



30  applicable item set forth in Part 3, Part 3 of _Annex C_ (which thereafter
shall be deemed to be included on Part 2 of _Annex C_ ) with respect to such
Earnout Project is amended and such amendment has a material adverse effect
on the ability to reach Earnout Project Completion by the Earnout Project
Completion Outside Date, (D) the Company (or its successor or assign) fails to
fulfill one of the items set forth on Part 3 of _Annex C_ after Holdco Buyer
has fully funded the financial commitment set forth on Part 3 of _Annex C_ for
such Earnout Project; _provided_ that Holdco Buyers obligation to fund such
Earnout Project shall cease upon the occurrence of an event that makes the
fulfillment of one of the items set forth on Part 3 of _Annex C_ unachievable
with respect to such Project by the Earnout Project Completion Outside Date
applicable thereto, (E) by the day of FNTP an Earnout Project does not have
Site Control, (F) such Earnout Project becomes unviable for the Renewable
Electricity Production Tax Credit or Federal Investment Energy Tax Credit
solely due to an action taken or inaction on the part of or one or more of
the Company Entities or the Sellers, in each case prior to Closing, (G) such
Earnout Project becomes unviable due to unforeseen subsurface conditions, or
(H) any of the Company Approval listed as item 3 on part 2 of Schedule
3.18 are not obtained (each, a "Disqualifying Event"):

(i) Holdco Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary under Applicable Law to achieve Earnout
Project Completion with respect to such Earnout Project on or prior to the
Earnout Project Completion Outside Date, including providing funding for all
necessary capital expenditures in a timely manner and continuing the
employment of all applicable Key Employees (as set forth on Part C of _Annex
C_ ) to facilitate the construction and development of such Earnout Project;
_provided_  that with respect to the continued employment of all Key
Employees, Holdco Buyer shall only be in breach of this 2.04(a)(i) if it or
any of its Affiliates terminates any such Key Employee without Cause or such
Key Employee terminates his or her employment for Good Reason; and

(ii) Holdco Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, dispose of, transfer
(either by merger, consolidation, disposition of stock or assets or
otherwise) or cease to pursue the construction and development of such Earnout
Project other than to a special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of
funding the construction of the Earnout Projects and in connection with which
Holdco Buyer retains operational and management control of such Earnout
Projects. For the avoidance of doubt, Holdco Buyer will remain liable for all
payments and obligations under this Agreement, including this Section 2.04
regardless of such transfer.

(d) Upon the election by Holdco Buyer to cease its pursuit of the development
of an Earnout Project after the occurrence of a Disqualifying Event, Holdco
Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative notice of such election within
three Business Days and the Sellers Representative shall have until the
earlier of (i) 30 days from the date on which the Sellers Representative
received such notice (which period shall be extended by a further period of 60
days if the Sellers Representative is diligently pursuing a cure) and (ii)
the applicable Earnout Project Completion Outside Date to cure such
Disqualifying

 



31  Event provided until the earlier of the end of the cure period or such
Disqualifying Event is cured, Holdco Buyer may discontinue funding such
Project. Holdco Buyer will reasonably cooperate with the Sellers
Representative at the Sellers Representatives sole cost, regarding any cure
that the Sellers Representative reasonably proposes.

 

(e) Holdco Buyer shall deliver or otherwise make available in a dataroom to
the Sellers Representative development status reports with respect to each
Earnout Project on a reasonable, periodic basis, but no less frequently than
monthly and shall afford the Sellers Representative and its Representatives,
during normal business hours, reasonable access to the books, records
and other data relating to the development status of the Earnout Projects.

(f) In the event the Sellers Representative becomes aware or believes that
Holdco Buyer has breached a covenant set forth in Section 2.04(c), the
Sellers Representative shall deliver to Holdco Buyer written notice
containing details of such alleged breach no later than ten (10) days after
the Sellers Representative becomes aware of such alleged breach. Holdco
Buyer shall have the right to cure such breach, in the case of a payment
default, within 15 days and in the case of any other default, within 30 days
(which period shall be extended by a further period of 60 days if Holdco
Buyer is diligently pursuing a cure) after the receipt of notice from the
Sellers Representative. In the event that Holdco Buyer cures such breach,
Holdco Buyer shall have no obligation to make any Accelerated Earnout Payment
to the Sellers in respect of such breach; _provided_ that the Earnout Project
Completion Outside Date with respect to the Earnout Project to which such
breach relates shall be extended for a number of days equal to the duration
of such breach. In the event that Holdco Buyer does not cure such breach,
Holdco Buyer shall immediately deliver or cause to be delivered to the Paying
Agent on behalf of the Sellers the applicable Accelerated Earnout Payment
that relates to the applicable Project.

(g) In the event that an Acceleration Event shall occur, Buyers shall
immediately deliver or cause to be delivered the aggregate Accelerated
Earnout Payment to the Paying Agent on behalf of the Sellers for each Earnout
Project for which no Earnout Project Payment has been made.

 

(h) In the event of any dispute arising under this Section 2.04 with respect
to whether Earnout Project Completion has been attained, the occurrence of a
Disqualifying Event or as to the As-Built MW in respect of any Earnout
Project, senior management of Holdco Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve such dispute.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.04, Holdco
Buyer shall not be in breach of the covenants provided in Section 2.04(c)
with respect to a particular Earnout Project if Holdco Buyer both (i) delivers
to the Sellers a notice of its election not to proceed with such Earnout
Project and (ii) pays to the Paying Agent on behalf of the Sellers
the Accelerated Earnout Payment with respect to such Earnout Project within
five Business Days of the delivery of such notice.

 



32 (j) Each Buyer hereby acknowledges that it shall have no right under this
Agreement to offset any amounts owed (or to become due and owing) to it,
whether under this Agreement or otherwise, against Holdco Buyers obligation
to pay the Earnout Project Payments, except to the extent (i) of any Losses
that are the subject of claims properly and timely made pursuant to Section
11.02(a) and (ii) there is an agreement among the Parties on the amount of
such Losses or, in the event of a dispute, such Losses have been determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction in a final order. If on the date that is
fifteen months after the Closing Date, either Buyer has any Losses that are
the subject of claims properly made pursuant to Section 11.02(a), Holdco Buyer
shall have the right to holdback the amount of such Losses from any Earnout
Project Payment(s) that are or thereafter become due until resolution of such
claims in accordance with Article XI.

2.05  _Escrow; Paying Agent_.

(a) At the Closing, Operating Buyer shall deposit an amount in cash equal to
$20 million of the Operating Entity Base Purchase Price (the "Escrow Funds")
to a separate account designated by the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Account") to
be governed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Funds shall be used solely to satisfy any amounts owed
to Operating Buyer under Section 2.06.

(b) (i) On or prior to March 11, 2016 and March 11, 2017 (the "Final Release
Date"), Operating Buyer shall cause an amount, if positive, equal to (A) $10
million _minus_ (B) the CAFD Shortfall Amount to be immediately released from
the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent on behalf of the
Sellers and (ii) on the Final Release Date, Operating Buyer shall cause the
balance of the Escrow Account (after the reimbursement of any amounts owed to
Operating Buyer pursuant to Section 2.06 and any disbursement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (i)) to be immediately released by the Escrow Agent to the
Paying Agent on behalf of the Sellers. The Paying Agent shall pay to the
Sellers the amounts released from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section
2.05(b) promptly after it receives the same in accordance with the Allocation
Schedule.

(c) Upon the final release of all of amounts in the Escrow Account, the
Escrow Agreement shall terminate. Any fees owed to the Escrow Agent and
indemnification obligations under the Escrow Agreement shall be borne equally
by Operating Buyer and Sellers. 

(d) The Escrow Funds shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to
any encumbrance, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of
any creditor of any Party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the
purposes and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Escrow Funds shall not be
the property of any Party until they are released.

(e) Buyers shall be responsible for and shall pay and discharge all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges imposed on or with respect to the Escrow
Funds.

(f) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall appoint an agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the purpose of distributing the Holdco Closing Consideration, the
Earnout Project Payments and any Escrow Return Amounts to the Sellers. Any
amounts owed to the Paying Agent shall be paid by the Sellers.

 



33 2.06 _CAFD Shortfall_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.06, subsequent to
the Closing Date, the Sellers shall reimburse Operating Buyer for any CAFD
Shortfall Amounts, but only to the extent of any funds remaining in the Escrow
Account. Prior to any reimbursement, Operating Buyer shall deliver to the
Sellers Representative a notice setting forth Operating Buyers good
faith calculation of Adjusted Unlevered CAFD. Such notice shall be
accompanied by copies of the applicable spreadsheet substantially in the form
set forth on Schedule 1.01(c) with respect to the calculation of such Adjusted
Unlevered CAFD. Within five days of receipt of such notice, the Sellers
Representative shall notify Operating Buyer whether it disputes such
calculation of Adjusted Unlevered CAFD. The Operating Buyer shall provide to
the Sellers Representative all supporting documentation reasonably requested
by the Sellers Representative with respect to the calculation of the CAFD
Shortfall Amount. If the Sellers Representative does not respond within such
five day period, it shall be deemed to agree with Operating Buyers
calculation of Adjusted Unlevered CAFD. In the event of any dispute arising
under this Section 2.06 with respect to the CAFD Shortfall Amount in any
Fiscal Year, senior management of Operating Buyer and the
Sellers Representative shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve such
dispute. If the parties are unable to so resolve such dispute within five
Business Days, such dispute will be submitted to Deloitte LLP or such other
national independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Operating Buyer
and the Sellers Representative (the "Neutral Accounting Arbitrator").
Operating Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator to resolve
such dispute as soon as practicable, but in any event shall direct the Neutral
Accounting Arbitrator to render a determination within 20 days after its
retention. The determination of the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Neutral Accounting Arbitrator in resolving such dispute shall be borne by the
party which, in the conclusive judgment of the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator,
is not the prevailing party. If the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator does not
make its determination by the end of such 20 day period (other than by reason
of Operating Buyers breach of its obligations under this Section
2.06(a)), Operating Buyer shall have the right to withdraw available funds
from the Escrow Account for the applicable CAFD Shortfall Amount. If, after
the determination by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator, Operating Buyer is not
the prevailing party in whole or in part, within two Business Days of such
determination Operating Buyer shall pay to the Paying Agent on behalf of the
Sellers the portion of the CAFD Shortfall Amount that the Neutral Accounting
Arbitrator determines Operating Buyer was not entitled to withdraw from the
Escrow Funds. The remedy provided in this Section 2.06(a) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy for the Sellers to challenge the Operating Buyers
calculation of the CAFD Shortfall Amount with respect to any Fiscal Year.

 



34 (b) At all times prior to the Final Release Date, Operating Buyer (i) shall
operate the Operating Projects in the ordinary course of business reasonably
consistent with the Companys past practice, (ii) shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Affiliates to, take any action in bad faith designed to
increase the CAFD Shortfall Amount, (iii) shall not, directly or indirectly,
dispose of, transfer (either by merger, consolidation, disposition of stock or
assets or otherwise) the Operating Projects or cease to operate the Operating
Projects other than in the ordinary course of business (including due to
mandatory curtailment, normal maintenance) or a catastrophic loss outside of
Operating Buyers control and (iv) shall keep adequate records and books of
account to the extent necessary to enable the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator
to fully review any CAFD Shortfall Amount. Operating Buyer hereby acknowledges
and agrees that if a breach of any of the foregoing covenants occurs and is
continuing, it shall not be entitled to any reimbursement under this Section
2.06 with respect to any CAFD Shortfall Amount.

(c) With respect to the reimbursement obligation by the Sellers for all
matters pursuant to Section 2.06(a), Operating Buyer hereby agrees that the
sole recourse of Operating Buyer in respect of all such matters shall be the
right to seek reimbursement from the Escrow Account in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, Operating Buyer shall
have no right to seek payment from any other source in respect of any such
matters, including directly from the Sellers. In no event shall the Sellers in
the aggregate be liable for any CAFD Shortfall Amount pursuant to Section
2.06(a) in excess of $10 million with respect to losses suffered in any Fiscal
Year.

 

(d) If, at any time prior to the Final Release Date, (i) more than 6 of the
employees of the Company set forth on _Schedule 2.06(d)_  (x) are terminated
by Holdco Buyer or any of its Affiliates without Cause or (y) terminate their
employment with Holdco Buyer or any of its Affiliates for Good Reason or (ii)
one of the events in clause (c) or (d) of the definition of "Acceleration
Event" occurs (each, a "CAFD Employee Acceleration Event"), all amounts
remaining in the Escrow Account shall be immediately released by the Escrow
Agent to the Paying Agent on behalf of the Sellers. The Paying Agent shall
pay to the Sellers the amounts released from the Escrow Fund or paid by
Operating Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.06(d) promptly after it receives
the same in accordance with the Allocation Schedule.

 

2.07 _Allocation of Consideration for Tax Purposes_. (a) The Holdco Closing
Consideration, plus any assumed liabilities (and any other pertinent items),
to the extent properly taken into account under the Code, shall be allocated
among the assets of the Holdco Entities (for this purpose looking through
entities that are disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
in accordance with the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (and any similar provision of state or local law, as appropriate)
(the "Holdco Allocation"). The Holdco Allocation shall be delivered by Holdco
Buyer to the Sellers Representative within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date for the Sellers Representatives review and consent. Holdco Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes
relating to the Holdco Allocation. If Holdco Buyer and the Sellers
Representative are unable to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days
following the delivery of the Holdco Allocation by Holdco Buyer to
the Sellers Representative, such dispute shall be resolved by the Neutral
Accounting Arbitrator in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.06(a).

 



35 (b) The Operating Entity Closing Consideration, plus any assumed liabilities
(and any other pertinent items), to the extent properly taken into account
under the Code, shall be allocated among the assets of Operating Entities (for
this purpose looking through entities that are disregarded entities for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of
state or local law, as appropriate) (the "Operating Entity Allocation" and,
together with the Holdco Allocation, the "Allocation"). The Operating Entity
Allocation shall be delivered by Operating Buyer to the Sellers
Representative within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date for the Sellers
Representatives review and consent. Operating Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to
the Operating Entity Allocation. If Operating Buyer and the Sellers
Representative are unable to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days
following the delivery of the Operating Entity Allocation by Operating Buyer
to the Sellers Representative, such dispute shall be resolved by the Neutral
Accounting Arbitrator in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.06(a).

(c) The Parties shall file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594)
consistent with the applicable Allocation. None of the Parties shall take any
Tax position inconsistent with the applicable Allocation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent any Party from
settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority based
upon or arising out of the applicable Allocation, and no Party shall be
required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Tax Authority challenging such Allocation.

 

2.08 _Specified Platform Equity Interests_. On or prior to December 20, 2014,
Holdco Buyer shall deliver to Blocker Parent and the Company a proposed list
of Platform Equity Interests ("Nominated Entities") with an aggregate amount
of items of income and gain that would be allocable to the Blockers for U.S.
federal income tax purposes with respect to the sale of the such Nominated
Entities if such Nominated Entities were sold as Specified Platform Equity
Interests pursuant to Section 2.03(a) equal to at least twice the higher of
(i) $28.5 million and (ii) amount of the Blockers aggregate net operating
losses at such time, as determined in good faith by Blocker Parent (the higher
of the amounts in (i) and (ii) the "Target Amount") and following delivery of
such list, but no later than January 26, 2015, Blocker Parent in consultation
with the Company shall elect and notify Holdco Buyer which of the Nominated
Entities shall be sold pursuant to Section 2.03(a) provided that the aggregate
amount of items of income and gain that would be allocable to the Blockers
for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such sale shall be equal
to (a) not less than 90% of the Target Amount, and (b) not greater than 100%
of the Target Amount. In the event that no combination of Nominated Entities
can be chosen to satisfy both clauses (a) and (b) of the preceding sentence,
then, (x) if the 90% requirement in clause (a) of the preceding sentence is
not satisfied, Holdco Buyer may, in its sole discretion, waive such
requirement and (y) if the 100% requirement of clause (b) of the preceding
sentence is not satisfied the parties will work in good faith (including
providing reasonably requested 

 



36  documentation to Holdco Buyer) to find a combination of Specified Platform
Equity Interests that satisfies such requirement and on failure to mutually
agree on such combination, Holdco Buyer may, in its sole discretion, either
(i) purchase less than 100% of the membership interests of one or more
Platform Entities in order to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) and
clause (b) of the preceding sentence or (ii) waive any right to
indemnification, including under this Agreement, for any Tax of a Blocker that
is in excess of the Tax that would have been imposed on the Blocker if the
aggregate amount of items of income and gain arising from the sale was equal
to 100% of the Target Amount; provided that if, taking into account the
foregoing, the requirements of both clauses (a) and (b) of the preceding
sentence cannot be satisfied, there shall be no sale of Specified Platform
Equity Interests. In the event that either Blocker Parent or Holdco Buyer
disagrees with the value of the aggregate amount of items of income and gain
that would be allocable to the relevant Specified Platform Equity Interests,
Blocker Parent and Holdco Buyer shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve such
dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within 5 Business
Days such parties shall submit such dispute to the Neutral Accounting
Arbitrator and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
independent accounting firm to make a final binding determination of such
aggregate amounts within 20 days after its retention, which determination
shall be binding and conclusive on such parties. The fees, costs and expenses
of the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator in resolving such dispute shall be borne
by the party which, in the conclusive judgment of the Neutral Accounting
Arbitrator, is not the prevailing party. If the Closing is expected to occur
before selection of the Nominated Entities that will be sold pursuant to
Section 2.03 in accordance with this Section 2.08, Blocker Parent and Holdco
Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to select such Nominated Entities before
the Closing.

 

2.09 _Buyers Obligations_. All obligations of each Buyer under this Agreement,
including any payment obligations, shall be several, and not joint.

asserted after the Closing Date. Any claims for indemnification made under

required by Applicable Law, the Organizational Documents of the Company

following the Closing Date (including with respect to acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to
the DandO Indemnified Parties than those of such policies in effect on the date
hereof). Buyers shall maintain such policy in full force and effect from and
after the Closing Date. 

 



70  In addition, Holdco Buyer shall purchase and maintain after Closing an
employed lawyers professional liability policy on terms as currently

that the successors and assigns of such Buyer shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 6.13.

 

(e) The obligations under this Section 6.13 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party to

Buyer, and following the Closing, with any Company Entity, it being the
intention of the Parties that all such rights to such attorney-client
privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by
the Sellers; provided that the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of
retention shall not extend to any communication not involving this Agreement
or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby, or to
communications with any Person other than the Designated Persons and their
advisers.

6.15 _Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, (a) the Company shall deliver
to Buyers (i) the resignations of all managers of each Company Entity (ii) as

any similarly situated officer or designate an existing officer of Holdco
Buyer to serve in such capacity).

6.16 _Section 280G_. In the event that the Parties reasonably determine that
Section 280G of the Code may apply to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then to the extent that (1) any Covered Person would be entitled to
any payment or benefit in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (2) such payment or benefit would constitute a "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code, the Company shall, prior to the
Closing:

 

(a) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a binding written waiver by
such Covered Person of any such portion of such parachute payment as exceeds
2.99 times such Covered Persons "base amount" within the meaning of Section

pursuant to a vote of the stockholders of the Company in accordance with the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code;

(b) provide to the Company Members such disclosure as is required under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code; and

party or pursuant to which any Company Entity paid or received more than
$500,000 for the previous twelve (12) months, other than operations and

deemed "Company Contracts" pursuant to this Agreement. Upon delivery by the
Company of the revised _Schedule 3.08_, the original _Schedule 3.08_
delivered on the date hereof shall be deemed to be superseded by such
revised  _Schedule 3.08_.

6.19 _Financing_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyers acknowledge and agree that Buyers obligations hereunder are not
conditioned in any manner upon Buyers obtaining any financing. The failure,
for any reason, of Buyers to deliver sufficient funds to pay the Holdco
Closing Consideration or the Operating Entity Closing Consideration on the
Closing Date shall constitute a willful and material breach of this
Agreement. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyers acknowledge and
agree that the existence of any conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters or the Debt Financing shall not constitute, nor be construed to
constitute, a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(b) Buyers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) arrange the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letters, (ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (on terms no

as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than
the Closing, and (iii) consummate the Debt Financing no later than the
Closing (it being understood that any bridge facility described in the Debt
Commitment Letters may be terminated or reduced in accordance with the terms
of the applicable Debt Commitment Letter) provided that (x) the Buyers will
not, and will not permit their Affiliates to, consummate any debt or equity
financing that reduces or terminates the bridge facility commitments prior to
the Closing Date unless the proceeds thereof are held in the form of cash
or temporary cash investments by the relevant Buyer until the Closing Date
and (y) Holdco Buyer will not without Sellers consent permit the bridge
facility commitment under the Debt Commitment Letter to be terminated because
it has been reduced to $300 million unless Holdco Buyer delivers evidence to
the Company that it has obtained substitute financing in an amount sufficient
to permit Holdco Buyer to consummate the Transactions contemplated hereby. In
the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable in the
manner or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, (A)
Buyers shall promptly notify the Sellers and (B) Buyers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from
alternative sources, on terms that are not materially less favorable from the
standpoint of Buyers than the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, including
entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto (such definitive
agreements entered into

 



73  pursuant to the first or second sentence of this Section (b) being referred
to as the "Financing Agreements"). Buyers shall (x) furnish to the Company
complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing Agreements promptly
upon their execution, (y) give the Company prompt notice of any material
breach by any party of any of the Debt Commitment Letters, any alternative
financing commitment or the Financing Agreements of which Buyers become aware
or any termination thereof and (z) otherwise keep the Company reasonably
informed of the status of Buyers efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (or
any replacement thereof).

 

(c) The Company shall, at the sole cost of Buyers, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to use their commercially reasonable efforts to, provide all
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of such Debt Financing and any
related financings described in the Debt Commitment Letters (the "Related
Financings") as may be reasonably requested by Buyers (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the business of the
Company), including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) participate
in meetings, due diligence sessions, presentations, and sessions with rating
agencies, (ii) assist with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, registration statements, confidential information memoranda
and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing or
Related Financings, (iii) furnish Buyers and the Financing Sources with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries including the Required Information, (iv) obtain customary
accountants comfort letters and consents from the Companys independent
auditors with respect to the Required Information; and (v) assist with the
preparation of any pledge and security documents or other definitive
financing documents and facilitating the pledging of collateral as may be
reasonably requested by a Buyer, _provided_ that no obligation or pledge of
the Company or its Subsidiaries under any such document or agreement shall be
effective until the Closing.

(d) Each Buyer shall indemnify, severally but not jointly, and hold harmless
Sellers and each of their respective directors, officers, managers, employees,
stockholders, representatives and Affiliates, from and against any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with such
Buyers arrangement of its portion of the Financing, any cooperation provided
pursuant to this Section 6.19 and any information utilized in connection
therewith, except in the event such Losses arose out of or result from the
gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation
of any Seller, any Company Entity or any such directors, officers, managers,
employees, stockholders, representatives and Affiliates.

 

(e) Within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date hereof, Buyers shall provide
to the Sellers written notice of any Debt Obligations of the Company Entities
that Buyers plan to repay in full at the Closing (which shall include any
Interim Debt Obligations). The Company shall, at the sole cost of Buyers, use
its commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to, provide commercially reasonable cooperation in connection with the
repayment of such Debt Obligations. Buyers acknowledge and agree that their
obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon the

 



74  Company obtaining consent under any Contract with respect to a Debt
Obligation. For the avoidance of doubt Buyer shall bear (i) the cost of
obtaining any consents under Debt Obligations and (ii) any prepayment and
other related fees and expenses in connection with prepayment of Debt
Obligations contemplated hereby.

6.20  _Notice of Material Adverse Change_. The Company will give prompt
written notice to Buyers of any event, occurrence or development arising since
the date hereof that has had a Material Adverse Effect.

 

6.21 _Guarantee_. Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees
to the Sellers the prompt and full discharge by Operating Buyer of all of
Operating Buyers covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities under
this Agreement including the due and punctual payment of all amounts which are
or may become due and payable by Operating Buyer hereunder when and as
the same shall become due and payable (collectively, the "Operating Buyer
Obligations"), in accordance with the terms hereof. Guarantor acknowledges and
agrees that, with respect to all Operating Buyer Obligations to pay money,
such guaranty shall be a guaranty of payment and performance and not of
collection and shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit of any
remedies against Operating Buyer. If Operating Buyer shall default in the due
and punctual performance of any Operating Buyer Obligation, including the
full and timely payment of any amount due and payable pursuant to any
Operating Buyer Obligation, Guarantor will forthwith perform or cause to be
performed such Operating Buyer Obligation and will forthwith make full
payment of any amount due with respect thereto at its sole cost and expense.

11.03 _Third Party Claims_. __

 

The obligations and liabilities of an Indemnifying Party with respect to
Losses resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties (each, a
"Third Party Claim") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

(a) The Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice to the
Indemnifying Party of any Third Party Claim that might give rise to any Loss
by the Indemnified Party, stating the nature and basis of such Third Party
Claim, and the amount thereof to the extent known; provided, however, that no
delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying
Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.
Such notice shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with
respect to such Third Party Claim, including any summons, complaint or other
pleading which may have been served, any written demand or any other document
or instrument.

 



84 __(b) From and after receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim pursuant to
Section 11.03(a), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and
conduct, at its own expense, the defense against the Third Party Claim in its
own name or in the name of the Indemnified Party with counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party if the Indemnifying Party has, based on
the facts and circumstances available at the time, unconditionally
acknowledged in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party in
respect of such Third Party Claim in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement and without prejudice to the amount of any Loss. Any
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
Third Party Claim and/or to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall not be included as part of any Loss
incurred by the Indemnified Party and shall not be payable by the Indemnifying
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the representation of any such
Indemnified Party by the same counsel as the Indemnifying Party would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of profession conduct, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to appoint one separate counsel for such
claims and defenses, at the reasonable cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party. The party or parties conducting the defense of any Third Party Claim
shall keep the other parties apprised of all significant developments with
respect thereto and shall not enter into any settlement, compromise or consent
to judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior consent
of the other parties thereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
settle, compromise or consent to a judgment without the consent of the
Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party Claim that only imposes
monetary obligations that are paid by the Indemnifying Party and contains a
release of the Indemnified Party from all liability thereunder. The
Indemnified Party shall make available all information and assistance for the
defense of the Third Party Claim as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request and shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense. __

__(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Buyer determines in good faith that
an adverse determination with respect to a Third Party Claim would reasonably
be expected to be materially detrimental to the future business prospects or
operations of the Operating Entities, taken as a whole, or Platform Entities,
taken as a whole, such Buyer may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume
the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any compromise or
settlement effected without its consent. __

 



85 11.04 _Limitations on Indemnification_. __

 

(a) As to any claim for Warranty Breach (other than with respect to a claim
for a breach or inaccuracy of a Fundamental Representation or a Company
Approval Breach), or for indemnification by the Sellers for all matters
pursuant to Sections 9.02(a), 9.02(b) and the last sentence of Section 9.03
the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification (i) with
respect to any Loss or a series of related Losses for less than $100,000 and
(ii) until all Losses (including any de minimis Loss excluded pursuant to the
foregoing clause (i)) to such Indemnified Party exceed, in the aggregate, an
amount equal to $10,000,000 and then only to the extent of such excess.

(b) With respect to indemnification by the Sellers for all matters under
this Agreement, Buyers hereby agree that the sole recourse of the Indemnified
Parties in respect of all such matters shall be, subject to Section 2.04(j)
and this Section 11.04(b), a right of set-off against up to $100,000,000 of
Earnout Project Payments, if any (the "Cap") in accordance with Section
2.04(j), and the Indemnified Parties shall have no right to seek payment
directly from the Sellers in respect of any such matters; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the remedies available to any
Party for any breaches of Fundamental Representations and _provided further_
that with respect to indemnification by Sellers for (1) all matters pursuant
to Sections 3.09, 9.02(a), 9.02(b) and the last sentence of Section 9.03 (the
"Tax Claims") such right of set-off shall be the exclusive remedy provided
that the Cap shall be increased by $50,000,000 solely with respect to Tax
Claims and (2) the Company Approval Breaches, the maximum set off shall be
equal to $10,000,000 (which amount shall be included in and not increase the
Cap) and such right of set-off shall be the exclusive remedy for such Company
Approval Breaches. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall the aggregate amount paid by any Seller in respect of any claims
hereunder exceed (i) such Sellers pro rata portion of such indemnifiable
claim (limited as provided in this Article XI) based on the allocation of the
Holdco Closing Consideration set forth in the Allocation Schedule (provided
that with respect to Warranty Breaches under Article IV, such Seller shall be
liable, subject to this Article XI, for the full amount of any claim
attributable to a breach by such Seller, but no other Seller shall be liable
for any amount of any claim attributable to such breach; it being understood
that Blocker Parent is solely responsible for the full amount of any claim for
breach of Section 4.06) or (ii) the aggregate amount of proceeds received by
such Seller hereunder as of the date of such claim; provided, however, that in
the event the applicable portion of a claim that is timely and properly made
and for which such Seller is liable to indemnify a Buyer Indemnitee, in each
case under the provisions of this Article XI, exceeds the aggregate amount of
proceeds received by such Seller on the date of such claim, any proceeds
received by such Seller hereunder after the date of such claim may be used to
satisfy such Sellers unsatisfied indemnification obligation with respect to
such claim.

 

(c) In no event shall a Buyer be liable for any Losses as to any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02(b)(i) with respect to Fundamental
Representations or Section 11.02(b)(ii) in excess of an amount equal to 100%
of the Total Purchase Price paid by Buyers as of such date.

 



86 (d) Solely for the purposes of this Article XI, from and after Closing any
reference to "material", "materially" or "Material Adverse Effect" in any
representation or warranty (other than those representations and warranties in
Sections 3.01(a), 3.03, 3.05(a), 3.08, 3.10(b), 3.13(a)) shall be
disregarded solely for purposes of determining the amount of Losses
attributable to any Warranty Breach, and for purposes of determining whether
there has actually been a Warranty Breach.

 

(e) Buyers and the Sellers on behalf of each of their respective Indemnified
Parties waives any right to recover incidental, indirect, special, exemplary,
punitive or consequential damages, unless such incidental, indirect, special,
exemplary, punitive, consequential or other kind of special damages are
awarded to a Person in an indemnifiable Third Party Claim.

 

(f) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder or otherwise to
reimbursement for Losses in connection with the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Losses upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or
recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith. If such Indemnified Party
mitigates its Losses after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified
Party under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that
loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the
Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified
Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Partys reasonable costs of
mitigation) within two Business Days after the benefit is received, but such
payment shall not exceed the indemnity payment paid by the Indemnifying Party.

(g) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect any amounts available under insurance coverage for any Losses payable
under Section 11.02(a) or 11.02(b).

 

(h) Any Losses as to an indemnifiable claim with respect to any breach or
nonperformance by a Party of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement shall be calculated without reduction for any Tax Benefit available
to the Indemnified Party. However, to the extent that the Indemnified Party
actually realizes a Tax Benefit as a result of any Loss in any taxable year
in which or prior to which such Loss was incurred, the Indemnified Party
shall pay the amount of such Tax Benefit (but not in excess of the
indemnification payment or payments actually received from the Indemnifying
Party with respect to such Loss) to the Indemnifying Party as such Tax
Benefit is actually realized by the Indemnified Party. For this purpose, the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to realize a tax benefit ("Tax Benefit")
with respect to a taxable year if, and to the extent that, the Indemnified
Partys cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year,
calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to the Loss from all
taxable years, exceeds the Indemnified Partys actual cumulative liability
for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into
account any Tax items attributable to the Loss for all taxable years (to the
extent permitted by relevant Tax law and treating such Tax items as the
last items claimed for any taxable year).

 



87 (i) Any indemnifiable claim with respect to any breach or nonperformance by a
Party of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be net of
any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party or amounts actually
recovered from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor (net of any
costs of collection, increased premium or other out-of-pocket costs related
to the insurance claim or third party recovery in respect of Losses). If the
Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or
from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party
(net of any costs of collection, increased premium or other out-of-pocket
costs related to the insurance claim or third party recovery in respect of
Losses).

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Sellers
will not be responsible for, and will not be required to indemnify any
Indemnified Person against, any Losses to the extent (but only to such extent)
that such Losses are otherwise included in the calculation of Adjusted
Unlevered CAFD for the purpose of determining any CAFD Shortfall Amount under
Section 2.06 or are Transaction Expenses that were deducted from the Holdco
Total Purchase Price or the Operating Entities Total Purchase Price.

 

11.05 _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives any payment
from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to Section
11.02(a) or 11.02(b) and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a
part of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on
the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment; _provided_ that in
exercising these rights, the Indemnifying Party shall consult in good faith
with the Indemnified Party.

11.06 _Remedies Exclusive_. The indemnification rights of the Parties under
this Article XI are the exclusive remedies after the Closing available to the
Parties and any Indemnified Party with respect to any claims or disputes
arising with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other
than claims involving fraud, with respect to which the Parties rights and
remedies shall not be affected or diminished hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained herein shall affect (i) the rights of the Parties
under Section 12.13 with respect to any covenants to be performed after the
Closing, (ii) the Sellers rights to contribution or other rights of recovery
under or relating to any Environmental Law or (iii) the rights of Buyers
under Section 2.06 with respect to any CAFD Shortfall Amount. After the
Closing Date, no Party may seek the rescission of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

11.07 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Financing Sources (in their capacity as such) shall not have
any liability to the Company, Operating Seller, Blocker Parent, the Company
Sellers or any of their

 



88  respective equity holders, representatives or Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the financing of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Financing") or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort or otherwise, and the
Company, Operating Seller, Blocker Parent, the Company Sellers and their
respective equity holders, representatives and Affiliates shall not have any
rights or claims, and shall not seek any loss or damage or any other recovery
or judgment of any kind, including direct, indirect, consequential, special,
exemplary or punitive damages, against any Financing Source (in its capacity
as such) under this Agreement or the Financing, whether at law or equity, in
contract or in tort or otherwise.

other Parties, which such Parties may withhold in their discretion.

 

(b) Each Buyer may assign this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates
provided that such assignment shall not relieve such Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of another
Party hereunder.

12.11 _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument and any of the Parties
may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This Agreement
shall become effective when each Buyer, the Company, Operating Seller, Blocker
Parent, the Sellers Representative and Company Members with a right to
receive at least 95% of the Holdco Purchase Price shall have received
a counterpart hereof signed by the other Parties hereto. Until and unless
each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Parties
hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right
or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). If required in order to satisfy the
condition set forth in Section 7.01(k), Sponsors will exercise their drag
along rights pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement
of the Company (as amended from time to time) and take all reasonable actions
to enforce such rights. In the event that prior to Closing the Sellers
Representative notifies Buyers that in order to satisfy the condition set
forth in Section 7.01(k) it is desirable to effect the purchase of Company
Interests by way of merger, the Parties shall, while preserving the rights and
obligations of the Parties hereto, make such amendments to the terms of
this Agreement as are required to give effect to a merger. No provision of
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided that Section
6.10 (and the survival of such Section pursuant to Section 10.02), 6.12, 6.13,
6.14, 11.07, 12.06, 12.14, 12.15 and 12.16 and this Section 12.11 are intended
to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Persons named therein.
After the date hereof, any Company Member who has not executed this Agreement
on the date hereof, shall, upon execution and delivery to Buyers and the
Sellers Representative of a form of joinder pursuant to which
it acknowledges and consents to this Agreement and agrees to be bound by the
terms and conditions applicable to a Seller hereunder, shall be treated as a
Seller for all purposes under this Agreement.

 

12.12 _Disclosure_. The Company has set forth information on the Disclosure
Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it

 



93  relates. Information disclosed in any Disclosure Schedule shall constitute a
disclosure for purposes of all other Disclosure Schedules notwithstanding the
lack of specific cross-reference thereto, but only to the extent the
applicability of such disclosure to such other Schedule is reasonably apparent
on its face. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Disclosure
Schedule may include certain items and information solely for informational
purposes for the convenience of Buyers and (b) the disclosure by the Company
of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment by the Company that the matter is required to be disclosed by
the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

12.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, money damages
would not be a sufficient remedy and that the Parties shall be entitled
to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement and immediate
injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.

 

12.14 _Governing Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO
CONTRACTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED IN THAT STATE.

12.15 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. __

 

(a) For all purposes of this Agreement, and for all purposes of any Action
arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, each Party submits to the personal
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the federal courts of
the United States sitting in New York County, and hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that any such Action may be heard and determined
in such New York court or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such
federal court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any such Action may
be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any Party may otherwise have to bring any Action relating to this
Agreement against the other Parties or their properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

(b) Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so:

(i) any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter
in any New York state or federal court located in New York County; and

 

(ii) the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in
any such court.

 



94 (c) Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process by registered mail,
return receipt requested, as provided in Section 12.07. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Applicable Law.

 

(d) Each Party agrees that it will not (and will cause its Affiliates not to)
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any forum other than the federal and New
York State courts located in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan (and
appellate courts thereof).

 

12.16 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THAT
OTHERWISE RELATES TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION AGAINST ANY
FINANCING SOURCES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

12.17 _Sellers  Representative_. __

 

(a) The Sellers Representative is hereby appointed as the representative of
the Sellers and as the attorney-in-fact, proxy and agent for and on behalf of
each such Seller for purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and
shall be empowered to take the following actions under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement: (i) all actions and making all filings on behalf of the
Sellers with any Governmental Authority or other Person necessary to effect
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, (ii) agreeing to, negotiating, entering into settlements
and compromises of, complying with orders of courts with respect to, and
otherwise administering and handling any claims under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, (iii) negotiating and executing any waivers or amendments of
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (provided, that any amendment that
shall adversely and disproportionally affect the rights or obligations of any
Seller as compared to other Sellers shall require the prior written consent of
such Seller) and (iv) all other actions that are either necessary or
appropriate in its judgment for the accomplishment of the foregoing or
contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The
Sellers Representative hereby accepts such appointment. Each of the Sellers
agrees that such attorney-in-fact, proxy and agency and all authority granted
hereunder are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the
consent of the Sellers Representative and shall survive the
death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Seller. If,
after the execution of this Agreement, any Seller dies, dissolves or
liquidates or becomes incapacitated or incompetent, then the Sellers
Representative is nevertheless authorized, empowered and directed to act in
accordance with this Agreement as if that death, dissolution, liquidation,
incapacity or incompetency had not occurred and regardless of notice thereof.

 



95 (b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative
hereunder shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all
Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller, and the
Escrow Agent, and Buyers may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Sellers Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each and every Seller. The Escrow Agent and Buyers
shall be relieved from any liability to any Seller for any acts done by them
in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers
Representative.

(c) The Sellers Representative shall incur no liability with respect to any
action taken or suffered by any party in reliance upon any notice, direction,
instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by the Sellers
Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper person (and
the Sellers Representative shall have no responsibility to determine the
authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction, except its own
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. In all questions arising
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Sellers Representative may
rely on the advice of outside counsel, and the Sellers Representative shall
not be liable to any Seller for anything done, omitted or suffered in good
faith by the Sellers Representative based on such advice.

(d) The Sponsors shall, severally (each limited to its pro rata share based on
the Allocation Schedule) but not jointly, indemnify the Sellers
Representative and hold harmless the Sellers Representative from and against
any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct, on the part of the Sellers Representative and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Sellers
Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses
of any legal counsel or other agents retained by the Sellers Representative.

(e) At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, the Sponsors, acting
jointly, may, by written consent, appoint a new representative as the
Sellers Representative. Notice, together with a copy of the written consent
appointing such new representative and bearing the signature of each Sponsor,
must be delivered to Buyers and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent not less
than ten (10) days prior to such appointment. Such appointment shall be
effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such
consent is received by Buyers and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent. Until
such notice is received, Buyers shall be entitled to rely on the actions and
statements of the previous Sellers Representative.

 

(f) In the event that the Sellers Representative becomes unable or unwilling
to continue in its capacity as the Sellers Representative, or if the
Sellers Representative resigns as the Sellers Representative, the Sponsors,
acting jointly, may, by written consent, appoint a new representative as the
Sellers Representative. Notice and a copy of the written consent appointing
such new representative and bearing the signature of each Sponsor must be
delivered to Buyers and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent. Such appointment
shall be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the
date such consent is received by Buyers and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent.
Until such notice is received, Buyers shall be entitled to rely on the actions
and statements of the previous Sellers Representative.
