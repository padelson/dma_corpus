ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time, and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease in accordance with the
provisions of the DGCL. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger and shall continue to exist as said surviving corporation under its
present name pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL. The separate corporate
existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in the DGCL. From and  



 

2  after the Effective Time, the Company is sometimes referred to herein as the
" _Surviving Corporation_."

1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) as expeditiously as possible but no later
than the fifth Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date) set forth in Article VI (the " _Closing Date_ "), unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The
Closing shall be held at the offices of Morrison and Foerster LLP, 1290 Avenue
of the Americas, New York, New York 10104, unless another place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto.

1.3. _Effective Time_. As part of the Closing, the parties hereto shall (a)
file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form
as is required by and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and (b) make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger
is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall agree and be specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being
the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
will have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties
of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties
of the Surviving Corporation.

1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Certificate of
Incorporation_ ") until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and
under applicable law.

1.6. _Bylaws_. The bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein and under applicable law.

1.7. _Officers and Directors of Surviving Corporation_. The officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The parties hereto
shall take all requisite action so that the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified.

1.8.  _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:



 

3 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock

Consideration, the Per Share Holdback Consideration as contemplated by Section

without interest (except interest on any escrowed funds) and subject to
adjustment as contemplated hereby, including Sections 2.1(c), 2.9(d) and 8.3.

(b)  _Conversion of Company Preferred Stock_. Each share of Company Preferred

Effective Time, the Company shall provide notice (subject to prior reasonable
review by Parent) to each holder of Company Options describing the treatment
of such Company Options in accordance with this Section 1.8(f).

1.9. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time held by holders who shall have properly exercised their
appraisal rights with respect thereto under Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled only to such rights as
may be granted to them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, except that each Dissenting Share held by a holder who shall thereafter
withdraw his or her demand for appraisal or shall fail to perfect or otherwise
waive or lose his or her right to such payment as provided in such Section 262
shall be deemed to be converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to
receive the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest
(except interest on any escrowed funds), in the form such holder otherwise
would have been entitled to receive as a result of the Merger. The Company
will enforce any contractual waivers that holders of Company Common Stock have
granted regarding appraisal rights that would apply to the Merger. The Company

2.1. _Exchange Agent; Payment Funds_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company,

(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the exchange and payment of the Merger
Consideration.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Stock and
Company Options, an amount in cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant
to Section 2.2 (other than the Holdback Consideration, which shall be
deposited by Parent with the Escrow Agent at or prior to the Effective Time,
and the Stockholder Representative Expense Amount, which shall be deposited by
Parent with the Stockholder Representative at or prior to the Effective
Time). Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section
2.1(b) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Stockholder Representative for the benefit of the Stockholder Representative,
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Options, as their
interests may appear, an amount equal to the Stockholder Representative
Expense Amount. The Stockholder Representative Expense Amount shall be used by
the Stockholder Representative to fund the Stockholder Representatives
expenses in the performance of its duties as the Stockholder Representative.
To the extent any portion of the Stockholder Representative Expense Amount is
not so utilized on or prior to the three year anniversary of the Closing Date
or is not expected to be so utilized, within ten (10) Business Days after the
forty-second month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver any remaining portion of the Stockholder
Representative Expense Amount to the holders of shares Company Common Stock
and Company Options in proportion to their respective holdings of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Options, as the case may be, at the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative
may in its sole discretion, deliver at any time any portion of the Stockholder
Representative Expense Amount to the holders of shares Company Common Stock
and Company Options in proportion to their respective holdings of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Options, as the case may be, at the Effective
Time.

2.2. _Exchange Procedures_.



 

6 (a) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to, deliver to each record holder of a Certificate (a) a
letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be
substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree, and (b) instructions for effecting the surrender of such
Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Closing Common Merger
Consideration, Preferred Per Share Merger Consideration and the right to the
Per Share Holdback Consideration and the Per Share Stockholder Representative
Expense Amount, as applicable. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange
Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor the
Per Share Closing Common Merger Consideration or the Preferred Per Share
Merger Consideration, as applicable (less any required withholding of Taxes in
accordance with Section 2.2(b)) for each share of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, formerly represented by such
Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. Any Person entitled
to a portion of the Closing Merger Consideration who has provided wire
instructions to the Exchange Agent no later than one (1) Business Day prior to
the Effective Time shall be entitled to payments of the Closing Merger
Consideration by wire transfer on the Closing Date in accordance with the
instructions specified in such Persons Letter of Transmittal. No interest
will be paid or will accrue for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on
the Closing Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration may be
made with respect to such Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock to
such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid or are not applicable.

(b) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any Merger Consideration payable under
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under (i) the Code or (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign
Tax laws and shall thereafter pay all such amounts so deducted or withheld to
the proper taxing authorities. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

2.3.  _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Closing Merger
Consideration paid upon conversion of shares of Company Stock in accordance
with the terms of Article I and this Article II and the right to the Holdback
Consideration as contemplated by Section 8.3 and the Stockholder
Representative Expense Amount as contemplated by Section 2.1(c) shall be
deemed to have been paid and given in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Stock. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered prior to one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect to such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property or any Governmental Authority), any such cash shall, to
the  



 

7  extent permitted by applicable law, be delivered to and become property of
the Surviving Corporation. If, no later than eighteen (18) months after
the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II.
If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the
date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise become subject to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law, the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, on the Business Day immediately prior to such date become the property of
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

2.4. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund constituting the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates after one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Effective Time (including any interest thereon) shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving
Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation and Parent for the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Stock formerly represented thereby to which
such holders are entitled pursuant to Sections 1.8 and 2.2 (other than any
distribution of the remainder of the Stockholder Representative
Expense Amount for which such holder shall look only to the Stockholder
Representative).

2.5. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund properly paid from the
Exchange Fund or delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

2.6. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub (if such affidavit is
accepted before the Effective Time) or the Surviving Corporation (if such
affidavit is accepted after the Effective Time), and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such form and
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably require as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation
with respect to the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Stock formerly represented thereby in the
manner set forth in Sections 1.8 and 2.2.

2.7. _Stock Transfer Books_. Upon and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock thereafter on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Stock formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by
law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be canceled and exchanged for
the applicable Per Share Merger  



 

8  Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Stock formerly
represented thereby in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

2.8. _Debt and Working Capital Estimate_. No later than six (6) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
good faith estimate of (x) Debt as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (" _Estimated Debt_ ") and (y) Working Capital as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (" _Estimated Working Capital_ "), together with
(i) a statement of the calculation of Estimated Debt and Estimated Working
Capital and (ii) a certificate signed by the Company to the effect that
Estimated Debt and Estimated Working Capital were determined in good faith in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ "). The parties agree that Estimated Debt shall be adjusted as
necessary on or prior to the Closing Date to reflect the actual payoff
amounts with respect to those components of Estimated Debt for which payoff
information has been received by the Company from the applicable creditors as
of the Closing Date. Parent shall have five (5) Business Days to review
the Estimated Closing Statement and the calculations set forth therein and
during such time the Company shall make its senior financial officers
reasonably available to answer any questions of Parent regarding the
preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement. Parent shall have the right
to reasonably object to the Estimated Closing Statement within such five (5)
Business Day period, by delivering to the Company (i) a statement describing
its objections and setting forth Parents estimate of the Estimated Working
Capital and the Estimated Debt and (ii) a certificate signed by the Parent to
the effect that the Parents calculations of Estimated Working Capital and the
Estimated Debt were determined in good faith, in light of the information
available to it, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Parent
and the Stockholder Representative will use good faith efforts to resolve any
dispute regarding the determination of the Estimated Working Capital and/or
the Estimated Debt on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , that in the
event that the parties are not able to resolve the computation of the
Estimated Working Capital and/or the Estimated Debt on or prior to such time
and the aggregate amount of Parents objections to the Estimated Closing
Statement is Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) or less, then the Estimated
Working Capital and/or the Estimated Debt will be deemed to be equal to the
average of Parents and the Stockholder Representatives determinations
thereof as provided hereunder, as applicable; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
the aggregate amount of Parents objections to the Estimated Closing Statement
exceeds Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), then the Estimated Working Capital
and/or the Estimated Debt will be deemed to be equal to the average of
Parents and the Stockholder Representatives determinations thereof as
provided hereunder, as applicable, and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 2.9(c), when, in connection with the adjustment provisions
set forth in Section 2.9, the Estimated Closing Statement and Parents
objections are submitted to the Arbiter for review and resolution, fees,
costs and expenses of the Arbiter shall be borne completely by the party whose
estimated amounts had the greater deviation (whether positive or negative)
from the final resolution of such amounts by the Arbiter.

2.9. _Closing Statement; Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be prepared and shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative
a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "), setting forth in reasonable detail
(i) Working Capital as of the close of  



 

9  business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Working Capital_ ") and (ii)
Debt as of the close of business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Debt_
"), in each case, of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, which
shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP Consistently Applied. The
Closing Statement shall be accompanied by an accountants report issued by
PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP or another internationally recognized third party
accounting firm selected by Parent, in its sole discretion, to the effect that
the Closing Statement has been reviewed by it and that the Closing
Statement has been prepared in accordance with GAAP Consistently Applied.

(b) Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholder Representative
and Parent agrees that it will, and it will use reasonable efforts to cause
its respective agents and representatives to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing Date
Working Capital and the Closing Date Debt and in the conduct of the reviews
and dispute resolution process referred to in this Section 2.9.

(c) During the twenty (20)-day period following the Stockholder
Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, the Stockholder
Representative and its independent accountants shall, at the Stockholder
Representatives expense, be permitted to review, and the Surviving
Corporation shall make available to the Stockholder Representative, the
supporting schedules, analyses, working papers and other documentation of the
Surviving Corporation and its independent accountant (with respect to working
papers, subject to the execution and delivery by the
Stockholder Representative and its independent accountants and other agents
of customary confidentiality undertakings, waivers, releases and
indemnification in favor of such independent accountant) relating to the
Closing Statement and to ask questions, receive answers and request such
other data and information from its senior financial officers and its
independent accountants as shall be reasonably related to the adjustment to
the Merger Consideration contemplated by this Section 2.9. The
Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties at 5:00
p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day following the 20th day following
delivery thereof (and the Working Capital amount reflected therein shall be
deemed to be Final Working Capital and the Debt amount reflected therein shall
be deemed to be Final Debt), unless the Stockholder Representative gives
written notice of its disagreement with the Closing Statement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to the Surviving Corporation prior to such time. Any Notice
of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement so asserted. Parent, at its expense, shall be permitted to review
the supporting schedules, analyses, working papers and other documentation
with respect to such Notice of Disagreement (with respect to working
papers, subject to the execution and delivery by Parent and its independent
accountants and other agents of customary confidentiality undertakings,
waivers, releases and indemnification in favor of such independent
accountant). Except for such items that are specifically disputed in the
Notice of Disagreement, the amounts set forth on the Closing Statement shall
be final.

During the 15-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement
or such longer period as the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
mutually agree, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and in the event that
the Stockholder Representative and Parent are able to reach such resolution,
then the amount so agreed by them in writing shall be deemed to be Final  



 

10  Working Capital and/or Final Debt, as the case may be. If, at the end of
such 15-day period (or such longer period as mutually agreed between the
Stockholder Representative and Parent), the Stockholder Representative and
Parent have not so resolved such differences, the Stockholder Representative
and Parent shall submit the dispute for resolution to an independent
accounting firm (the " _Arbiter_ ") for review and resolution of any and all
matters which remain in dispute and which were included in the Notice of
Disagreement in accordance with this Section 2.9. The Arbiter shall be a
mutually acceptable internationally recognized independent public accounting
firm agreed upon by the Stockholder Representative and Parent in writing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the parties are not able to
mutually agree on an accounting firm, the Arbiter shall be Deloitte and Touche
LLP. The Stockholder Representative and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to
cause the Arbiter to render a decision resolving the matters in dispute within
thirty (30) days following the submission of such matters to the Arbiter, or
such longer period as the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall mutually
agree. The Stockholder Representative and Parent agree that the determination
of the Arbiter shall be final and binding upon the parties and that judgment
may be entered upon the determination of the Arbiter in any court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The Arbiter shall determine, based solely on presentations by
the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Stockholder Representative and
their respective representatives, and not by independent review, only those
issues in dispute specifically set forth on the Notice of Disagreement and
shall prepare the Final Closing Statement and render a written report as to
the dispute and the resulting calculation of Closing Date Working Capital
and/or Closing Date Debt, as appropriate, which shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties as Final Working Capital and Final Debt,
respectively. In resolving any disputed item, the Arbiter: (i) shall be bound
by the principles set forth in this Section 2.9 (including that Closing Date
Working Capital and Closing Date Debt be determined in accordance with GAAP
Consistently Applied), (ii) shall limit its review to matters specifically set
forth in the Notice of Disagreement and (iii) shall not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. Except as
provided in the second proviso of the last sentence of Section 2.8, with
regard to the payment of the Arbiters fees for resolving differences
with regard to the Estimated Closing Statement, the fees, costs and expenses
of the Arbiter (x) shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items so
submitted that are successfully disputed by the Stockholder Representative
(as finally determined by the Arbiter) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of
such items so submitted and (y) shall be borne by holders of Company Common
Stock and Company Options in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount
of such disputed items so submitted that are unsuccessfully disputed by the
Stockholder Representative (as finally determined by the Arbiter) bears to the
aggregate dollar amount of such items so submitted. The fees and expenses of
the Surviving Corporation and Parent incurred in connection with the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the review of any Notice of
Disagreement shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation, and the fees and
expenses of the Stockholder Representatives independent accountants incurred
in connection with their review of the Closing Statement shall be borne by the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options.

(d) Upon determination of Final Working Capital and Final Debt, the Common
Stock Merger Consideration shall be further adjusted as follows:

 



 

11 (i) If Final Working Capital is greater than the High Reference Amount, then
the Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be increased (if the amount
calculated under this clause (i) is positive) or decreased (if the amount
calculated under this clause (i) is negative), dollar-for-dollar by the amount
equal to (x) the amount by which Final Working Capital exceeds the High
Reference Amount, _minus_ (y) the Positive EWC Adjustment, _plus_ (z) the
Negative EWC Adjustment;

(ii) If Final Working Capital is less than the Low Reference Amount, then the
Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be increased (if the amount calculated
under this clause (ii) is positive) or decreased (if the amount calculated
under this clause (ii) is negative), dollar-for-dollar by the amount equal to
(xx) the Negative EWC Adjustment, _minus_ (yy) the Positive EWC Adjustment,
_minus_ (zz) the amount by which the Low Reference Amount exceeds Final
Working Capital;

(iii) If Final Working Capital is equal to or less than the High Reference
Amount and equal to or greater than the Low Reference Amount, then the Common
Stock Merger Consideration shall be increased (if the amount calculated under
this clause (iii) is positive) or decreased (if the amount calculated under
this clause (iii) is negative), dollar-for-dollar by the amount equal to the
Negative EWC Adjustment, _minus_ the Positive EWC Adjustment;

(iv) The Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be increased dollar-for-
dollar by the amount, if any, by which Estimated Debt exceeds Final Debt; and

(v) The Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar
by the amount, if any, by which Final Debt exceeds Estimated Debt.

(e) The cumulative net adjustment to the Common Stock Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.9(d) above, whether a net increase or reduction, is the
" _Final Adjustment Amount_." Within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing
Statement becomes final and binding upon the parties, (i) if the net effect
pursuant to this Section 2.9 is an increase in the Common Stock Merger
Consideration, Parent shall make a cash payment equal to the Final Adjustment
Amount to the Exchange Agent, to be distributed pro rata to each holder of
Company Common Stock or Company Options held by such holder immediately prior
to the Effective Time, such further cash payments to be made to (A) each
holder of Company Common Stock in an amount equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Adjustment Consideration and (B)
each holder of Company Option in an amount equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company
Option held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the Per Share Adjustment Consideration, and (ii) if the net effect pursuant
hereto is a reduction in the Common Stock Merger Consideration, each holder of
Company Common Stock and each holder of Company Options, shall, by virtue
of payments by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Fund in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, be deemed to have made a payment to the
Surviving Corporation to an account designated in writing by the Surviving
Corporation, by wire transfer in immediately available funds, of the amount
of such Final Adjustment Amount, in either case under clause (i) or (ii) of
this Section 2.9(e), together with interest thereon from the  



 

12  Closing Date to the date of actual payment at a variable rate equal to the
prime rate (as reported in the _Wall Street Journal (National Edition) "Money
Rates_ ") from and including the Closing Date to, but not including, the date
of payment. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto herby
confirms that each of the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent is authorized
and instructed to make any of the payments provided for in this Section
2.9(e), in the case of the Exchange Agent, upon receipt of funds so designated
from Parent, and, in the case of the Escrow Agent, upon written instructions
from Parent and the Stockholder Representative in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

2.10. _Withholding Taxes_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts, if any, as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law or
under any applicable law and shall thereafter pay all such amounts so deducted
or withheld to the proper taxing or other Governmental Authorities. Any such
amounts shall be withheld or deducted from the purchase price payable pursuant
to this Agreement, and such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the relevant Person.

Working Capital) that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the
account of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options, and Parent
shall cause the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, to pay over to the
such holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options the amount of any

shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to carry back to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all federal, state and local
net operating losses of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising in a Pre-

of Taxes in a Pre-Closing Tax Period by the Company and its Subsidiaries and
to the extent permissible by applicable law, Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
reasonably promptly apply for, obtain and pay over to the Stockholder

preparation and application for such refund.

Subsidiaries, in each case, that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, that would cause an increase in the Taxes
of the Company or its Subsidiaries for which the holders of Company Common
Stock or Company Options or both are required to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified

the Stockholder Representative, which shall not be unreasonably delayed,

7.1(b) shall not be available to any party who has failed to comply with any
obligation under this Agreement and such failure has been the primary cause
of the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the Termination
Date;

(c) By either the Company or Parent, if any Governmental Authority shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken or issued a public statement
threatening to take any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply
with Section 5.2 has been the primary cause of such action or inaction;

(d) By Parent, if neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in material breach of
its obligations under this Agreement, and if (i) at any time that any of the
representations and warranties of the Company herein become untrue or
inaccurate such that the conditions contained in Section 6.2(a) would not be
satisfied or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of the Company of any
of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that the
conditions contained in Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied, and, in both
case (i) and case (ii), such breach (if curable) has not been cured within
thirty (30) days after notice to the Company;

(e) By the Company, if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement, and if (i) at any time that any of the representations and
warranties of Parent or Merger Sub herein become untrue or inaccurate such
that the conditions contained in Section 6.3(a) would not be satisfied or
(ii) there has been a breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub of any of
their respective covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that
the conditions contained in Section 6.3(b) would not be satisfied, and, in
both case (i) and case (ii), such breach (if curable) has not been cured
within thirty (30) days after notice to Parent; or

(f) By Parent, if

(i) either the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of
FastenTech fails to provide the certifications required under Section 302 or
Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to any Annual
Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of FastenTech at the
time such report is required to be filed under the Exchange Act.; or

(ii) if there is any restatement of FastenTechs consolidated financial
statements or any material change in FastenTechs previously announced
financial results after the date of this Agreement.

7.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of Parent or the Company or their respective officers or directors;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for the willful breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement arising prior
to such termination. The provisions of  



 

53  Sections 5.2(e), 5.4 and 5.8 and this Section 7.2 and Article IX shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

7.3. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive
compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party to assert any
of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, and no
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof by any party. The waiver by
any party of any breach of this Agreement, or the failure of any party to
require the performance or satisfaction of any term or obligation of this
Agreement, shall not prevent subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation
or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach.

ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION; ESCROW

8.1. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_.
The representations and warranties and covenants (other than the covenants in
this Article VIII and Sections 5.5, 5.8 and 5.11, which shall survive in
accordance with their respective terms) made by the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub in this Agreement (including, the representations and warranties set
forth in Article III hereof and the representations and warranties set forth
in any certificate delivered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with this Agreement) shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
full force and effect and shall survive until the applicable Survival Period.

8.2. _Claims_.

 

(a) _Claims Against Holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options_. From
and after the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
their respective Subsidiaries and each of its respective directors, officers,
employees, shareholders, successors, permitted assigns, owners, agents and
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Persons_ ") will
be entitled to make a claim against the Escrow Fund, and only against the
Escrow Fund, pursuant to the terms of this Article VIII, for, any loss,
liability, claim, damage, fine, penalty, fee, cost or expense (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses, but excluding consequential damages
(other than consequential damages paid or payable to third parties),
diminution in value or lost profits) (" _Damages_ ") which are suffered or
incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Person or to which any Buyer Indemnified
Person may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages
relate to any third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of:



 

54 (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the
Company in connection with this Agreement;

(ii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company contained in
this Agreement requiring performance prior to the Closing;

(iii) any and all Taxes which are imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of its income, business, property or operations or for
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable (1) for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period or (2) resulting by reason of the several
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Treasury
Regulations section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or foreign law or
regulation or by reason of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having been
a member of any consolidated, combined or unitary group on or prior to the
Closing Date; or

(iv) any decrease in the Common Stock Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.9;

_provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum liability of the holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Options as a group for Damages in respect of any
claim or claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall not exceed the
amount of the Holdback Consideration (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event will any Buyer Indemnified Person assert a claim
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i), unless (i) the monetary value of all Damages
suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to any individual
matter or series of related matters exceeds Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)
(the " _Mini-Basket_ ") and (ii) the cumulative total of the Damages suffered
by the Buyer Indemnified Persons exceeds Two Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($2,500,000) (the " _Basket_ ", whereupon such Buyer Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to make a claim for indemnity hereunder only for all
Damages in excess of the Basket. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 8.2(a), the Basket shall not apply to (A) any claims under
Sections 8.2(a)(ii), 8.2 (a)(iii) and 8.2(a)(iv); (B) to the Extended
Representations other than the representations and warranties of the Company
in Section 3.1(r); or (C) to the representations and warranties of the
Company in the second sentence of Section 3.1(k)(i).

In the case of any representation or warranty, except with respect to
representations and warranties of the Company in Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b),
3.1(i)(A), 3.1(j) and 3.1(n), that is limited by "material," "Material Adverse
Effect" or by any similar term or limitation, the occurrence of a breach or
inaccuracy of such representation or warranty, as the case may be, and the
amount of Damages subject to indemnification hereunder shall be determined as
if "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or such similar term or limitation
were not included therein.

(b) _Indemnification by Parent_. From and after the Closing Date, Parent
(the " _Seller Indemnifying Person_ ") shall hold harmless and indemnify the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options and, in the case of any
entity, each of its respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders,
successors, permitted assigns, owners, agents and Affiliates (collectively,
the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ " and, together with the Buyer Indemnified
Persons, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") and shall hold each of them harmless
from and  



 

55  against, and shall compensate and reimburse any Seller Indemnified Person
for, any Damages which are suffered or incurred by any Seller Indemnified
Person or to which any Seller Indemnified Person may otherwise become subject
(regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third-party claim)
and which arise from or as a result of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement;

(ii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or any covenant or obligation of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation requiring performance after the Closing; or

(iii) any increase in the Common Stock Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.9;

_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will any Seller Indemnified Person
assert a claim under Section 8.2(b)(i) unless the cumulative total of the
Damages suffered by the Seller Indemnified Persons exceeds the Basket,
whereupon such Seller Indemnified Person shall be entitled to make a claim
for indemnity hereunder for all such Damages in excess of the Mini-Basket.

(c) _Third-Party Claims_. The obligations and liabilities of any party hereto
against which indemnification is sought hereunder with respect to claims
resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties shall be subject to
this Section 8.2(c).

(i) Promptly after receipt by any Indemnified Person of notice of any demand
or claim or the commencement of any action, proceeding or investigation (an "
_Asserted Liability_ ") that could reasonably be expected to result in
Damages, the Indemnified Person shall give notice thereof (a " _Claim Notice_
") to any other party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) (each such party, an " _Indemnifying
Person_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to a Buyer Indemnified
Persons right to indemnity under Section 8.2(a), the Stockholder
Representative shall act for the holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Options. Each Claim Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable
detail and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the
Damages that have been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Person. The
rights of any Indemnified Person to be indemnified hereunder shall not be
adversely affected by its failure to give, or its failure to timely give, a
Claim Notice with respect thereto unless, and if so, only to the extent that,
the Indemnifying Person is prejudiced thereby.

(ii) The Indemnifying Person shall have the right, exercisable by written
notice to the Indemnified Person within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Claim
Notice from the Indemnified Person, to assume the defense of such Asserted
Liability, using counsel selected by the Indemnifying Person and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Person (it being understood that the costs and
expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative will be reimbursed in
accordance with Section 8.3). Prior to the time which the Indemnifying
Party may assume the defense of any Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party
may take such actions as are reasonably necessary to preserve the ability to
defend such Asserted Liability and to preserve any  



 

56  counterclaims. In the event the Indemnifying Person elects to assume the
defense of the Asserted Liability, the Indemnifying Person shall only be
liable to the Indemnified Person for legal expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof prior to such
assumption of the defense by the Indemnifying Person. Subject to the
foregoing, if the Indemnifying Person elects to compromise or defend such
Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Person shall cooperate, at the expense of
the Indemnifying Person, in the compromise of, or defense against, such
Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Person elects not to defend
the Asserted Liability or fails to notify the Indemnified Person of its
election to defend within thirty (30) days as herein provided, the Indemnified
Person may defend such Asserted Liability until a notice of election to defend
is delivered. The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person may
participate, at their own expense, in the defense of such Asserted Liability.
If the Indemnifying Person elects to defend any claim, the Indemnified Person
shall make available to the Indemnifying Person any documents within its
control reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and the reasonable
assistance of its employees, for which the Indemnifying Person shall be
obliged to reimburse the Indemnified Person the reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of making them available. If the Indemnifying Person elects not to
defend any claim, the Indemnified Person shall provide to the Indemnifying
Person such information concerning the Asserted Liability, and the defense
thereof, as the Indemnifying Person shall reasonably request.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to assume control of such defense and
the Indemnifying Person shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Person and reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Person, if (A) the claim for indemnification relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation (provided, that in such event (x) the Indemnifying
Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to
employ counsel of its choice for such purpose ( _provided_ , that the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Person)
and (y) the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to review the files and
records relating to such defense upon request); (B) the Asserted Liability
seeks and continues to seek an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Person; (C) the Indemnifying Person failed or is failing
to diligently defend such claim; (D) the settlement of, or an adverse
judgment with respect to, the Asserted Liability is, in the good faith
judgment of the Indemnified Person, reasonably likely to establish judicial
precedent materially adverse to the continuing business interests of the
Indemnified Person; or (E) the claim would reasonably give rise to Damages
which are more than the amount indemnifiable by such Indemnifying Person
hereunder.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.2(c), to the
extent any third-party claims relate to Taxes, the following additional
provisions shall apply. Any Proceeding with respect to Taxes for a period
which commences prior to and includes but does not end on the Closing Date
shall be controlled jointly by the Stockholder Representative, acting on
behalf of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options, and
Parent. The Stockholder Representative shall not have the right to control any
Proceeding, to initiate any claim for refund, to file any amended return or to
take any other action (including settling any Proceeding) if, as a result of
such Proceeding, claim for refund, amended return or other action, the Taxes
payable by Parent or the Company for a taxable period for which the holders of
 



 

57  Company Common Stock or Company Options are not obligated to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(iii) would be likely
to be materially increased. By written notice to the Stockholder
Representative, Parent shall have the right to instruct the holders of Company
Common Stock or Company Options to forego a Proceeding with respect to one or
more Tax items for which the holders of Company Common Stock or Company
Options may be liable to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons. Such notice
shall constitute a waiver of the right of Buyer Indemnified Persons to
indemnification only for any Taxes arising out of such item for the period or
periods involved, but shall not otherwise waive any rights of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons under this Article VIII.

(v) If any Indemnifying Person has assumed the defense of an Asserted
Liability in accordance with the terms hereof, such Indemnifying Person shall
have the right to consent to the entry of judgment with respect to or
otherwise settle such Asserted Liability without the consent of the
Indemnified Party if (A) the settlement involves solely monetary damages, (B)
the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing to the Indemnified Party
that, as between the two, the Indemnifying Party is solely obligated to
satisfy and discharge the Asserted Liability and (C) such judgment or
settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Person of
the Asserted Liability, without prejudice to the Indemnified Person. If the
foregoing conditions are not satisfied, the Indemnifying Person shall have the
right to consent to the entry of judgment with respect to or otherwise settle
such Asserted Liability only upon receipt of the written consent of the
Indemnified Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the
Indemnified Person does not give such consent, the Indemnifying Party shall
resume the diligent defense of the Asserted Liability. Regardless of whether
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Asserted Liability
in accordance with the terms hereof, the Indemnified Person shall not admit
any liability with respect to, consent to the entry of judgment with respect
to, or otherwise settle such Asserted Liability without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in
the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation with the intent to deceive,
the limitations on indemnification (including as to duration and amount)
contained herein shall not apply to any claim for indemnification by an
Indemnified Person.

8.3. _Escrow Arrangements_.

(a) _Escrow Fund_. As security for the indemnity provided for in Section 8.2,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Escrow Agent the
Holdback Consideration. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Holdback
Consideration will be deposited with the Exchange Agent, or another
institution acceptable to Parent and the Shareholder Representative to act as
escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), which institution shall execute an
escrow agreement containing provisions substantially similar to this Section
8.3 and otherwise in form and substance as set forth in _Exhibit C_ attached
hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), such deposit to constitute an escrow
fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") to be governed by the terms set forth in the
Escrow Agreement.



 

58 (b) _Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Period_. Subject
to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence
immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate on the date that
is three (3) years following the Closing Date (such period being the " _Escrow
Period_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the remaining amount constituting
the balance of the Special Holdback Amount, after the application of such
funds as provided for herein, shall be released by the Escrow Agent and paid
to the Exchange Agent, to be distributed pro rata to each holder of Company
Common Stock or Company Options held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time, upon the later of (x) the date Final Debt and Final Working
Capital are determined or (y) the date of the final payment of all amounts
due to any party in respect of the redemption of the Senior Subordinated Notes
in accordance with Section 5.9; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Special
Holdback Amount is less than the amount of claims paid to or then asserted by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(iv), the remainder of the Escrow Fund shall
be used to cover such shortfall. In addition, on April 30, 2008 (the " _First
Release Date_ "), Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000),
less any amounts paid to Parent and the amount of any Unsatisfied Claims
asserted by Parent in accordance with this Article VIII since the Closing Date
for matters subject to indemnification in favor of a Buyer Indemnified Person
under this Article VIII, shall be delivered to the Exchange Agent to be
distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options.
Thereafter, upon the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Second Release Date_ "), Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($7,500,000), less any amounts paid to Parent and the amount of any
Unsatisfied Claims asserted by Parent in accordance with this Article VIII
since the First Release Date, shall be delivered to the Exchange Agent to be
distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options, and
upon the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date, Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000), less any amounts paid to Parent and the amount of any
Unsatisfied Claims asserted by Parent in accordance with this Article VIII
since the Second Release Date shall be delivered to the Exchange Agent to be
distributed to the holders of the Company Common Stock and Common Options.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Escrow Period shall not
terminate with respect to any amount of an unsatisfied claim specified in a
certificate signed by an officer of Parent prior to the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period (A) stating that a Buyer Indemnified Person has
incurred, paid or may incur or be required to make a payment for Damages, (B)
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Damages included in
the amount so stated (to the extent known or determinable) and the nature of
the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related and (C) that Parent has a good faith belief that it is entitled to
indemnification under Article VIII hereof, which is delivered to the Escrow
Agent prior to termination of the Escrow Period (any such certificate
including the requirements of clauses (A), (B) and (C) above, being a "
_Claims Notice_ " and the amount of any such claim specified in a Claims
Notice being an " _Unsatisfied Claim_ "). Any amount of the Escrow Fund not
subject to Unsatisfied Claims as contemplated by this Section 8.3 (the "
_Remaining Holdback Consideration_ ") shall be delivered to the Exchange
Agent to be distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Options upon the termination of the Escrow Period. As soon as any such claims
have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent to
be distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options the
remaining portion, if any, of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy any
Unsatisfied Claims then pending as additional Holdback Consideration.
Deliveries of Holdback Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock
and Company Options pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall  



 

59  be made in proportion to their respective holdings of Company Common Stock
(calculated on a fully diluted basis) at the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to any such distribution to the holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Options, the Stockholder Representative shall be
entitled to receive from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to any and all fees
and expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative after the Closing in
connection with the performance of its duties hereunder (such fees and
expenses to be evidenced by written invoices delivered to the Escrow Agent by
the Stockholder Representative) that have not been previously reimbursed, and
such amount shall be deducted from the amount to be distributed to such
holders.

(c) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except as contemplated by Section
8.2(c)(vi), Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that their sole and
exclusive remedy for Damages with respect to any and all claims relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement shall be satisfied by distribution from
the Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.3 and the
Escrow Agreement.

8.4.  _Other Limitations_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that except with respect to
equitable remedies or in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation
with intent to deceive, their sole and exclusive remedy for damages with
respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
VIII.

(b) The amount of any Damages for which relief is provided under any of
Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(b) shall be net of (i) any specific reserves (to the
extent taken into account as a liability in the calculation of Final Working
Capital) established on the Closing Statement with respect to the matters to
which such Damages relate and (ii) any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Person from any unrelated third parties or under insurance
policies with respect to such Damages (less any out-of-pocket expenses or
costs incurred to obtain such recoveries and less any increase in premiums
attributable to the incurrence of such Damages). If requested in writing by an
Indemnifying Person, an Indemnified Person shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to seek recovery under insurance policies for any claim for
which the Indemnifying Person has made payment in full within a reasonable
amount of time after such payment by an Indemnifying Person or alternatively,
may, assuming such payment in full by an Indemnifying Person and to the extent
permitted under applicable law and the relevant insurance policy, grant an
assignment of the right of such Indemnified Person to assert a claim under
such insurance policies. In the event of such assignment, the Indemnifying
Person will pursue the claim at its own expense. For the avoidance of doubt,
the parties agree that the rights of an Indemnified Person to seek and collect
indemnification in full from any Indemnifying Person shall not be qualified,
tolled, delayed or impaired in any manner by reason of any claims that may
exist in favor of the Indemnified Person against third parties or under
insurance coverage. An Indemnified Person shall be under no obligation to (x)
pursue any claims which it may have against third parties or (y) grant or
assign any right or claim which it may have against any third party to any
Indemnifying Person except as provided in Section 8.5(d). To the extent an
Indemnified Person receives payments that constitute final and unconditional
double recovery in respect of the same claim or series of claims from an
Indemnifying Person and from a third party  



 

60  after first receiving payment in full by an Indemnifying Person, the
Indemnified Person shall refund to the Indemnifying Person an amount up to the
amount constituting the double recovery, net of all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with or arising out
such claim.

8.5. _Environmental Matters_.

(a) _Environmental Investigation_. In the event any Buyer Indemnified Person
(or its agents, contractors, employees or others acting on its behalf)
conducts Environmental Sampling (as defined below) in violation of this
Section 8.5(a), they shall not be entitled to seek indemnification with
respect to any environmental condition discovered as a result thereof. At any
time following the Closing Date, any Buyer Indemnified Person may, after
providing ten (10) days prior written notice to the Stockholder
Representative (or any shorter period in circumstances where the Buyer
Indemnified Person determines in good faith it must conduct such Environmental
Sampling expeditiously), conduct, at its sole cost and expense, invasive
environmental sampling or testing of soil, sediment, groundwater, surface
water or ambient air (" _Environmental Sampling_ ") under the following
conditions:

(i) For the known contamination or recognized environmental conditions (as
defined in the American Society of Testing and Materials Standard E-1527-05
(hereinafter a " _Recognized Environmental Condition_ " or " _REC_ "))
described on Exhibit E at the Real Property listed on Exhibit E,
Environmental Sampling may be conducted if and only to the extent reasonably
necessary to investigate such known contamination or Recognized Environmental
Condition listed on Exhibit E (or any known or unknown contamination or
Recognized Environmental Condition identified in the course of Environmental
Sampling permitted under this Section 8.5(a)(i)) if it presents or is
reasonably likely to present a substantial endangerment to health or the
environment, or otherwise result in the payment of Damages by any Buyer
Indemnified Party arising from the existence, or a Release, of Materials of
Environmental Concern.

(ii) For all Real Property (including the Real Property subject to Section
8.5(a)(i) above), in addition to the Environmental Sampling allowed
under Section 8.5(a)(i) above, Environmental Sampling may also be conducted
if: (1) required by Environmental Law; (2) required by an enforceable order,
directive or demand of a Governmental Authority acting within its
jurisdiction; (3) reasonably necessary to investigate conditions that pose a
substantial and immediate or imminent endangerment to health or the
environment; (4) reasonably necessary to defend against or otherwise respond
to a claim by any third parties; (5) with respect to Leased Real Property,
reasonably necessary to comply in all material respects with the requirements
of the applicable lease agreement (as the environmental or other related
provisions of such lease agreement are in effect as of the date hereof); or
(6) required in connection with the bona fide repair of Improvements at any of
the Real Property actually undertaken to the extent such Environmental
Sampling is required to accomplish such repair, provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the indemnification of any Buyer Indemnified Persons shall
not be limited with respect to Damages for environmental matters where the
environmental conditions giving rise to such Damages were discovered as a
result of any Buyer Indemnified Person conducting Environmental Sampling or
analysis that is required by applicable Environmental Laws of any production
water wells that exist and are in use on the  



 

61  Closing Date at any Real Property, any wastewater discharges at any Real
Property or any indoor or outdoor air at any Real Property.

(b) _Remediation Standard_. "Remediation Standard" shall mean, with respect to
environmental matters for which indemnity is provided herein and for which
Remedial Action is required in connection with the resolution of such matter,
the least stringent cleanup standard that: (i) is required under applicable
Environmental Laws; (ii) complies in all material respects with any order or
requirement of any applicable Governmental Authority consistent with the
current property use and zoning for the property; (iii) where applicable,
settles and resolves any related Asserted Liability for which the
Seller Indemnifying Person is responsible under this Agreement, the
resolution of which requires Remedial Action; (iv) reduces employee exposure
to any Materials of Environmental Concern below applicable permissible
exposure limits established by applicable Governmental Authorities; (v) with
respect to Leased Real Property, satisfies the requirements in all material
respects under the applicable lease agreement (as the environmental or other
related provisions of such lease agreement are in effect as of the date
hereof); (vi) does not unreasonably and materially interfere with continued
commercial and business use, as the case may be, of the facility and its
corresponding property (as such facility or property was in use on the
Closing Date); and (vii) does not unreasonably expose Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to a risk of material liability to
third parties as a result of the offsite migration of Materials of
Environmental Concern. With respect to environmental matters for which
indemnity is provided herein and for which Remedial Action is required in the
resolution of such matters, the Remedial Action undertaken shall be to the
extent necessary to achieve the Remediation Standard and each Remedial Action
shall be performed using the then prevailing industry practice method of
achieving such Remediation Standard. With respect to environmental matters for
which indemnity is provided herein as a result of an inaccuracy in, or breach
of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in Section 3.1(r)
of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Company in connection
with Section 3.1(r) of this Agreement, in either case relating to a violation
of any Environmental Law, Damages shall not include the capital cost of a new
item of additional equipment or facility that is required by the applicable
Governmental Authority after the Closing Date to prevent reoccurrence of the
violation, even if such requirement resulted from violations prior to the

upon written request from the Stockholder Representative to the applicable
Buyer Indemnified Person, such Buyer Indemnified Person agrees to assign to
the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the holders of Company Common
Stock and Company Options, any and all rights to indemnity, recovery,
contribution or any other action against any other Person pursuant to any
agreement set forth on _Exhibit F_ attached hereto. Concurrently with any such
assignment to the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the holders of

and Company Options, shall hold harmless and indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Persons, from and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred which arise

claim is asserted as contemplated by this Section 8.5, for which a Buyer
Indemnified Person has provided a Claim Notice pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(i)
of this Agreement to the Stockholder Representative, then such Buyer
Indemnified Person shall reasonably cooperate with the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Options, by providing copies of documents and access to employees in respect
of such claim for indemnity, recovery, contribution or any other action
against any other Person, and the applicable Buyer Indemnified Person agrees
not to take or fail to take any action, to the extent permitted under the
agreement to be assigned or under any law, rule, regulation, decree, written
or other judicial or administrative order or directive then applicable to it,
that waives or extinguishes such Buyer Indemnified Persons right to
indemnity, recovery, contribution or any other action against any other Person
or other remedy available under the agreements set forth in Exhibit F prior to
such assignment; provided that in no event shall a Buyer Indemnified Person
be required to spend more than 100 man hours in the aggregate per calendar
year toward such cooperation. For purposes of this section, a "Fully Reserved
Claim Notice" is a written notice delivered by the Stockholder
Representative to a Buyer Indemnified Person, with a copy to the Escrow Agent

Claims Notice with respect to a breach of the representations and warranties
in Section 3.1(r) and certifying that the remaining amount of the Escrow Fund
is sufficient to satisfy such Damages. 

(e) _Forbearance_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
with respect to an REC or Release of Materials of Environmental Concern for
which a Buyer Indemnified Person is or could reasonably be expected to be
responsible and for which a Buyer Indemnified Person is indemnified pursuant
to this Agreement, as long as a creditworthy third party or the applicable
Indemnifying Person is timely performing remediation of such REC or Release in
compliance with a remediation plan approved by the applicable Governmental
Authority (with respect to each factor, as determined by Parent in its
reasonable discretion, including with respect to the quality or scope of such
remediation), Parent and Merger Sub shall not undertake the remediation of
such REC or Release for so long as such timely remediation continues to be so
performed.
