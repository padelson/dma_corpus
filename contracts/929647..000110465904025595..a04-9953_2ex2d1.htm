 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  



  

 **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**  (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
August 24, 2004, is by and among Price Legacy Corporation, a Maryland
corporation (the " _Company_ "), PL Retail LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Parent_ "), and PL Acquisition Corp., a Maryland corporation ("
_Merger Sub_ ").

  



  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") on the terms and conditions
contained in this Agreement; and

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved
this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to action taken by unanimous written consent in accordance
with the requirements of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_
") and the charter and bylaws of Merger Sub.

  



  

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

  



  

# ARTICLE I.

  

# 

  

# THE MERGER

  

# 

  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined),
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. Following the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_
"). The corporate existence of the Company, with all its purposes, rights,
privileges, franchises, powers and objects, shall continue unaffected and
unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving Corporation, it shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Maryland.

  



  

Section 1.2 _The Deposit_. On the date hereof, Parent shall pay Twenty Five
Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (the " _Deposit_ "), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to the Company. The Deposit will be (a) used by
the Company to effect the Redemption (as hereinafter defined) in accordance
with Section 1.3, or (b) released to Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, in the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article
VIII before the Company commences the Redemption by notice to stockholders
or otherwise.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Redemption_. The Company shall, pursuant to the Articles of
Amendment and Restatement of the Company (the " _Amended and
Restated Charter_ "), exercise its right to redeem so much of the Series A
Preferred Stock as permitted by the Deposit and consummate such redemption as
soon as practicable thereafter and in any event prior to the Closing Date,
but only to the extent determined in good faith by the Company to be
consistent with the Companys tax status as a REIT and allowable with
reference to Section 2-311 of the MGCL (collectively, the " _Redemption_ ").

  



  

1      
   



  

Section 1.4 _Effective Time_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause
the Merger to be consummated in accordance with all appropriate laws by
filing such articles of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such
case, the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the State Department of Assessments
and Taxation of Maryland. The Merger shall become effective at the time
specified in the Articles of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective
being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.5 _Closing of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place at a time and on a date to be specified by the
parties (the " _Closing Date_ ") as soon as practicable after satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, but in no event earlier
than September 15, 2004, or later than the Drop-Dead Date (as hereinafter
defined), at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 12636 High Bluff Drive,
Suite 300, San Diego, California 92130.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the MGCL.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations
of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, duties and
obligations of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.7 _Surviving Corporation Charter and Bylaws_. The Amended and
Restated Charter in effect at the Effective Time shall be the charter of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Charter_ "), until
thereafter amended. The bylaws of the Company in effect at the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended.

  



  

Section 1.8 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_.

  



  

### (a) The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall become the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office in accordance with the
Surviving Corporation Charter and Surviving Corporation Bylaws until their
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

  

### 

  

### (b) The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall become the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time,
to hold office in accordance with the Surviving Corporation Charter and
Surviving Corporation Bylaws until their successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

  

### 

  

### (c) Resignations will be tendered for all current directors and officers
of the Company effective upon the Effective Time.

# ARTICLE II.

  

# 

  

# MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF STOCK

  

# 

  

Section 2.1 _Conversion or Retention of Company Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder thereof:

  



  

### (a) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.0004 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall have issued and outstanding that number of
shares of Merger Sub Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than and excluding any Excluded Shares (as hereinafter defined).

  

### 

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Merger Sub-Owned Company Common
Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock that
is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Parent or Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded
Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no cash, Company Common Stock or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other
than Excluded Shares shall be converted into the right to receive following
the Merger an amount in cash equal to Eighteen Dollars and Eight Five Cents
($18.85) (the " _Merger Consideration_ "); provided that, if the Closing
occurs after October 1, 2004, the Merger Consideration shall be increased by
an amount equal to Twenty-Eight Cents ($0.28) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days from and including October 1, 2004
until the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is ninety (90).

  

### 

  

### (d) _Cancellation and Retirement of Company Common Stock_. As of the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall, to the extent
such Certificate represents such shares, cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except, in all cases, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock
to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the
amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax law.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Retention of Company Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series 1 Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
and shall continue to represent a share of Series A Preferred Stock or Series
1 Preferred Stock, as the case may be, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

3      
   



  

### (f) _Cancellation of Company Stock Options_. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to assure that, immediately prior to or at the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option, whether or not then exercisable
or vested, shall be canceled, and shall no longer be outstanding and in
consideration of such cancellation, each holder of a Company Stock Option
shall have the right to receive an amount in respect thereof equal to the
product of (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
of such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject thereto (such payment to be net of any withholding
taxes applicable thereto) (the " _Option Merger Consideration_ ").

  

### 

  

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

### (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory
to Merger Sub to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration.
At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving
Corporation to deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this Article II, and for the benefit of holders of Company Stock Options for
payment in accordance with Section 2.1(f), the aggregate Merger Consideration
and Option Merger Consideration (such cash consideration being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), less any portion of the Deposit not
used by the Company to effect the Redemption, and all interest and other
amounts earned with respect thereto, which shall be deposited by the Company
with the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall make payments of the
Merger Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration out of the Exchange
Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Articles of Merger. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all
interest earned on the Exchange Fund shall be paid to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the common
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of the Company Common Stock on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates representing ownership of the Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
rights with respect to such Company Common Stock, except as otherwise
provided for herein. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted
into the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. On and after
the Effective Time, a holder of a Company Stock Option shall have only the
right to receive the Option Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.1(f).

  

### 

  

### (c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as possible after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1:  (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates

  



  

4      
   



  

shall pass to the Exchange Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to
the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the amount of cash payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender, the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Company Stock
Options Exchanged For Cash_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock exchanged for cash theretofore represented by such Certificates.
The Option Merger Consideration paid with respect to Company Stock Options in
accordance with the terms of this Article II and Section 2.1(f) shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
canceled Company Stock Options and on and after the Effective Time the holder
of a Company Stock Option shall have no further rights to exercise any
Company Stock Option.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock prior to the
Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as general
creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Exchange Agent, or any employee,
officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person
in respect of Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to three (3)
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which the Merger Consideration

  



  

5      
   



  

would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation,
on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all
times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof,
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

### 

  

Section 2.3 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_. In the event that,
subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding shall, through a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend,
stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in the
capitalization of the Company, increase or decrease in number or be changed
into or exchanged for a different kind or number of securities, then an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration.

which would adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company
Employee Benefit Plan or the exemption of such trust.

Schedule, none of the Employee Benefit Plans provide for continuing post-

### (a) All federal and all other material Tax Returns (as hereinafter
defined) required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries have been filed with the appropriate taxing authorities in all
jurisdictions in which such Tax Returns are required to be filed

qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated, and will continue to
operate through the Closing Date, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT
(without regard to the REIT distribution requirements); provided that the

depend, in part, upon its method of operation post-Closing; as a result, in

and through the end of the Companys taxable year in which the
Closing occurs, the Company will continue to be organized and operate in

as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not
since the later of its formation or the acquisition by the Company of a
direct or indirect interest therein, owned any assets (including, without
limitation, securities) that would cause the Company to violate Section

in Section 3.16(a)(iv); provided, however, any contract under clause (viii)
above that, by its terms, is terminable within thirty (30) days (without
termination fee or penalty) of the date of this Agreement shall not be deemed

3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and (x) contracts and agreements to
enter into any of the foregoing (such contracts and agreements, the "
_Company Material Contracts_ "). Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists, as of June 30, 2004, the outstanding principal balance,
maturity date and applicable interest rate (including the method or formula
for calculating any interest that is not a fixed percentage of the principal
balance) for the indebtedness evidenced by each loan listed on the Company
Disclosure Schedule pursuant to Section 3.16(a)(iv) hereof.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each of the Company Material Contracts is in full force and effect
and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company or
its subsidiaries, enforceable against the Company or its subsidiaries, as the
case may be, in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles).
To the Companys knowledge, there is no default (nor does there exist any
condition which upon the passage of time or the

  



  

26      
   



  

giving of notice or both would cause such a violation or default) under any
Company Material Contract so listed by the Company as would have or
would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

### 

  

### (c) To the extent not set forth in response to the requirements of
Section 3.16(a) hereof, Section 3.16(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth each interest rate cap, interest rate collar, interest rate swap,
currency hedging transaction, and any other agreement relating to a similar
transaction to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or an
obligor with respect thereto.

  

### 

  

### (d) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has (i) any
continuing material contractual liability for indemnification or
otherwise under any agreement relating to the sale of real estate previously
owned, whether directly or indirectly, by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, except for standard indemnification provisions entered into in
the normal course of business, (ii) any continuing liability to make any
reprorations or adjustments to prorations that may previously have been made
with respect to any property currently or formerly owned by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, or (iii) any continuing contractual liability to pay
any additional purchase price for any of the Company Properties.

date, the Merger Consideration is fair to the Companys stockholders (other
than Parent, Merger Sub and any Affiliates of Parent) from a financial point
of view.

  



  

Section 3.18 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
the Company Financial Advisor, a correct and complete copy of
whose engagement agreement has been made available to Parent) is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission or expense reimbursement
in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made by and on behalf
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 3.19 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company has taken all action required
to be taken by it in order to exempt this Agreement and the Merger from, and
this Agreement and the Merger are exempt from, the requirements of any
"moratorium", "control share", "fair price", "affiliate transaction",
"business combination" or other takeover Laws and regulations of any state
(collectively, " _Takeover Statutes_ "), including the Maryland Business
Combination Act and Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act or any takeover
provision in the Amended and Restated Charter or the Companys bylaws.

  



  

Section 3.20 _Related Party Transactions_. Except as set forth in Section

of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a list of all agreements and contracts
entered into by the Company or any of the Companys subsidiaries under which
continuing obligations exist with any Person who is an officer, director or
Affiliate (as defined

  



  

27      
   



  

below) of the Company or any of the Companys subsidiaries, any member of the
"immediate family" (as such term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act) of any of the foregoing or any
entity of which any of the foregoing is an Affiliate (each, a " _Related
Party_ "). Unless otherwise agreed to by Parent in writing, all debt owed by
any Related Party to the Company will be paid in full at or prior to the
Effective Time. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_ " shall
have the same meaning as such term is declined in Rule 405 promulgated under
the Securities Act.

Section 3.22 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor its
subsidiaries is a party to any licenses, contracts or agreements with respect
to use by the Company or its subsidiaries of any trademarks or patents. The
Companys intellectual property constitutes all of the intellectual property
necessary to carry on the business of the Company and its subsidiaries as
currently conducted, except where the failure to have such property would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company intellectual property is valid and has not been cancelled, forfeited,
expired or abandoned, and neither the Company nor any subsidiary has received
any written notice challenging the validity or enforceability of Company
intellectual property, other than as would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Companys knowledge, the
conduct of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries does not
violate, misappropriate or infringe upon the intellectual property rights of
any third Person, other than as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the material loss or
material impairment of the right of the Company or any Company subsidiary to
own or use any of the Companys intellectual property, and the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries will have substantially the same rights to
own or use the Company intellectual property following the consummation of
such transactions as the Company and its subsidiaries had prior to the
consummation of such transactions, except such rights as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

obligations under such policies in any material respect.  Except as set
forth in Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company
nor any subsidiary has received any written notice of cancellation or
termination with respect to any existing insurance policy set forth in
Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that is held by, or for the
benefit of, any of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or that relates to
any Company Property.

Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b).

Section 6.1 _Proxy Statement_.

  



  

### (a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof
or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and, after approval by
Merger Sub (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), file the
preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) obtain and furnish the information required to be
included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement and, after approval by Merger Sub
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), respond promptly to
any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement; and (ii)
promptly upon the earlier of (x) receiving notification that the SEC is not
reviewing the preliminary Proxy Statement and (y) the conclusion of any SEC
review of the preliminary Proxy Statement, cause a definitive Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the Companys stockholders and, if necessary, after the
definitive Proxy Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate
amended or supplemental proxy materials and, if required in connection
therewith, resolicit proxies; provided, however, that no such amended or
supplemental proxy materials will be mailed by the Company without
consultation and review by Parent or Merger Sub. The Company will promptly
notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of comments of the SEC and of any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the preliminary Proxy
Statement or definitive Proxy Statement or for additional information, and
will promptly supply Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all written
correspondence between the Company or its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, the definitive Proxy Statement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub will cooperate with the Company in connection with the

  



  

36      
   



  

preparation of the Proxy Statement, including, but not limited to, furnishing
to the Company any and all information regarding Parent and Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates as may be required to be disclosed therein. The
Proxy Statement shall contain the recommendation of the Board of Directors
that the Companys stockholders approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided that the Board of Directors may withdraw,
modify or change its recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement if it
does so in accordance with Section 6.4 hereof.

  

### 

  

### (b) None of the information supplied by each of the Company and Parent
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement (including by incorporation
by reference) shall, (i) when filed with the SEC or other regulatory agency,
(ii) when it (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is mailed to
the stockholders of the Company, (iii) at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, and (iv) at the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to
the Company or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, or their
respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, which, pursuant to the Securities Act or
Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly
inform the other party hereto. All documents that the Company is responsible
for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply as to form
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act.

  

### 

  

Section 6.2 _Company Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company shall call and
hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_")
as promptly as practicable after September 15, 2004 for the purpose of voting
upon, among other things, the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to the
provisions of Section 6.4, and subject at all times to the Companys and its
directors right and duty to act in a manner consistent with their fiduciary
duties as they are advised by outside legal counsel, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and shall take all other action reasonably
necessary or advisable to secure the vote of its stockholders required by any
rule or regulation of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (" _Nasdaq_ ") or
Maryland Law, as applicable, to obtain such approvals.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no stockholder of the Company,
whether such stockholder is a director, officer or otherwise, shall have any
legal obligation under this Agreement to vote its Company Stock in favor of
the Merger.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

### (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, but subject to
the obligation to act in good faith, and subject at all times to
the Companys and its directors right and duty to act in a manner consistent
with their fiduciary duties as they are advised by outside legal counsel,
each party hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws and regulations
to consummate the Merger and to cause to be

  



  

37      
   



  

satisfied all conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement,
in each case as soon as practicable, after the date hereof, including,
consistent with the foregoing, (i) preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable with the objective of being in a position to consummate
the Merger as promptly as practicable following the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to obtain
as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Required
Approvals_ "), and (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Required Approvals.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission to or any investigation or proceeding by the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Entity. Neither Parent
nor the Company shall make any such filing or submission to or respond to any
such investigation or proceeding by the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity, or otherwise approach any such Governmental Entity with
respect to this Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits hereto) or
the transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of
the other party, except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any rule or regulation of Nasdaq or other similar
exchange.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 6.3(a) to obtain all Required Approvals, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) subject to applicable Law, permit the
other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other in connection with, any proposed written or material
oral communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) between it and
any Governmental Entity, and (ii) promptly inform each other of and supply to
such other party any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda)
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the DOJ, the FTC or
any other Governmental Entity, in each case regarding the Merger contemplated
hereby. Parent and the Company shall be permitted to pay all assignment,
assumption and similar fees and expenses necessary to obtain the Required
Approvals.

  

### 

  

### (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 6.3, if any objections are asserted with respect to
the Merger contemplated hereby under any antitrust or competition Law, each
of Parent and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts (which
under no circumstances shall involve divesting of material assets) to resolve
any antitrust concerns, federal, state, foreign or private, obtain
all Required Approvals and obtain termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act or any other applicable Law and the termination of any outstanding
judicial or administrative orders prohibiting the Closing so as to permit
consummation of the Merger as soon as practicable.  In furtherance and not
in limitation thereof, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened in writing to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law or regulation, or if
any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or

  



  

38      
   



  

administrative order is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by
a Governmental Entity that would make the Merger illegal or would
otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation the Merger,
the parties shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in responding thereto,
and each shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest, resist
and/or attempt to resolve any such action or proceeding and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger contemplated
by this Agreement, and to have such statute, rule, regulation, executive
order, decree, injunction or administrative order repealed, rescinded or made
inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the Merger.

  

### 

  

Section 6.4 _Company Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

### (a) From the date hereof until the termination hereof and except as
permitted by the following provisions of this Section 6.4, but subject at all
times to the Companys and its directors right and duty to act in a manner
consistent with their fiduciary duties as they are advised by outside legal
counsel (provided that any such actions shall not restrict Parents right to
receive the Termination Fee upon termination of this Agreement under Section
8.3(b)(iii)), the Company will not, nor will it permit any of
its subsidiaries to, nor will it permit any officer, director, employee or
agent of, or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor
or representative of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries to (and the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause its controlling
stockholders not to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage (including by furnishing nonpublic information) any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter
defined), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations in furtherance
of such inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal, or the making of any
proposal that constitutes any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) agree to,
approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that
subject to the Companys compliance with this Section 6.4, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (A)
entering into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a
Superior Proposal (as defined below) if the Company or the Company Board has
complied with the procedures of this Section 6.4 and is simultaneously
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), or (B) furnishing
information to (subject to a confidentiality agreement at least as
restrictive as the Confidentiality Agreement in all material respects), or
entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any
Person that makes an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to
the Company if (1) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would create a
reasonable probability of a breach of its duties to stockholders imposed by
Law, (2) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal would be
reasonably likely, if consummated, to constitute a Superior Proposal (as
hereinafter defined) and (3) prior to taking such action, the Company
complies in all material respects with the procedures set forth in this
Section 6.4.  The Company shall (i) promptly, and in any event within two
(2) business days, notify Parent orally and in writing after receipt by the
Company (or its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal, including the material
terms and conditions thereof, to the extent known, and the identity of the
Person making it, (ii) promptly, and in any event within two (2) business

  



  

39      
   



  

days, notify Parent orally and in writing after receipt of any request for
non-public information relating to it or any of its subsidiaries or
for access to its or any of its subsidiaries properties, books or records by
any Person that, to the Companys knowledge, is reasonably likely to make, or
has made, an Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) notify Parent within one
(1) business day of any material change to the terms and conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not release any third party
from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it is a party. Immediately after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company will, and will instruct its subsidiaries, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (b) Subject at all times to the Companys and its directors right and
duty to act in a manner consistent with their fiduciary duties as they are
advised by outside legal counsel, the Company Board will not withdraw or
modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent,
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, and will
not approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, unless in connection with
a Superior Proposal which is pending at the time the Company determines to
take such action (i) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that to do otherwise would
create a reasonable probability of a breach of its duties to stockholders
imposed by Law, (ii) the Company provides Parent with notice of its decision
to withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or
the Merger, and (iii) during the three (3) business day period after
the Companys notice, the Company shall have offered to negotiate with, and,
if accepted, negotiated in good faith with, Parent toward a proposal that
would be superior to the Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement,
a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
which (i) in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, is reasonably
likely to be consummated, and (ii) a majority of the Company Board determines
in their good faith judgment after consultation with outside financial
advisors to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view (which determination may take into account legal and regulatory
matters) than the Merger. For purposes of the definition of
Superior Proposal, an " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 9.11, except that each reference to "20
percent" in such definition shall be deemed to be a reference to "50
percent."

  

### 

  

### (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders which, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, the failure to make would be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable Law; provided, however, that except as otherwise permitted
in Section 6.4(b), the Company does not withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, its position with respect to the Merger or approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal.

  

### 

  

Section 6.5 _Resignations_. Upon the written request of Parent, (i)
the Company shall cause any or all of the directors (or persons occupying
similar positions in any limited liability

  



  

40      
   



  

company or other entity) and/or officers of each direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary to resign or be removed or, as to officers, to resign or be
terminated, effective as of the Closing, and (ii) if the Company or any of
its affiliated entities has the right to appoint any director (or
person occupying a similar position in any limited liability company or other
entity) or to cause the resignation or termination of any officer of any
other entity in which the Company (directly or indirectly) owns an equity
interest, the Company shall cause, effective as of the Closing, such director
to resign or to be removed and/or such officer to resign or be terminated.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company will consult with
each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other written public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any rule or regulation of Nasdaq, or other similar exchange. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be in the form agreed to by
the parties hereto prior to the execution of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

  



  

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present or former officer, director,
employee or other representative of the Company or any Company subsidiary and
any person who becomes an officer, director, employee or other representative
of the Company or any Company subsidiary after the date hereof but prior to
the Effective Time (each an " _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), to the same extent as such officers, directors,
employees or other representatives are entitled to indemnification under the
Amended and Restated Charter, bylaws, employment agreements or
indemnification contracts as in effect on the date hereof in respect of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
without limitation the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Each
employment agreement and indemnification agreement referred to in the
preceding sentence either (i) has been provided to Parent prior to the date
hereof or (ii) contains indemnification provisions substantially in the form
contained in an employment agreement or an indemnification agreement, as the
case may be, provided to Parent prior to the date hereof.

  

### 

  

### (b) Any Indemnified Parties proposing to assert the right to
be indemnified under Section 6.7(a) shall, promptly after receipt of
notice of commencement of any action against such Indemnified Parties in
respect of which a claim is to be made under Section 6.7(a) against the
Surviving Corporation, notify the Surviving Corporation of the commencement
of such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served; provided, however,
that the failure to so notify the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve it
from any liability which it may have under Section 6.7(a) unless the
Surviving Corporation is materially prejudiced thereby.  If any such action
is brought against any of the Indemnified Parties and such Indemnified
Parties notify the Surviving Corporation of its commencement, the Surviving
Corporation will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that the
Surviving Corporation elects by delivering written notice to such Indemnified
Parties promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of the action

  



  

41      
   



  

from the Indemnified Parties, to assume the defense of the action
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties after notice
from the Surviving Corporation to the Indemnified Parties of its election to
assume the defense, the Surviving Corporation will not be liable to the
Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses except as provided below.
If the Surviving Corporation assumes the defense, the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to settle such action without the consent of the
Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall
be required to obtain such consent if the settlement includes any admission
of wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnified Parties or any decree or
restriction on the Indemnified Parties; provided, further, that the Surviving
Corporation, in the defense of any such action shall not, except with the
consent of the Indemnified Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant
or plaintiff to such Indemnified Parties of a release from all liability with
respect to such action. The Indemnified Parties will have the right to employ
their own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses or other charges
of such counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnified Parties unless (i)
the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Parties has been authorized in
writing by the Surviving Corporation, (ii) a conflict exists (based on advice
of counsel to the Indemnified Parties) between the Indemnified Parties and
the Surviving Corporation (in which case the Surviving Corporation will not
have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the
Indemnified Parties) or (iii) the Surviving Corporation has not in fact
employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable
time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of
which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of one
additional counsel (representing all of the Indemnified Parties) will be at
the expense of the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation in a timely manner as statements therefor are received
(regardless of whether received prior to or after final disposition of the
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation). The Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected
without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld).

  

### 

  

### (c) The Surviving Corporation shall obtain and maintain in effect at the
Effective Time and continuing until the sixth anniversary thereof "run-off"
director and officer liability coverage with a coverage amount of $15,000,000
and other terms and conditions in all material respects no less favorable to
the Indemnified Parties than under the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance policy covering the directors and officers
of the Company with respect to their service as such prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
be obligated to pay more than $1,200,000 in the aggregate for such coverage.

  

### 

  

### (d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume the obligations set for in this Section 6.7.

  



  

42      
   



  

### (e) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives.

  

### 

  

Section 6.8 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

### (a) _Benefit Plans_. After the Effective Time, all employees of the
Company (" _Company Employees_ ") who are employed by Parent or
its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, shall, at the option
of Parent, either continue to be eligible to participate in an "employee
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (an " _Employee Benefit
Plan_ "), of the Company which is, at the option of Parent, continued by
Parent, or alternatively shall be eligible to participate in the same manner
as other similarly situated employees of Parent or its subsidiaries in a
similar Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or in which
employees of Parent or its subsidiaries participate after the Effective Time.
With respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan of Parent, service with the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and the predecessor of any of them shall
be included for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting
(if applicable) and determination of the level of entitlement to benefits
under such Employee Benefit Plan. Parent shall, or shall cause
its subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations, as to preexisting
conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to all Company Employees under any welfare
plan that such Company Employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained by the Company for such
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each such
Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time for the plan year within which the Effective Time
occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in
after the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Company Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to fully vest as of the Effective
Time all Company Stock Options.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Severance_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt a
severance plan, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
covering each of the individuals listed in Section 6.8(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, which will provide that if any such
individuals employment is terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
without cause, or by such individual due to a reduction in salary, benefits,
job responsibilities or other terms of employment, or a change in job
location, within one year after the Closing, he/she will be entitled to the
severance and retention payments set forth opposite such individuals name
in Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

### 

  

Section 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, if (i)
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified
by materiality becomes untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is not so

  



  

43      
   



  

qualified becomes untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (ii) any
failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, materially to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Restrictions on Dividends_. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall not make any dividend or distribution to its
stockholders (other than (a) the redemption by the Company of
1,500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock as announced by the Company
on August 13, 2004 and (b) the Redemption) without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall be in Parents sole discretion);
provided, however, that the written consent of Parent shall not be required
for the authorization and payment of the greater of (x) distributions
required for the Company to maintain its status as a REIT under the Code or
to avoid the payment of income or excise tax under Sections 857 or 4981 of
the Code; or (y) dividends or distributions of up to $0.28 per share to
holders of the Company Common Stock on August 15, 2004, up to $1.40 per year
per share to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and up to $1.16 per year
per share to holders of the Series 1 Preferred Stock, in accordance with (A)
the terms of Sections (c)(1) and (d)(1) of Article Sixth of the Amended and
Restated Charter as in effect on the date hereof, and (B) except insofar as
necessary to fulfill the Board Redemption Actions or in connection with the
aforesaid redemption of 1,500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock as
announced by the Company on August 13, 2004, past practices.

  



  

Section 6.11 _Taxes_.

  



  

### (a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution
and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related
interests, penalties or additions to tax, " _Transfer and Gains Taxes_ ").
The Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or
withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to stockholders of the
Company, all Transfer and Gains Taxes.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company will consult with and provide Parent the opportunity to
review and comment upon all returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents to be filed after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time
by the Company with respect to Taxes including, without limitation, the

the prior review and comment of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
delayed.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Company will cause each of the Companys subsidiaries to consult
with and provide Parent the opportunity to review and comment upon
all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents to be filed
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time by each respective
subsidiary of the Company with respect to Taxes including, without
limitation, each of the Companys subsidiaries federal, state and local
income tax returns for its taxable years ended December 31, 2003, and the
Company shall cause each of its

  



  

44      
   



  

subsidiaries not to file any such returns without the prior review
and comment of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably delayed.

  

### 

  

Section 6.12 _Company REIT Status_.

  



  

### (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking, and the
Company hereby agrees to take, any action at any time or from time to time
that in the reasonable judgment of the Company Board, upon advice of counsel,
is legally necessary for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT
within the meaning of Sections 856-860 of the Code for any period or portion
thereof ending on or prior to the Effective Time, including
without limitation, making dividend or distribution payments to Company
stockholders in accordance with Section 6.10 or otherwise.

  

### 

  

### (b) From the Closing Date through the end of the Companys taxable year

used exclusively for the purposes described in Section 642(c) of the Code or
a corresponding provision of a prior income tax law (each, an " _Organization_

Paragraphs (b)(1)a and (b)(1)b of the Amended and Restated Charter as a

Constructive Ownership that would result in the Company owning (actually or
Constructively) an interest in a tenant that is described in Section

companies) from such tenant would cause the Company to fail to satisfy any of

that Parent violates any of the aforesaid representations or warranties, then

lenders to consummate the Merger (including consent to the change in property
management), as listed in Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Lender Consents"). Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, in connection with the Companys obtaining the Lender

### (b) (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) by either the
Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or (B) by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(k), then the Company shall pay Parent Ten Million
Dollars ($10,000,000) by wire transfer of same day funds to an account

### 

  

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
either Section 8.1(h) or Section 8.1(l), then the Company shall reimburse

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.1(d), (B) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e), (C) by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(h) (but only, in the case of this clause (C),
as a result of a breach by the Company which (y) is the result of fraud by
the Company and (z) would have or would reasonably be likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company),
or (D) (1) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) and (2)
an Acquisition Proposal shall at the time of such termination or thereafter
be publicly proposed or publicly announced (and not subsequently withdrawn)
and within six (6) months after such termination the Company consummates such
Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to
the Termination Fee (as hereinafter defined) by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account designated by Parent, in the case of a payment as a
result of any event referred to in Section 8.3(b)(iii)(D), within two (2)
business days after the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal, in the case
of a payment as a result of any event referred to in Section 8.3(b)(iii)(C),

and in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in Section

receive the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(iii)(C) or (D), the
amount of such fee shall be reduced by any amount paid to Parent under
Section 8.3(b)(i) or (ii) such that the maximum amount payable by the Company
in the event of a termination under Section 8.1(f) or 8.1(h) shall be
$20,000,000). For purposes of this Section 8.3(b), an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 9.11,
except that each reference to "20 percent" in such definition shall be deemed
to be a reference to "50 percent." As used in this Agreement, the "
_Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (x) Twenty
Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (the " _Base Amount_ ") and (y) the sum of (A)
the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without causing any of
the direct or indirect owners of Parent to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of
such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H)
and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined
by independent accountants to Parent, and (B) in the event Parent receives
an opinion or a letter from outside counsel (the " _Termination Fee Tax
Opinion_ ") indicating

  



  

51      
   



  

that Parent has received an opinion of counsel or a ruling from the
IRS holding that Parents receipt of the Base Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of Parent
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT
Requirements_ ") or that the receipt by Parent of the remaining balance of
the Base Amount following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would
not be deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Base Amount less the
amount payable under clause (A) above. In the event that Parent is not able
to receive the full Base Amount, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in
escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent unless and until
the Company receives either one of the following: (x) a letter from Parents
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at
that time to Parent without causing any of the direct or indirect owners
of Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements or (y) a Termination Fee
Tax Opinion, in either of which events the Company shall pay to Parent the
lesser of the unpaid Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter
referred to in clause (y) above. The Companys obligation to pay any unpaid
portion of the Termination Fee shall terminate three (3) years from the date
of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after such obligation
terminates shall be released to the Company.

  



  

### (c) In addition to any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b) above:

  

### 

  

#### (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company (other
than pursuant to Section 8.1(g)) or Parent for any reason, Parent shall be
entitled to (A) if the termination occurs before the Company commences the
Redemption by notice to stockholders or otherwise, a refund of the
Deposit together with any interest or other amounts earned with respect
thereto, or (B) if the termination occurs after the Company commences the
Redemption, in lieu of such cash payment, all of the Companys right, title
and interest in and to one (1) of the Company Properties listed in Section
8.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Identified Company
Property_ "). In the event that Parent is entitled to a refund of the
Deposit, the Company shall pay Parent the Deposit, together with any interest
or other amounts earned with respect thereto, by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account designated by Parent within five (5) business days after
termination. In the event that Parent is entitled to receive the Identified
Company Property, Parent shall promptly select the Identified Company
Property from among the Company Properties listed in Section 8.3(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (if Parent fails to notify the Company of its
selection within thirty (30) days after termination, the Company shall be
entitled to make such selection), and the Company shall, upon payment to the
Company of the amount (if any) by which the equity value of the Identified
Company Property exceeds $25,000,000, authorize, execute and deliver all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments, transfer documents and instruments and
take and do all such other actions and things as may be reasonably necessary
or desirable to carry out this Section 8.3(c)(i) and to transfer the
Identified Company Property to Parent consistent with the terms of this
Agreement. In the event that the equity value of the Identified
Company Property is less than $25,000,000, the Company shall pay Parent the
shortfall within five (5) business days after transfer of the property to

  



  

52      
   



  

Parent. The Identified Company Property shall have the equity value set forth
opposite its name in Section 8.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g), the Company shall be entitled to retain
the Deposit, together with any interest or other amounts earned with
respect thereto, and the Company Properties listed in Section 8.3(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. In such event, Parent shall authorize,
execute and deliver all such documents and instruments and take and do all
such other actions and things as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to
carry out this Section 8.3(c)(ii).

  

#### 

  

### (d) The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained
in Sections 8.3(b) and 8.3(c) above are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that the payments to be made
thereunder shall be compensation for the loss suffered by the applicable
party as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. The parties further agree
that termination of this Agreement and abandonment of the Merger contemplated
herein, with the consequences specifically provided for in this Section 8.3
in the case of such termination, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
any breach of the Companys representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, and that neither the Company nor any
of its officers, directors, employees, controlling stockholders, agents or
other representatives shall have any liability for damages arising out of,
resulting from or relating to any such breach; provided that, if this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(h), in addition to
any amounts payable by the Company under Sections 8.3(b) and 8.3(c), Parent
shall be entitled to seek all available remedies against the Company at law
or in equity, provided that in no event shall the Company be liable for
additional damages in excess of Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000).
Any amounts payable by the Company under Sections 8.3(b) and 8.3(c) shall not
be construed as a waiver by the Company of any claims it may have against
Parent for breach of this Agreement or otherwise.  In the event that the
Company or Parent is required to file to seek all or a portion of the amounts
payable under this Section 8.3, and such party prevails in such litigation,
such party shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all amounts that it
is otherwise entitled to receive under this Section 8.3, all reasonable
expenses (including attorneys fees) which it has incurred in enforcing its
rights hereunder, together with interest on the amounts owed at the prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. then in effect, which interest shall accrue from the
date such payment was required to be made until the date it was actually
received.

  

### 

  

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub at any time before or after approval of the
Merger by the Company Requisite Vote but, after such approval, no amendment
shall be made which requires the approval of any such stockholders under
applicable Law without such approvals.  This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other party

  



  

53      
   



  

contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance by the other party with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.  Any agreement on the
part of either party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
The failure of either party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.
