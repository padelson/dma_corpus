 **EXECUTION VERSION**

 



 

 **AMENDMENT NO. 1**

 

 **to**

 

 **PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **THIS AMENDMENT** (this " _Amendment_ "), is dated this 26th day of October,
2012, by and between Robert Bosch GmbH, a corporation organized under the laws
of Germany ( _Purchaser_ "), and SPX Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_SPX_ "). Capitalized terms used and not defined elsewhere in this Amendment
shall have the meanings given them in the Agreement.

 

 ** **

 

 **WHEREAS** , Purchaser and SPX are parties to that certain Purchase and Sale
Agreement dated as of January 23, 2012 (the " _Agreement_ "); and

 

 ** **

 

 **WHEREAS** , Purchaser and SPX desire to amend the Agreement in the manner
set forth below.

 

 ** **

 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises, the mutual agreements
hereinafter set forth, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, Purchaser and SPX agree as
follows:

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **Launch**

 



 

1.1. **_Launch Shares_. **The Agreement is hereby amended to eliminate the
provisions regarding the purchase and sale of the Launch Shares and to reduce
the Cash Purchase Price to $1,142,450,000. None of the statements to be
prepared and delivered pursuant to Sections 1.2(e) and 1.5 shall include any
amounts relating to the Launch Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, SPXs continued ownership of the Launch Shares or exercise of any of
its rights or performance of any of its obligations under the Launch
Agreements (as defined below) at any time after the Closing shall not
constitute a violation of Section 4.5(a).

 



 

1.2. **_Launch Agreements_. **Section 4.7 of the Agreement is hereby amended
to delete such section in its entirety and replace it with the phrase
"Intentionally Omitted", to reflect the fact that the Shareholders Agreement
and the Cooperation Agreement referred to therein (the " _Launch Agreements_
") are not being transferred to Purchaser.

 



 

1.3. **_Allocation of Purchase Price_**. _Exhibit 4_ to the Agreement is
hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with _Exhibit 4_ attached hereto.

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **Miscellaneous**

 



 

2.1. **_Continuation of Agreement_. **The Agreement, as amended hereby, shall
continue in full force and effect. Except as expressly amended by this
Amendment, the Agreement is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects.

      
 

 



 

2.2. **_Governing Law_. **This Amendment shall be governed in all respects in
accordance with the provisions of Section 12.8 of the Agreement, as amended.

 



 

2.3. **_Counterparts_**. This Amendment may be executed (including by
facsimile) in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, and each of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.
