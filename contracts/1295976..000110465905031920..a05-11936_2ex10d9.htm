## 

  

## Section 3.2. _Escrow Amount_. Notwithstanding anything to the

## 

  

### (a) Parent shall withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable

account designated in writing by the Escrow Agent.  The Escrow Amount will
be held by the Escrow Agent as partial security for the obligations of the
Former Company Stockholders to the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to the

## 

  

### (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully
paid and

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

### nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Company, as the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the capital stock of Merger Sub so converted, so that after the
Effective Time Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Company
Common Stock that are owned by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof and no consideration
shall be delivered or deliverable therefor.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Capital Stock of the Company_. At the Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than the Rollover Shares
or shares to be canceled in accordance with **Section 3.3(b) **and any
Dissenting Shares as defined in and to the extent provided in **Section
3.4**) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, in cash, an
amount equal to the result of (i) the sum of (A) the Merger Consideration and
(B) the aggregate amount of the exercise prices payable in respect of all in-
the-money Company Options (including any unvested portion of such Company
Options) and in-the-money Company Warrants, divided by (ii) the sum of (X)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Rollover Shares), (Y)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of in-the-money Company Options (including any unvested portion of such
Company Options), and (Z) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of in-the-money Company Warrants (the " ** _Per
Share Merger Consideration_** "). All such shares of Company Common Stock,
when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with and subject to the applicable terms and
conditions of **Section 3.5**, without any interest thereon.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, all then
outstanding options to purchase Company Common Stock, whether vested or
unvested (" ** _Company Options_** "), will be cancelled and automatically
converted into the right to receive, subject to the applicable terms and
conditions of **Section 3.5**, an amount in cash (without any interest
thereon), if positive, equal to the difference between (1) the Per Share
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore issuable upon exercise of such Company Option, reduced by
(2) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option for such shares,
subject to applicable withholdings (the " ** _Option Consideration_** "). Any
payment required pursuant to this **Section 3.3(d) **in connection with any
Company Options shall constitute a part of the Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, all then
outstanding warrants to purchase Company Common Stock (" ** _Company
Warrants_** ") which remain unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive,
upon surrender in accordance with and subject to the

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

### applicable terms and conditions of **Section 3.5**, in lieu of the
Company Common Stock theretofore issuable upon exercise of each such Company
Warrant, an amount in cash (without any interest thereon), if positive, equal
to the difference between (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied
by the number of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore issuable upon
exercise of such Company Warrant, reduced by (ii) the aggregate exercise
price of such Company Warrant (the " ** _Warrant Consideration_** ").  Any
payment required pursuant to this **Section 3.3(e) **in connection with any
Company Warrants shall constitute a part of the Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Net Working Capital Adjustment_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate signed by an officer of the
Company setting forth the Companys good faith determination of the estimated
Net Working Capital (" ** _Estimated Net Working Capital_** "). The Company
shall provide Parent access to such working papers and other information
reasonably available supporting such calculation of Estimated Net Working
Capital.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) If Actual Net Working Capital (as defined below) is less than the
Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Merger Consideration shall be reduced
dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such shortfall. If Actual Net Working
Capital is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Merger
Consideration shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such
difference.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
prepare or cause to be prepared a calculation of Net Working Capital
and deliver to the Former Company Stockholders Agent the calculation of
Net Working Capital and the adjustments, if any, required to be made to the
Merger Consideration pursuant to **Section 3.3(f)(ii)**. Parent shall
provide the Former Company Stockholders Agent access to such working papers
and other information reasonably available supporting such calculation of Net
Working Capital. If the calculation of the Net Working Capital delivered to
the Former Company Stockholders Agent is equal to or greater than the
Estimated Net Working Capital, Parent shall immediately prepare and
execute an instruction to the Escrow Agent to remit the full Working Capital
Escrow Amount to the Former Company Stockholders Agent to be disbursed to
the Former Company Stockholders. If the calculation of the Net Working
Capital delivered to the Former Company Stockholders Agent is less than the
Estimated Net Working Capital (the difference of such amounts being
hereinafter referred to as the **" _Shortfall_ "**), Parent shall immediately
prepare and execute an instruction to the Escrow Agent to remit the
difference, if positive, between (A) $3,000,0000 and (B) the Shortfall, to
the Former Company Stockholders Agent to be disbursed to the Former Company
Stockholders, and the balance of the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall
remain with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Working Capital
Escrow Agreement and this Section 3.3(f).

(30) days following the delivery of Parents calculation of Net Working
Capital to notify Parent in writing of any disagreements with
such calculation specifying in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any
such disagreement. Any item or amount not specifically objected to in

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

#### such notification shall be binding and conclusive on the parties. In the
event the Former Company Stockholders Agent timely notifies Parent of any
disagreement, Parent and the Former Company Stockholders Agent shall attempt
in good faith to resolve such disagreement. If within thirty (30) days after
delivery to Parent of the notification by the Former Company
Stockholders Agent of a disagreement, the parties are unable to resolve such
disagreement, either the Former Company Stockholders Agent, on the one hand,
or Parent, on the other hand, shall have the right to submit the
determination of such matters to an independent accountant of national
standing reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Former Company Stockholders
Agent (the " ** _Independent Auditor_** "), whose decision shall be binding
on the parties. The cost of the Independent Auditor and reasonable
attorneys fees of the other party shall be paid by the party whose aggregate
estimate of the disputed amount differs most greatly from the determination
of the Independent Auditor.  If the Former Company Stockholders are required
to pay the cost of the Independent Auditor then such costs shall be satisfied
by payment solely from the Working Capital Escrow Amount.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the dispute resolution
mechanism contained in this **Section 3.3(f) **shall be the exclusive
mechanism for resolving disputes regarding the Net Working Capital
adjustment, if any. For purposes of this **Section 3.3(f)**, **" _Actual Net
Working Capital_ " s**hall mean the Net Working Capital as finally determined
in accordance with this **Section 3.3(f)(iv)**.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) If it is finally determined pursuant to **Section 3.3(f)(iv) **that
the Merger Consideration paid at the Closing is less than the Merger
Consideration as adjusted pursuant to this **Section 3.3(f)**, Parent shall
remit such difference to the Paying Agent to be disbursed to the Former
Company Stockholders plus Parent shall immediately prepare and execute an
instruction to the Escrow Agent to remit the Working Capital Escrow
Amount, if any, to the Paying Agent to be disbursed to the Former Company
Stockholders.

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) If it is finally determined pursuant to **Section 3.3(f)(iv) **that
the Merger Consideration paid at the Closing is greater than the Merger
Consideration as adjusted pursuant to this **Section 3.3(f)**, such amount
shall be satisfied first by payment to Parent from the Working Capital Escrow
Amount with any shortfall to be satisfied by payment from the Former Company
Stockholders, on a several (but not joint) basis. If after such satisfaction
out of the Working Capital Escrow Amount, if any, there is a balance
remaining in the Working Capital Escrow Amount, Parent shall immediately
prepare and execute an instruction to the Escrow Agent to remit such balance
to the Paying Agent to be disbursed to the Former Company Stockholders.

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) Any cash payment to be made as a result of adjustments made in
accordance with this **Section 3.3(f)**, shall be paid within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination of such adjustments by wire transfer
of immediately available funds. Any such payment shall be made to such
account or accounts as may be designated by the party entitled to such
payment at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date that such payment is
to be made.

Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate signed by an officer of the
Company setting forth the Companys good faith determination of the estimated
Net Indebtedness (" ** _Estimated Net_**

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

#### ** _Indebtedness_** "). The Company shall provide Parent access to such
working papers and other information reasonably available supporting
such calculation of Estimated Net Indebtedness.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) If Actual Net Indebtedness (as defined below) is greater than the
Estimated Net Indebtedness, then the Merger Consideration shall be reduced
dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such difference and such amount shall be
satisfied by payment to Parent from the Former Company Stockholders, on a
several (but not joint) basis. If Actual Net Indebtedness is less than the
Estimated Net Indebtedness, then the Merger Consideration shall be increased
dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such shortfall and Parent shall remit such
difference to the Former Company Stockholders Agent to be disbursed to the
Former Company Stockholders.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
prepare or cause to be prepared a calculation of Net Indebtedness and deliver
to the Former Company Stockholders Agent such calculation of Net
Indebtedness and the adjustments, if any, required to be made to the Merger
Consideration pursuant to **Section 3.3(g)(ii)**. Parent shall provide the
Former Company Stockholders Agent access to such working papers and other
information reasonably available supporting such calculation of Net
Indebtedness.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) The Former Company Stockholders Agent will have a period of thirty
(30) days following the delivery of Parents calculation of Net Indebtedness
to notify Parent in writing of any disagreements with such
calculation specifying in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any
such disagreement. Any item or amount not specifically objected to in such
notification shall be binding and conclusive on the parties. In the event the
Former Company Stockholders Agent timely notifies Parent of any
disagreement, Parent and the Former Company Stockholders Agent shall attempt
in good faith to resolve such disagreement. If within thirty (30) days after
delivery to Parent of the notification by the Former Company Stockholders
Agent of a disagreement, the parties are unable to resolve such disagreement,
either the Former Company Stockholders Agent, on the one hand, or Parent, on
the other hand, shall have the right to submit the determination of such
matters to an Independent Auditor, whose decision shall be binding on the
parties. The cost of the Independent Auditor and reasonable attorneys fees
of the other party shall be paid by the party whose aggregate estimate of the
disputed amount differs most greatly from the determination of the
Independent Auditor. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
dispute resolution mechanism contained in this **Section 3.3(g) **shall be
the exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes regarding the Net
Indebtedness adjustment, if any. For purposes of this  **Section 3.3(g)**,
**" _Actual Net Indebtedness_ " s**hall mean the Net Indebtedness as finally
determined in accordance with this **Section 3.3(g)(iv)**.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) Any cash payment to be made as a result of adjustments made in
accordance with this **Section 3.3(g)**, shall be paid within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination of such adjustments by wire transfer
of immediately available funds. Any such payment shall be made to
such account or accounts as may be designated by the party entitled to such
payment at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date that such payment is
to be made.

#### (i) No later than 15 Business Days after both the Actual Net
Working Capital and Actual Net Indebtedness are finally determined in
accordance with Sections **3.3(f)(iv) and (g)(iv)**, respectively, the
Former Company Stockholders Agent shall prepare or cause to be prepared a
calculation of the tax benefit that may be received by Parent arising from
tax deductions attributable to payments made in connection with the
cancellation of the Company Options in the Merger (assuming for this purpose
that the Company will have sufficient income to use the entire deduction and
that the current tax rates remain in effect) (the **" _Closing Tax Benefit_
"**). Parent shall provide the Former Company Stockholders Agent access to
all financial and other information that it may reasonably request to
calculate the Closing Tax Benefit. The Former Company Stockholders Agent
shall provide Parent access to its working papers and other information
reasonably available supporting such calculation of the Closing Tax Benefit.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) If the Closing Tax Benefit is more than the Estimated Tax Benefit,
then the Merger Consideration shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the
amount of such difference and Parent shall remit such difference to the
Former Company Stockholders Agent to be disbursed to the Former Company
Stockholders. If the Closing Tax Benefit is less than the Estimated Tax
Benefit then the Merger Consideration shall be decreased dollar-for-dollar by
the amount of such difference and such amount shall be satisfied by payment
to Parent from the Former Company Stockholders, on a several (but not joint)
basis.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company or the
common parent of any affiliated group of which the Company may be a member to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to fully realize the entire amount of
the Closing Tax Benefit as promptly as possible and in compliance
with applicable law, including filing IRS Form 1139 and any comparable
state and local tax forms for the Companys tax year that will end on the
Closing Date, filing refund claims for prior tax years or reducing future
estimated tax payments and future tax payments based on actual tax liability.
If, after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company or the
common parent of any affiliated group of which the Company may be a member is
unable to fully utilize all of the deductions that form the basis of the
Closing Tax Benefit (the **" _Unused Portion_ "**), Parent shall provide the
Former Company Stockholders Agent with a good faith estimate of the Unused
Portion and access to such working papers and other information, including
prior tax returns, reasonably available to support such calculation of the
Unused Portion.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) The Former Company Stockholders Agent will have a period of 20
Business Days following the delivery of Parents calculation of the
Unused Portion to notify Parent in writing of any disagreements with such
calculation specifying in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any
such disagreement. Any item or amount not specifically objected to in such
notification shall be binding and conclusive on the parties. In the event the
Former Company Stockholders Agent timely notifies Parent of any
disagreement, Parent and the Former Company Stockholders Agent shall attempt
in good faith to resolve such disagreement. If within thirty (30) days after
delivery to Parent of the notification by the Former Company Stockholders
Agent of a disagreement, the parties are unable to resolve such disagreement,
either the Former Company Stockholders Agent, on the one hand, or Parent, on
the other hand, shall have the right to submit the determination of such
matters to an Independent Auditor, whose decision shall be binding on the
parties. The cost of the Independent Auditor and

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

#### reasonable attorneys fees of the other party shall be paid by the party
whose aggregate estimate of the disputed amount differs most greatly from the
determination of the Independent Auditor. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the dispute resolution mechanism contained in this **Section
3.3(h) **shall be the exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes regarding
the Unused Portion, if any. The amount of the Unused Portion, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 3.3(h)(iv) shall be referred to as the
**" _Agreed Upon Unused Portion_."**

  

#### 

  

#### (v) The Former Company Stockholders shall pay severally and not jointly
to Parent an amount equal to the Agreed Upon Unused Portion multiplied by the
tax rate used to calculate the Closing Tax Benefit.

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) If, following the payment made by the Former Company Stockholders
to Parent pursuant to Section 3.3(h)(v), the Company utilizes any of the
Agreed Upon Unused Portion, then Parent shall pay the amount of the tax
benefit derived from such utilization to the Former Company Stockholders
Agent to be disbursed to the Former Company Stockholders.

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) Any cash payments to be made as a result of this Section 3.3(h)
shall be paid within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of
such amounts by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Any such
payment shall be made to such account or accounts as may be designated by the
party entitled to such payment at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
date that such payment is to be made.

  

#### 

  

## Section 3.4. _Appraisal Rights_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has exercised such
holders appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, and
who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
appraisal rights (" ** _Dissenting Shares_** "), shall not be converted into
or represent a right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant
to **Section 3.3(a)**, but the holder of the Dissenting Shares shall only be
entitled to such appraisal rights as are granted by the DGCL.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of **Section 3.4(a)**, if any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock who demands his, her or its appraisal
rights with respect to such shares shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its rights to
receive payment for the fair market value of such shares under Section 262 of
the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of
such event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, as provided in **Section 3.3(c)
**upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

## Section 3.5. _Payment of Merger Consideration; Exchange of Certificates_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Former Company Stockholders Agent
shall designate, or shall cause to be designated, a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Parent to act as agent (the " ** _Paying Agent_**
") for the payment of the Merger Consideration (less the Escrow Amount,
the Working Capital Escrow Amount and the portion of the Merger
Consideration allocable to the Rollover Shares), and, at the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide to the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the amounts necessary for the payment of the Merger
Consideration (less the Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount
and the portion of the Merger Consideration allocable to the Rollover
Shares). Any and all interest or income earned on funds made available to the
Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (b) From and after the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate or
certificates (" ** _Certificates_** ") which represented shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
surrender each Certificate to the Paying Agent, and receive promptly
in exchange therefor the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration (less the
applicable portion of the Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow
Amount) into which the Company Common Stock evidenced by the Certificates so
surrendered shall have been converted pursuant, and subject to, the
provisions of **Article III** of this Agreement. The surrender of
Certificates shall be accompanied by duly completed and executed letters of
transmittal in such customary form as may reasonably be agreed to by the
Company and Parent. Until surrendered, each outstanding Certificate shall be
deemed for all corporate purposes from and after the Effective Time to
evidence the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration but shall,
subject to applicable appraisal rights under the DGCL and **Section 3.4** of
this Agreement, have no other rights. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Company of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (c) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Paying Agent shall
pay the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration (less the applicable
portion of the Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount) in
exchange therefor pursuant to the provisions of **Article III** of this
Agreement; provided, however, that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as
a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver an agreement of
indemnification (but without having to post a bond), in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, against any claim that may be made against Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

### 

  

### (d) At the Effective Time, each Optionholder shall receive from the
Paying Agent the applicable Option Consideration (less the applicable portion
of the Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount) into which the
Company Options shall have been converted pursuant, and subject to, the
provisions of **Article III** of this Agreement.

  



  

16   

     
   

  



  

### (e) From and after the Effective Time, each Warrantholder shall surrender
each Company Warrant to the Paying Agent, and receive promptly in exchange
therefor the applicable Warrant Consideration (less the applicable Escrow
Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount) into which the Company Warrant
so surrendered shall have been converted pursuant, and subject to, the
provisions of **Article III** of this Agreement. The surrender of
Company Warrants shall be accompanied by duly completed and executed letters
of transmittal in such customary form as may reasonably be agreed to by
the Company and Parent. Until surrendered, each outstanding Company Warrant
shall be deemed for all corporate purposes from and after the Effective Time
to evidence the right to receive the applicable Warrant Consideration but
shall have no other rights. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Company of
the Company Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (f) In the event any Company Warrant shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Company Warrant to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Paying Agent
shall pay the applicable Warrant Consideration (less the applicable portion
of the Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount) in exchange
therefor pursuant to the provisions of **Article III** of this
Agreement; provided, however, that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as
a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Warrant to deliver an agreement of
indemnification (but without having to post a bond), in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, against any claim that may be made against Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Warrant
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

### 

  

### (g) If any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration or Warrant
Consideration is to be paid to a Person (other than the Escrow Agent) other
than the Person in whose name the applicable Certificate or Company Warrant,
as the case may be, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that the Certificate or Company Warrant so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Company Warrant or establish to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  

### 

  

### (h) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to **Section 3.5(a) **that remains unclaimed six months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any holder
who has not surrendered Certificates or Company Warrants for the applicable
Per Share Merger Consideration or Warrant Consideration in accordance with
this **Section 3.5** prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of such applicable consideration, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any such holder
for any amounts paid to a Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable law
relating to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders two years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity)

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

### shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of
Parent, free and clear of any Liens of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to **Section 3.5(a) **to pay for shares of Company Common
Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to
Parent upon demand.

  

### 

  

### (i) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to any Person pursuant to this **Article III **such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent so withholds amounts, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options or
Company Warrants, as the case may be, in respect of which the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent made such deduction or withholding.

clause (i) above unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages
suffered by the Parent Indemnified Parties as a result of such breach(es)
exceeds in the aggregate the amount set forth as the Deductible in **Section
11.4** and then the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification only for such aggregate amount that exceeds the Deductible;
_provided_ , that the Deductible shall not apply to Damages incurred by
reason of the matters set forth in the letter dated as of the date hereof,
between the Company and Parent (Re: Indemnification Matters) (the **"

threshold shall not apply to Damages incurred by reason of the matters set
forth in the Indemnification Matters Letter; (c) the aggregate amount of all
payments to which the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive

entitled to seek indemnification for Damages to the extent that the items
giving rise to such Damages had been accounted for in any of the adjustments
to the Merger Consideration pursuant to **Sections 3.3(f), (g) and (h)**;

indemnification with respect to any Damages arising under clause (ii) above
unless and until (A) the aggregate amount of all Damages suffered by the
Parent Indemnified Parties under clause (ii) above exceeds in the aggregate
the amount set forth as the Schedule 4.16 Matters Deductible in **Section

Indemnified Parties under clauses (i) and (ii) above exceeds in the aggregate
the sum of the amount set forth as the Schedule 4.16 Matters Deductible
and the amount set forth as the Deductible in **Section 11.4**, and, then
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only for
such aggregate amount that exceeds the sum of the Schedule 4.16 Matters
Deductible and the Deductible.  In no event shall the Former Company
Stockholders be liable for any punitive, special or exemplary damages except

Indemnified Parties harmless against any Damages that the Stockholders
Indemnified Parties have incurred by reason of the inaccuracy or breach by
Parent or Merger Sub of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger
Sub contained in **Article V **of this Agreement (all such calculations of
Damages shall take into account any offset benefits or insurance proceeds
received in connection with the matter out of which such Damages shall arise
and shall take into account any tax benefits that the
Stockholders Indemnified Parties may receive in connection therewith). A
Former Company Stockholder shall be deemed to have waived, on behalf of all
Stockholders Indemnified Parties, any claim for Damages arising for
misrepresentation or breach of warranty if, prior to the Closing, such Former
Company Stockholder had actual knowledge and understanding of that
misrepresentation or breach (including potential consequences thereof).

Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to seek indemnification with
respect to any Damages unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages
suffered by the Stockholders Indemnified Parties as a result of such

entitled to indemnification only for such aggregate amount that exceeds the
Deductible; and (ii) the aggregate amount of all payments to which the
Stockholders Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive in satisfaction
of claims for indemnification pursuant to this **Section 11.2** shall in no
event exceed the amount set forth in **Section 11.4** as the Cap. In no
event shall Parent be liable for any punitive, special, consequential,
exemplary or incidental damages except to the extent actually payable by a
Stockholders Indemnified Party to a third party.

provided in this **Article XI**, subject to the final sentence of this
Section 11.3, from and after the Effective Time, no right, claim, remedy or
action shall be brought or maintained by any party, and no recourse shall be
brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any
alleged misstatement or omission respecting an inaccuracy in or breach of any
of the representations, warranties or covenants of any of the parties thereto
set forth or contained in this Agreement. All obligations of the Former
Company Stockholders pursuant to the terms of this **Article XI** shall be
satisfied first by payment from the Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this **Section 11.3** or otherwise in this Agreement, (i)
from and after the Effective Time, a claim may be brought based upon a breach
of the covenants set forth in **Sections 3.3(f), 3.3(g), 3.3(h), 8.5 or 8.6**
, and (ii) a claim based upon fraud may be brought, without regard to any
of the limitations set forth in this Agreement (including without regard to
any time or monetary limitations or any limitation on remedies),

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

## against any Person or Persons (or, in the case of the Company, the Former
Company Stockholders) accused of committing such fraud.

  

## 

  

## Section 11.4. _Deductible_ _and Cap_. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Former Company Stockholders
shall have any liability under this **Article XI** unless and until the
aggregate Damages for which indemnity by such party would otherwise be due
under **Article XI** exceeds $2,760,000 (the " ** _Deductible_** "), in
which case such indemnifying party shall only be responsible for the excess; 
_provided_ , that: (a) the Deductible shall not apply to Damages incurred by
reason of the matters set forth in the Indemnification Matters Letter; (b)
that a breach shall not be deemed to have occurred and the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall not be deemed to have incurred any Damages under clauses (i) or
(ii) of **Section 11.1** unless any Damages arising from such breach or
matter set forth on Schedule 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedules, as the
case may be, exceeds (together with all other claims for Damages so
substantially related as to effectively constitute one claim) $100,000;
provided, that such $100,000 threshold shall not apply to Damages incurred by
reason of the matters set forth in the Indemnification Matters Letter; (c)
that the Former Company Stockholders shall not have any liability with
respect to any Damages arising under clause (ii) of  **Section 11.1** unless
and until (A) the aggregate amount of all Damages suffered by the Parent
Indemnified Parties under clause (ii) of **Section 11.1** exceeds in the
aggregate $1,250,000 (the **" _Schedule 4.16 Matters Deductible_"**), and
(B) the aggregate amount of all Damages suffered by Parent Indemnified
Parties under clauses (i) and (ii) of  **Section 11.1** exceeds in
the aggregate the sum of the amount set forth as the Schedule 4.16
Matters Deductible and the amount set forth as the Deductible in this
**Section 11.4**, then the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification only for such aggregate amount that exceeds the sum of the
Schedule 4.16 Matters Deductible and the Deductible.  Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of
Parent or the Former Company Stockholders, as the case may be, under this
**Article XI** or **Section 8.6 **shall not exceed $25,000,000 (the " **
_Cap_** ").

  

## 

  

## Section 11.5. _Survival of_ _Indemnification Obligations_.
The indemnification obligations set forth in this **Article XI** shall
terminate upon the 547th day following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, (i) indemnification obligations with respect to Damages
incurred by reason of the matters set forth in the letter dated as of the
date hereof, between the Company and Parent (Re: Indemnification Matters)
shall terminate as set forth in the Indemnification Matters Letter; and (ii)
indemnification obligations set forth in this **Article XI** shall survive
the time at which they would otherwise terminate pursuant to this  **Section
11.5**, if notice of (x) the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such
obligations, (y) the aggregate amount of such Damages or an estimate thereof,
in each case to the extent known or determinable at such time, and (z)
reasonable detail of the individual items of such Damages included in the
amount so stated and the date, if known, each such item arose shall have been
given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such
time.

  

## 

  

## Section 11.6. _Terms and_ _Conditions of Indemnification; Resolution of
Conflicts_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Any party seeking indemnification for any third-party claim must give
the other party prompt notice of the claim for Damages (i) stating the
aggregate amount of the Damages or an estimate thereof, in each case to the
extent known or determinable at such time, and (ii) specifying in reasonable
detail the individual items of such Damages

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

### included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid
or properly accrued or arose, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach
or claim to which such item is related; provided, however, that the failure
to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any
obligation hereunder except where, and then solely to the extent that, such
failure actually and materially prejudices the rights of the indemnifying
party.

  

### 

  

### (b) The respective obligations and liabilities of the parties to
indemnify pursuant to this **Article XI** in respect of any Damages arising
from a claim by a third party shall be subject to the following additional
terms and conditions:

  

### 

  

#### (i) The indemnifying party shall have the right to undertake, by counsel
or other representatives of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party, the defense, compromise, and settlement of such claim.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) In the event that the indemnifying party shall elect not to
undertake such defense, or within thirty (30) days after notice of any such
claim from the indemnified party shall fail to defend, the indemnified party
(upon further written notice to the indemnifying party) shall have the right
to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim, by counsel
or other representatives of its own choosing, on behalf of and for the
account and risk of the indemnifying party.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this **Section 11.6** to the
contrary, (A) if there is a reasonable probability that a claim
may materially and adversely affect the indemnified party other than as a
result of money damages or other money payments, the indemnified party shall
have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense,
compromise or settlement of the claim, (B) the indemnifying party shall not,
without the indemnified partys written consent, settle or compromise any
claim or consent to entry of any judgment which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claiming party or the plaintiff
to the indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such
claim, and (C) in the event that the indemnifying party undertakes defense of
any claim, the indemnified party by counsel or other representative of its
own choosing and at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to
consult with the indemnifying party and its counsel or other representatives
concerning such claim and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party
and their respective counsel or other representatives shall cooperate with
respect to such claim, subject to the execution and delivery of a mutually
satisfactory joint defense agreement; provided, however, that if
representation of both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party by
the same counsel would create a conflict of interest, the reasonable costs
and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party shall
be paid by the indemnifying party.

  

#### 

  

### (c) If the Former Company Stockholders Agent or Parent shall object in
writing to any claim or claims by a Parent Indemnified Party or Stockholders
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, Parent or Former Company Stockholders
Agent, as the case may be, shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of
such objection to respond in a written statement to the objection. If after
such thirty (30) day period there remains a dispute as to any claims,
the Former Company Stockholders Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

### for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims.

  

### 

  

### (d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation,
either Parent or the Former Company Stockholders Agent may, by written
notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of
the damage or loss at issue is in pending litigation with a third party, in
which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event
the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators.
 Within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is sent, Parent (on the
one hand) and the Former Company Stockholders Agent (on the other
hand) shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected
shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators as to the
validity and amount of any made claim shall be solely decided in accordance
with the provisions of this **Article XI** and shall be binding and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in New
York, New York under the commercial rules then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall
pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of
the American Arbitration Association, and the expenses, including, without
limitation, the reasonable attorneys fees and costs, incurred by the
prevailing party to the arbitration.

  

### 

  

## Section 11.7. _Former_ _Company Stockholders  Agent_.

  

## 

  

### (a) In the event that the Merger is approved by the stockholders of the
Company, effective upon such vote, and without further act of any stockholder
of the Company, Charter Agent LLC shall be appointed as agent and attorney-
in-fact (the " ** _Former Company Stockholders  Agent_**") for each
Optionholder, Warrantholder and stockholder of the Company (except
such stockholders of the Company, if any, as shall have perfected their
appraisal or dissenters rights under the DGCL). The Former Company
Stockholders Agent shall have the authority to act for and on behalf of the
Former Company Stockholders, including, without limitation, to give
and receive notices and communications, to act on behalf of the Former
Company Stockholders with respect to any matters arising under this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents, to authorize delivery to Parent of any
funds and property in its possession or in the Escrow Amount or the Working
Capital Escrow Amount in satisfaction of claims by Parent Indemnified
Parties, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and commence, prosecute, participate in,
settle, dismiss or otherwise terminate, as applicable, lawsuits and claims,
mediation and arbitration proceedings, and to comply with orders of courts
and awards of courts, mediators and arbitrators with respect to such suits,
claims or proceedings, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Former Company Stockholders Agent for the accomplishment
of the foregoing. The Former Company Stockholders Agent shall for all
purposes be deemed the sole authorized agent of the Former Company
Stockholders until such time as the agency is terminated. Such agency may be
changed by the Former Company Stockholders from time to time upon not less
than 30 days prior written

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

### notice to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Former Company
Stockholders Agent may not be removed unless holders of a two-
thirds interest in the Merger Consideration agree to such removal and to the
identity of the substituted Former Company Stockholders Agent. Any vacancy
in the position of Former Company Stockholders Agent may be filled by
approval of the holders of a majority in interest of the Merger
Consideration. No bond shall be required of the Former Company Stockholders
Agent, and the Former Company Stockholders Agent shall not receive
compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the
Former Company Stockholders Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of
the Former Company Stockholders during the term of the agency.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Former Company Stockholders Agent shall not incur any liability
with respect to any action taken or suffered by it or omitted hereunder as
Former Company Stockholders Agent while acting in its capacity as Former
Company Stockholders Agent. The Former Company Stockholders Agent may, in
all questions arising hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel and
other professionals and for anything done, omitted or suffered by the Former
Company Stockholders Agent shall not be liable to anyone while acting as
Former Company Stockholders Agent. The Former Company Stockholders Agent
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically
set forth in this Agreement and no other covenants or obligations shall be
implied under this Agreement against the Former Company Stockholders Agent;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall not act as a limitation on
the powers of the Former Company Stockholders Agent determined by it to be
reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of its obligations. The Former
Company Stockholders shall indemnify the Former Company Stockholders Agent
and hold it harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred on the
part of the Former Company Stockholders Agent and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of their duties hereunder
under this Agreement.  The Former Company Stockholders Agent shall be
entitled to satisfy any such loss, liability and expense from the proceeds of
the Working Capital Escrow Amount and/or the Escrow Amount received by the
Former Company Stockholders Agent for distribution to the Former Company
Stockholders on a pro rata basis.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Former Company Stockholders Agent shall have reasonable access
to information about the Company and Parent and the reasonable assistance of
the Surviving Corporations and Parents officers and employees for purposes
of performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that
the Former Company Stockholders Agent shall treat confidentially and not
disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Surviving Corporation or
Parent to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to
treat such information confidentially).

  

### 

  

### (d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Former Company
Stockholders Agent shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction
of all of the Former Company Stockholders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Former Company Stockholder. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Former Company Stockholders Agent as being the decision,
act, consent or instruction of every such Former Company Stockholder.
