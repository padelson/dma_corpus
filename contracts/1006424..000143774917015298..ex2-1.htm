the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Bear State Common Stock:

 



 

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. All shares of Bear State Common
Stock that are owned by Bear State as treasury stock shall be cancelled or
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Bear State Common Stock_. Each share of Bear State
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ and
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration. All such shares of Bear State Common Stock converted in
accordance with this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration into which such
Bear State Common Stock has been converted.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) _Acquisition Capital Stock_. Each share of Acquisition common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof into an equal number of shares of the Surviving Corporation, which
shares shall constitute all of the outstanding common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the

such right as of the Effective Time (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be

Consideration specified in _Section 3.1(b)_ hereof, but instead, the holders
thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section
4-27-1302 of the ABCA. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall fail to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the
Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall thereupon be treated as though
such Dissenting Shares had been converted into the right to receive the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to which such holder would be
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ hereof. Bear State shall give
Acquisition prompt notice upon receipt by Bear State of any such written
demands for payment of the fair value of shares of Bear State Common Stock and

Surviving Corporation.

 



 

3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_ _and Payment_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Arvest shall cause
Acquisition to deposit, in a segregated non-interest bearing account at Arvest

Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Arvest and Bear State may reasonably specify) and

Bear State Certificates in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration.
With respect to each holder of Bear State Common Stock, upon surrender of a
Bear State Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as the Paying
Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Bear State Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Bear State Common
Stock represented by the certificate so surrendered pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article III_ , and the Bear State Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_
_3.3_ , each Bear State Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Bear State Common Stock
represented by such Bear State Certificate. With respect to each Warrant
Holder, upon cancellation of such Warrants pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ and
delivery of the letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents

Holder on the Closing Financial Certificate. With respect to each Option
Holder and RSU Holder, upon cancellation of such options or RSUs pursuant to

documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the Option Holder or RSU
Holder, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the
amount set forth for such Option Holder or RSU Holder on the Closing Financial
Certificate.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the payment procedures described in _Section
3.3(b)(i)_ above, in the event that a holder of Bear State Certificates
surrenders such Bear State Certificates and a properly executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and such Bear State Certificates entitle the holder to receive
not less than $1,000,000 pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 3.3(b)_ ,
then, immediately following the Closing, Arvest shall cause the Paying Agent
to deliver to such holder of such Bear State Certificates an amount equal to
the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to such shareholder pursuant to
_Section_ _ 3.1(b)_ by, at the option of such holder, (A) delivery of a bank
cashier's check payable to such holder, (B) a direct deposit into such
holder's account at the Bank or (C) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by such holder.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in_ _Bear State_ _Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of shares of Bear State Common Stock
in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Bear State Common
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Bear State Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Bear State Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_.

 



 

(d) _Lost or Stolen Certificate_. In the event that any Bear State
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall

exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, together with such other
documents required under _Section 3._ _3_ _(_ _b_ _)_ ; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of cash, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate to submit to the Paying Agent a bond in a form and substance
satisfactory to the Paying Agent, or an indemnification agreement in a form
acceptable to Arvest, whereby such shareholder agrees to indemnify Arvest and
the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against Arvest,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, in lieu of such certificates.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Fund;_ _Limit of Liability_. Any portion of the
cash funds deposited in a segregated account pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ that
remains undistributed to the shareholders, Option Holders, Warrant Holders, or
RSU Holders of Bear State for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
distributed from the segregated account to Arvest, and any shareholders,
Option Holders, Warrant Holders or RSU Holders of Bear State who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to
Arvest for payment of their claim for the Per Share Merger Consideration or
other consideration paid pursuant to this Agreement. None of Arvest,
Acquisition, Bear State or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of shares of Bear State Common Stock or options, Warrants or RSUs for
any portion of such cash funds that are delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(f) _Withholding_. The letter of transmittal described in _Section 3._
_3_ _(_ _b_ _)_ above will include a Substitute Form W-9 pursuant to which
each Bear State Shareholder and Warrant Holder may certify that such Person is
not subject to backup withholding. Subject to such Person making such
certification and delivering the Substitute Form W-9 with such Person's letter
of transmittal, the Person shall not be subject to any withholding with
respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration or any other consideration paid
or payable pursuant to this Agreement. However, if the Person is unable or
fails to provide the Substitute Form W-9, Arvest shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Bear State Common Stock, Dissenting
Shares, or Warrants such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state or local tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Arvest, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Bear State Common Stock, Dissenting
Shares, or Warrants in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Arvest. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Arvest and
their respective agents shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amount set forth for each Option Holder and RSU Holder on the Closing
Financial Certificate such amounts as the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, Arvest and their respective agents reasonably and in good faith
determine are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to each option
and RSU, including, but not limited to, social security, medicare, federal or
state income tax, or any other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to
federal, state, local or foreign tax Law.

except as described in _Schedule 4.12(b)_ of the Bear State Disclosure
Schedule, no former employee of either Bear State or the Bank is eligible for
benefits under any medical plan sponsored by Bear State or the Bank under
COBRA.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) _Schedule 4.12(c)_ of the Bear State Disclosure Schedule describes
each: (i) agreement with any current or former shareholder, director,
executive officer or other key employee of Bear State or the Bank (A) the
benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are materially
altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving Bear State or the Bank
of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B)
providing any terms of employment or compensation guarantee, or (C) providing
severance benefits or other benefits after the termination of employment of
any director, executive officer or key employee; (ii) agreement, plan or
arrangement under which any Person may receive payments from Bear State or the
Bank that may be subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or
included in the determination of such Person's "parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Code; and (iii) agreement or plan binding Bear State or
the Bank, including, without limitation, any stock option plan, stock
appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan, stock purchase plan,
severance benefit plan, or any Bank employee plans, any of the benefits of
which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be
accelerated, by the occurrence of any transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on
the basis of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(d) None of Bear State, the Bank, any Employee Plan or, to the Knowledge
of Bear State, any fiduciary of such plan has incurred any liability to the
Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the
coverage of any employees of Bear State or the Bank under any Employee Plan
that has not been satisfied in full.

 



 

(e) Full payment has been made (or proper accruals have been established
to the extent required by GAAP) of all contributions which are required for
periods prior to the date hereof, and full payment will be so made (or proper
accruals will be so established to the extent required by GAAP) of all
contributions which are due and payable after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date, under the terms of each of the Employee Plans or ERISA.

 



 

(f) Each of the Employee Plans has been established and maintained in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code, all regulations, rulings and announcements promulgated or issued
thereunder and all other applicable governmental Laws. With respect to each
Employee Plan, any related trust is exempt from federal income Tax under
Section 501(a) of the Code and no event has occurred that reasonably could
result in the loss of such Tax exemption or to liability for any Tax under
Section 511 of the Code. Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code either: (i) has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, (ii) is the
subject of a pending determination request made to the Internal Revenue
Service, or (iii) is subject to an opinion letter with respect to a
preapproved document which is in force and upon which such plan may rely and
nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of
such qualification. No condition or circumstance exists giving rise to a
material likelihood that any such Employee Plan would not be treated as
qualified by the Internal Revenue Service.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.12(g)_ of the Bear State Disclosure
Schedule, neither Bear State nor the Bank has at any time ever maintained,
established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to any plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. The "frozen" "multiemployer
plan" maintained by Bank is not in either "critical and declining status,"
"critical status" or "endangered status," as such terms are defined in ERISA.
Neither Bear State, the Bank, nor any officer or director of Bear State or the
Bank is subject to any material liability or penalty under Section 4975
through 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code or Title I of ERISA. No "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406
and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 4975 of the Code and
Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan which
could subject Bear State or the Bank to material liability.

 



 

(h) There are no labor disputes between Bear State and the Bank and any of
their respective employees which in the aggregate might have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Bear State nor the Bank is the subject of any pending
organization effort or representation election by or with respect to a labor
union.

 



 

(i) Except as disclosed on _Schedule 4.12(i)_ , to the Knowledge of Bear
State, all employees of Bear State or the Bank are bondable, have never been
convicted of or charged with a financial crime. _Schedule 4.12(i)_ lists all
employees who have been terminated within the last five (5) years due to the
failure to be bonded or having been formally charged with, or convicted of, a
financial crime.

 



 

4.13 _Certain Contracts_.

(either alone or in connection with the occurrence of any additional acts or
events), and other than the Employee Plans; (iv) any agreement, arrangement or
understanding pursuant to which either Bear State or the Bank is obligated to
indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of Bear State or the Bank;

the Bank is a party or by which either of the same is bound which limits the
freedom of Bear State or the Bank to compete in any line of business or with
any Person; (vi) any supervisory agreement, memorandum of understanding,
consent order, cease and desist order or condition of any regulatory order or
decree with or by an applicable Governmental Entity; (vii) any lease of real

Assessment and Management Memorandum as of September 30, 2016, dated October
12, 2016, previously delivered to Arvest and also attached on _Schedule
4.13(b)_ contains true and accurate information.

 



 

(c) Neither Bear State nor the Bank is in default or in non-compliance,
which default or non-compliance could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, under any contract, agreement, commitment,
arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument to which it is a
party or by which its assets, business or operations may be bound or affected,
whether entered into in the ordinary course of business or otherwise and
whether written or oral, and there has not occurred any event that with the
lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute such a
default or non-compliance.

 



 

4.14 _Brokers and Finders_. Except as may be described on _Schedule
4.14_ of the Bear State Disclosure Schedule, neither Bear State nor the Bank
(or any of their directors, officers, employees or agents) has employed any

brokerage fees, commissions or finder's fees, and no broker or finder has
acted directly or indirectly for Bear State or the Bank in connection with
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

4.15 _Insurance_. Each of Bear State and the Bank is insured and,
during each of the past three (3) calendar years, has been insured, for
reasonable amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance companies

thereunder. All of the policies and bonds maintained by Bear State and the
Bank are in full force and effect and shall continue in full force and effect
through the Closing Date, and all claims thereunder have been filed in a due
and timely manner, and no such claim has been denied. Neither Bear State nor
the Bank has been notified that its fidelity or insurance coverage will not be
renewed by the carrier(s) on substantially the same terms as its existing
coverage.

 



 



 

 



   



 

4.16 _Properties_. All real and personal property owned by Bear State
and the Bank or presently used by them in their businesses, other than OREO,
have been well maintained and are in good operating condition and repair
(ordinary wear and tear excepted) sufficient to carry on the business of Bear
State and the Bank in the ordinary course of business consistent with their
past practices. All OREO currently owned by the Bank has been generally
maintained in reasonably good condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices.
Either Bear State or the Bank, as applicable, has good and marketable title,
free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, charges, defaults or equities
(other than equities of redemption under applicable foreclosure Laws or of

due or payable, (b) pledges to secure deposits and other liens incurred in the
ordinary course of the Bank's banking business, and (c) such imperfections of

State or the Bank is held pursuant to leases or licenses which are valid and
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, and such leases will
not terminate or lapse prior to the Closing. _Schedule_ _4.1_ _6_ of the Bear
State Disclosure Schedule sets forth separate descriptions (by address) of all
real property owned and all real property leased by Bear State or the Bank,
each as lessee, and used in the conduct of their business as of the date of
this Agreement, other than OREO.

 



 

4.17 _Transactions with Affiliates_. Except as may be described in
_Schedule 4.17_ of the Bear State Disclosure Schedule, there are no existing
or pending transactions, nor are there any agreements or understandings, with
any directors, officers or employees of Bear State or the Bank or any person
or entity affiliated with Bear State or the Bank (collectively, " _Affiliates_
"), relating to, arising from or affecting Bear State or the Bank, including,
without limitation, any transactions, arrangements or understandings relating
to the purchase or sale of goods or services, the lending of monies or the
sale, lease or use of any assets of Bear State or the Bank except for (a)
current salary and business expense advances consistent with past practices,

at the Bank.

 



 



 

 



   



 

4.18 _Loans and Allowance_.

 



 

(a) Each loan on the books and records of Bear State and the Bank,
including, without limitation, unfunded portions of outstanding lines of
credit and loan commitments: (i) was made and has been serviced in all
material respects in accordance with the Bank's lending standards in the
ordinary course of business; (ii) is evidenced by appropriate and sufficient
documentation; (iii) constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the obligor named therein, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance and other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditor's rights and to general equity principles; and (iv) is not subject to
any known defense, offsets or counterclaims that might be asserted against
Bear State or the Bank. The credit files of Bear State and the Bank contain
all material information known to Bear State or the Bank that is reasonably
required to evaluate, in accordance with generally prevailing practices in the
banking industry, the collectability of the loan portfolio of Bear State or
the Bank. With respect to any loan or other evidence of indebtedness all or a
portion of which has been sold or guaranteed by any Governmental Entity,
including the Small Business Administration and the USDA Farm Service Agency,
each of such loans was made in compliance and conformity in all material
respects with all relevant Laws and procedures such that such Governmental
Entity's guarantee of such loan is, to the Knowledge of Bear State, effective
during the term of such loan. All extensions of credit made to any insider of
the Bank (within the meaning of such terms in Regulation O of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System) have been made by the Bank in an
arms' length manner made on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with other persons and do not involve more than normal risk of
collectability or present other unfavorable features.

 



 

(b) The loans comprising the loan portfolio of the Bank have been made in
the normal course of business and are documented in material compliance with
all applicable federal and state Laws. _Schedule 4.1_ _8(b)_ contains a true,
correct and complete listing as of June 30, 2017, by account, of: (i) all
loans in excess of $100,000 of the Bank which have been accelerated during the
past twelve (12) months, other than foreclosures; (ii) all loan commitments or
lines of credit of the Bank in excess of $100,000 which have been terminated
by Bank during the past twelve (12) months by reason of default or adverse
developments in the condition of the borrower; (iii) all loans, lines of
credit and loan commitments in excess of $100,000 as to which the Bank has
given written notice of its intention to terminate in the past twelve (12)
months, other than foreclosures; (iv) all loans in excess of $100,000 (A) that
are contractually past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or
interest, (B) that are on non-accrual status, (C) that have been classified
internally or by an examiner as other than "pass," (D) for which a reasonable
doubt exists, in the reasonable judgment of Bank that the timely future
collectability of principal and/or interest is impaired, (E) where the
interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been
extended subsequent to the agreement under which the loan was originally
created due to concerns regarding the borrower's ability to pay in accordance
with such initial terms or (F) where a specific reserve allocation exists in
connection therewith (items (i) - (iv) above collectively referred to as
"Nonperforming Assets"); (v) all loans or debts payable or owing to Bank by
any executive officer or director or principal shareholder of Bank or any
Subsidiary or any other Person deemed an "executive officer" or a "related
interest" of any of the foregoing, as such terms are defined in Regulation O
of the Federal Reserve Board; (vi) all loans sold during the past thirty-six
(36) months; (vii) all loans previously sold which have been put back or
threatened to be put back by any purchaser or other person, including any
government sponsored enterprise; and (viii) all OREO.

Disclosure Schedule lists all material Intellectual Property of Bear State and
the Bank. Either Bear State or the Bank, as applicable, owns all right, title

in), free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance of any kind, and, except
as set forth on _Schedule 4.19_ of the Bear State Disclosure Schedule has the
valid and enforceable right to use and fully and completely assign, transfer
and convey, all material Intellectual Property currently used or planned to be
used in such party's business or otherwise reasonably necessary to carry on
such party's business. The activities, products and services of Bear State and
the Bank have not and do not infringe upon, misappropriate, dilute (in the
case of trademarks) and/or otherwise violate, or constitute the unauthorized
use of, the Intellectual Property of any other Person. There are no written
or, to the Knowledge of Bear State, oral allegations, threats or claims, and
there are no lawsuits pending or, to the Knowledge of Bear State, threatened,
in any case, alleging that any of Bear State or the Bank's activities,

4.21 _Anti-Money Laundering_. Bear State has no Knowledge of, has not
been advised of, and has no reason to believe that any facts or circumstances
exist that could reasonably be expected to cause Bear State or the Bank to be
deemed to be operating in violation in any respect of the Bank Secrecy Act,
the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by
the UST's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money
laundering statute, rule or regulation or any license, order or regulation
issued with respect to economic sanctions programs by the UST's Office of
Foreign Assets Control. The Board of Directors of each of Bear State and the
Bank have adopted and implemented an anti-money laundering program that

Affiliates or agents, will directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or
participate in negotiations with any Person other than Arvest or Acquisition
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, nor shall Bear State or the Bank, or
any of their respective Affiliates or agents provide any information
concerning Bear State or the Bank with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , this _Section 7.4(a)_ shall not prohibit Bear State or its Board
of Directors from furnishing information regarding Bear State or the Bank to,
entering into a confidentiality agreement with or entering into discussions
with, any Person in response to an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a

violated any of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.4_, (ii) the

any such nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, Bear State gives Arvest written notice of the
identity of such Person and of Bear State's intention to furnish nonpublic
information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person,
and (B) Bear State receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all
written and oral information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Bear
State, which confidentiality agreement shall contain provisions not materially
less restrictive than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and
(iv) contemporaneously with furnishing any such information to such Person,
Bear State furnishes such information to Arvest (but only to the extent such
information has not been previously furnished or made available to Arvest).
Bear State and the Bank will immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ _7._ _4_ _(a)_ by any officer or director of Bear State or the Bank

State or the Bank shall be deemed to be a breach by Bear State of this

inquiry. Bear State will keep Arvest informed in all material respects of the
status and details (including, without limitation, material amendments or

State from, prior to a favorable vote of the Bear State Shareholders,
withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation in favor of
adopting and approving this Agreement and the Merger or from not including its

Merger in the Proxy Materials if (i) a Superior Proposal (as determined by the
Board of Directors of Bear State in good faith) is made to Bear State and not
withdrawn; (ii) neither Bear State nor any of its representatives shall have
violated any of the restrictions set forth in _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.4_
; and (iii) the Board of Directors of Bear State concludes in good faith,
after consultation with and receiving advice from its outside counsel, that,
in light of such Superior Proposal, that the Board's failure to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify such recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to Bear State's shareholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to any withholding, withdrawal, amendment
or modification of the Bear State Board's recommendation, Bear State shall
have given Arvest at least five (5) Business Days' notice thereof and the
opportunity to meet with Bear State and its financial advisors and counsel to
negotiate with Arvest in good faith (to the extent Arvest desires to so
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the judgment
of the Board of Directors of Bear State) a Superior Proposal. Nothing
contained in this _Section 7.4(c)_ shall limit Bear State's obligation to hold
and convene the Bear State Shareholders Meeting (regardless of whether the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Bear State shall have been
withheld, withdrawn, amended or modified). In addition to the foregoing, Bear
State shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition
Proposal other than the Merger or enter into any acquisition agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger prior to the Bear
State Shareholders Meeting.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit Bear State or
the Board of Directors of Bear State from complying with Bear State's
obligations required under Rule 14d-5 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 



 

7.5 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date through the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Arvest (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each director, officer and employee of Bear State or the Bank
(in each case when acting in such capacity) (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing Date, only and to the fullest extent to
which Bear State or the Bank is or was required by Law or their respective
articles of incorporation or bylaws to indemnify such Indemnified Parties and
in the manner to which it could indemnify such parties under the Law or the
articles of incorporation or bylaws of Bear State and the Bank, in each case
as in effect on the date hereof, provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
7.5(a)_ , upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially
prejudice the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there
are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which
is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction); (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter;
(iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent; and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have
no obligation hereunder in the event that a Bank Regulator or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Bear
State shall obtain and provide to Arvest such information as Arvest shall
reasonably request regarding an extension of the reporting period under Bear
State's or the Bank's existing directors' and officers' liability coverage for
acts and omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date, including the cost
associated with purchasing extended coverage for a six-year period under
substantially the current terms of Bear State's or the Bank's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance. For a period of six (6) years
after the Closing Date, Arvest shall cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
Bear State or the Bank (provided, that Arvest may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at
or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Arvest shall not be
obligated to expend, in the aggregate, an annual amount more than 150% of the
current annual amount expended by Bear State and the Bank, determined
collectively (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Arvest shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in Arvest's good faith determination,
provide the maximum coverage available at an amount equal to the Premium Cap.
In lieu of the foregoing, Bear State or the Bank, in consultation with, but
only upon the consent of Arvest, may obtain at or prior to the Closing Date a
six-year "tail" policy under Bear State's or the Bank's existing directors'
and officers' insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described
in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained
for an amount that does not exceed the Premium Cap.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.5_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and to grant third party
rights to, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives.

 



 

7.6 _Press Releases_. Arvest and Bear State shall agree with each
other as to the form and substance of any press release related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and consult with each other
as to the form and substance of other public disclosures which may relate to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained herein shall limit or prohibit either party, following
notification to the other party, from making any disclosure which it
determines in good faith is required by Law or by the rules or listing
standards of any applicable securities exchange.

 



 

7.7 _Current Information_.

 



 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, Bear
State and the Bank shall, upon the request of Arvest, cause one or more of its
designated representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of Arvest regarding its financial condition, operations,
business and prospects and matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Concurrently with the filing
thereof, Bear State will deliver to Arvest copies of the regular and periodic
reports filed by Bear State and the Bank with their Bank Regulators. As soon
as reasonably available, but in no event more than fifteen (15) days after the
end of each calendar quarter ending after the date of this Agreement, Bear
State will deliver to Arvest an unaudited condensed consolidated statement of
financial condition and an unaudited condensed consolidated statement of
income for such quarter and the same quarter in the preceding year prepared in
accordance with GAAP (excluding footnotes and other presentation items).

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including
_Section 6.4(c)_ and this _Section 7.7_ ), neither Bear State nor the Bank
shall be required to provide Arvest with any documents or access to any
proceedings or meetings that disclose or involve the discussion of
confidential information relating to negotiation of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter that Bear State's or the
Bank's board of directors has been advised by counsel that such provision of
documents or access to Arvest may violate a confidentiality obligation or
fiduciary duty or any Law, or may result in a waiver of Bear State's or the
Bank's attorney-client privilege.

 



 

7.8 _Disclosure Supplements_. From time to time prior to the
Effective Time, Bear State and Arvest shall promptly supplement or amend any
materials previously disclosed and delivered to the other party pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to any matter arising after the date hereof which,
if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in writing to such party or which is
necessary to correct any information in such prior disclosure which has been
rendered inaccurate thereby; _provided_ , no such supplement or amendment
shall be deemed to have modified the representations, warranties and covenants
for the purpose of determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article_
_VIII_ hereof have been satisfied.

 



 

7.9 _Conforming Accounting Adjustments_. Bear State shall, if
requested in writing by Arvest, consistent with GAAP, applicable banking and
securities Law, and the rules or listing standards of any applicable
securities exchange, immediately before Closing, make such accounting entries
as Arvest may reasonably request in order to conform the accounting records of
Bear State to the accounting policies and practices of Arvest. No such
adjustment by Bear State or the Bank shall of itself constitute or be deemed
to be a breach, violation or failure by Bear State or the Bank to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of this
Agreement or constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement by Arvest or
be an acknowledgment by Bear State of any adverse circumstances for purposes
of determining whether the conditions to Arvest's obligations under this
Agreement have been satisfied.

 



 

7.10 _Employee Plan Termination_. Promptly following receipt of a
written request from Arvest, Bear State and the Bank shall take all action
necessary on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, (a) to
terminate the 401(k) Plan sponsored by Bear State and/or the Bank causing each
participant's accounts thereunder to be fully vested; and (b) to terminate any
other employee benefit plan as requested by Arvest.

 



 

7.11 _Failure to Fulfill Conditions_. Each party will promptly inform
the other party or parties of any facts applicable to it that would be likely
to prevent or materially delay approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby by any Governmental Entity or third party or which would otherwise
prevent or materially delay completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION, WAIVER AND AMENDMENT

to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual consent in writing of Arvest and Bear State;

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) by Arvest in writing if either Bear State or the Bank has, or by Bear
State in writing if either Arvest or Acquisition has, (i) breached any
covenant or undertaking contained herein, or (ii) breached any representation
or warranty contained herein or such representation or warranty ceases to be
true and correct, in each case, which breach or failure to be true and
correct, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches or
failure of such representations to be true and correct, would constitute, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of one or more
conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a),_ _Section 8.2(b),_ _Section 8.3(a)_
or _Section 8.3(b)_ , as the case may be, provided, in each case, such breach
or failure of such representation or warranty to be true and correct is
incapable of cure or has not been cured within thirty (30) days following the
giving of written notice of such breach or failure of such representation or
warranty to be true and correct to the breaching party;

 



 

(c) by Arvest or Bear State in writing, if any of the applications for
prior approval referred to in _Section 6._ _2_ hereof are denied or are
approved in a manner which does not satisfy the requirements of _Section_ _8_
_.1(b)_ hereof, and the time period for appeals and requests for
reconsideration has run, unless the failure of such occurrence shall be due to
the failure of the party seeking to terminate to perform or observe its
agreements set forth herein to be performed or observed by such party at or
before the Closing;

 



 

(d) by Arvest or Bear State if the shareholders of Bear State fail to vote
their approval of the matters relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby at the Bear State Shareholders Meeting where such matters
were presented to such shareholders for approval and voted upon;

 



 

(e) by Arvest in the event that the Board of Directors of Bear State has

in the Bear State Recommendation, (ii) breached its obligations under _Section
7.2_ by failing to call, give notice of, establish a record date for, convene,
and/or hold the Bear State Shareholders Meeting in accordance with _Section
7.2_ , or (iii) breached its obligations under _Section 7.4_ in any respect
adverse to Arvest;

 



 

(f) by Arvest or Bear State in writing, if the Closing has not occurred by
the close of business on the 270th day following the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that such date may be extended by 90 days by (i) either Arvest or
Bear State by written notice to the other party if a reason the Closing shall
not have occurred is because of failure to obtain a regulatory approval, or
(ii) Arvest if a Bank Regulator requires Arvest to divest or dispose of any
branch banking offices (or business, assets, deposits or liabilities) of the
Bank (or of Arvest in lieu thereof), including those located in Washington
County, Benton County or Boone County, Arkansas as part of the regulatory
approval received from such Bank Regulator, in order to permit Arvest
sufficient time to enter into one or more agreement(s) to sell such branch(es)
on or before such date; _provided_ , that this right to terminate shall not be
available to any party whose failure to perform one or more obligations under
this Agreement has been the direct and principal cause of, or directly and
principally resulted in, the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated by such date.

 



 



 

 



   



 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9_ _.1_

this _Section_ _9_ _.2_ and _Article X_ in its entirety shall survive any such
termination; (ii) such termination shall not affect the obligations of any of
the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement; and (iii) such termination

(b) Bear State shall pay to Arvest a termination fee in the amount of
$14,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), if this Agreement is terminated:

State or the Bank, directly to the shareholders of Bear State generally or any
Person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Bear State or the Bank; and

 



 

(B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, Bear State or the Bank enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above),

 



 

 _provided_ , _that_ , solely for the purposes of this _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ ,

(d) Bear State and the Bank acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this _Section_ _9_ _.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without such agreements, Arvest would not have
entered into this Agreement, and that such amounts do not constitute a
penalty. The parties agree that the Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Arvest (including any remedy for specific performance) for
any losses or damages incurred by Arvest arising from the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to any section giving rise to Bear State's obligation to
pay such amount, as agreed-upon liquidated damages. If either Bear State or
the Bank fails to promptly pay Arvest the amounts due under this _Section_ _9_
_.2_ within the time period specified herein, Bear State and the Bank shall
pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by
Arvest in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit,

extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party hereto and may waive (a) any inaccuracies of the other party
in the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or any
document delivered pursuant hereto, (b) compliance with any of the covenants,
undertakings or agreements of the other party or, to the extent permitted by
Law, satisfaction of any of the conditions precedent to its obligations
contained herein, or (c) the performance by the other party of any of its

supplemented at any time prior to the Effective Time by a mutual agreement in
writing executed by all of the parties hereto with respect to any of the terms
contained herein; provided, however, that the aggregate Merger Consideration
to be received by the shareholders of Bear State pursuant to this Agreement
shall not be decreased, or the income tax treatment negatively altered, by any

Agreement to any other Person without the prior written consent of the other
party or parties. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to

2. _Non-Competition_. From and after the date of this Agreement and ending on the [first/second] anniversary of the date hereof (the " _Non-Competition Period_ "), the Key Individual (either personally or by or through his agent) shall not, directly or indirectly, with or without compensation, engage in, be employed by or have any interest in (whether as a shareholder, director, officer, employee, subcontractor, partner, consultant, proprietor, agent or otherwise) any federally insured depository institution or an affiliate of such insured institution, having an office located, or any employees principally doing business, in Garland, Boone, Pulaski, Baxter, or Craighead Counties in Arkansas; or Greene County in Missouri (a " _Prohibited Business_ "); _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not (a) prevent or otherwise restrict the Key Individual from owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or less of the outstanding securities of any Prohibited Business, (b) require the Key Individual to divest his ownership in any Prohibited Business to the extent that such ownership exists as of the date of this Agreement and is disclosed in writing to Arvest prior to the date hereof.

SHAREHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT

 



 

_______________, 2017

 



 

Arvest Bank

____________________

 



 

Gentlemen:

 



 

The undersigned shareholder of Bear State Financial, Inc., an Arkansas
corporation (" _Bear State_ "), understands that Arvest Bank, an Arkansas
banking corporation (" _Arvest_ "), together with its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Arvest Acquisition Sub, Inc., an Arkansas corporation (" _Acquisition_ "), is
concurrently herewith entering into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
(the " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") with Bear State and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Bear State Bank, an Arkansas banking corporation (the " _Bank_ ").
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Agreement, Acquisition
will merge with and into Bear State (the " _Merger_ "), and the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of Bear State (the " _Bear State_ ___Common
Stock_ ") will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration as described in the Acquisition Agreement.

 



 

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective
meanings given to them in the Acquisition Agreement. The obligations of the
undersigned pursuant to this Shareholder Voting Agreement (the " _Agreement_
") shall terminate upon the earlier of (a) consummation of the Merger, or (b)
the termination of the Acquisition Agreement unless the Acquisition Agreement
is terminated by Arvest in accordance with Section 9.1(b) of the Acquisition
Agreement.

 



 

1. In order to induce Arvest and Acquisition to enter into the Acquisition Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the undersigned hereby represents, warrants and agrees that at the meeting of Bear State's shareholders contemplated by _Section 7.2_ of the Acquisition Agreement and any adjournment thereof, the undersigned will, in person or by proxy, vote or cause to be voted in favor of the Acquisition Agreement and the Merger all of the shares of Bear State Common Stock beneficially owned or controlled by the undersigned individually (including any shares of Bear State Common Stock owned by entities controlled by the undersigned) and, to the extent of the undersigned's proportionate voting interests, shares of Bear State Common Stock jointly owned with other persons, as well as (to the extent of the undersigned's proportionate voting interest) any other shares of Bear State Common Stock over which the undersigned may hereafter acquire beneficial ownership or control (collectively, the " _Shares_ "). The undersigned further agrees that he, she, or it will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any other shares of Bear State Common Stock over which he, she, or it has or shares voting power to be voted in favor of the Acquisition Agreement and the Merger.

 



 



 

 

 _Exhibit D_ to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization

   



 

2. The undersigned represents and warrants that he, she, or it has or shares the beneficial ownership or voting control of the number of shares of Bear State Common Stock set forth opposite his, her, or its name on _Schedule A_ hereto (which schedule includes shares of Bear State Common Stock held by entities controlled by the undersigned). The undersigned further represents, warrants and agrees that until the earlier of (a) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, or (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the undersigned will not, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(a) vote any of the Shares, or cause or permit any of the Shares to be
voted, in favor of (i) any other merger, consolidation, plan of liquidation,
sale of assets, reclassification or other transaction involving Bear State
that would have the effect of any Person, other than Arvest or an affiliate of
Arvest, acquiring Control (as defined below) over Bear State or any
substantial portion of the assets of Bear State; (ii) any acquisition or
purchase from Bear State or the Bank by any Person or "group" (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, the " _Exchange Act_ "))
of more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Bear
State or the Bank or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting
securities of Bear State or the Bank, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving Bear State or the Bank pursuant
to which the shareholders of Bear State or the Bank immediately preceding such
transaction hold less than 85% of the equity interests in the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction; (iii) any sale, lease (other than in the
ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the
ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of more than 15% of
the assets of Bear State or the Bank; or (iv) any liquidation or dissolution
of Bear State or the Bank; or

 



 

(b) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares, or
cause or permit any of the Shares to be sold, assigned, transferred or
otherwise disposed of, whether such shares of Bear State Common Stock are
owned of record or beneficially by the undersigned on the date hereof
(including shares held by entities controlled by the undersigned) or are
subsequently acquired, except (i) for transfers by will or by operation of law
(in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee); (ii) for gifts by
the undersigned, subject to the donee expressly assuming the obligations of
the undersigned arising under this Agreement; (iii) for sales, assignments,
transfers or other dispositions necessitated by hardship, with the prior
written consent of Arvest (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld),
provided that such transferee agrees to be bound by the terms hereof; or (iv)
as Arvest may otherwise agree in writing.

 



 

As used herein, the term " _Control_ " means (A) the ability to direct the
voting of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a Person having
ordinary voting power in the election of directors or in the election of any
other body having similar functions, or (B) the ability to direct the
management and policies of a Person, whether through ownership of securities,
through any contract, arrangement or understanding or otherwise.

 



 



 

 

 _Exhibit D_ to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization

   



 

3. The undersigned represents that (a) he, she, or it has the complete and unrestricted power and the unqualified right to enter into and perform the terms of this Agreement and that this Agreement does not conflict with the terms of any other agreement, understanding or document to which he, she, or it is a party; (b) this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement with respect to the undersigned, enforceable against the undersigned in accordance with its terms; and (c) he, she, or it has either sole and unrestricted voting power with respect to the Shares or such voting power is shared with another person entering into an agreement substantially identical to this Agreement. 

 



 

4. It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

5. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the undersigned in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Arvest shall be entitled to seek such an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the undersigned and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which Arvest is entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

6. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement. A facsimile or other electronic transmission of a signed counterpart of this Agreement shall be sufficient to bind the party or parties whose signature(s) appear thereon.

 



 

7. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arkansas applicable to agreements made and entirely to be performed within such jurisdiction except to the extent federal law may be applicable. If any provision hereof is deemed unenforceable by a court of law the enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected.

 



 

8. It is a condition to the effectiveness of this Agreement that the Acquisition Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by the parties thereto.

 



 

Very truly yours,
