SECTION 2.3. _Closing Date Balance Sheet; Payments on the Settlement Date_.

  



  

(a) (i) Not later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date or such other
time as is mutually agreed in writing by the Parties, Buyer shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and deliver to Sellers:

  



  

(A) a combined balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the last
calendar day of the month immediately preceding the Closing Date (such last
calendar day, the **" _Final Adjustment Date_ "**) which shall be prepared
using

  



        
   

  



  

the accounting principles, procedures, policies and methods used by Sellers
in preparing the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet (the **" _Proposed
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "**) and which shall reflect the Adjusted
Book Value as of the Final Adjustment Date; the Proposed Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Annex A hereto (the **" _Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value_ "**); and

  



  

(B) an officers certificate of Buyer (the **" _Proposed Final Adjusted Book
Value Certificate_ "**) setting forth the calculations used in
determining the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value in at least the same level
of detail as the calculations and footnotes set forth in Annex B hereto.

  



  

(ii) Upon the delivery of the Proposed Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value Certificate prepared in accordance
with Section 2.3(a)(i), Buyer shall (A) provide to Sellers and their
representatives copies of such work papers, books and records and other
documents relating to its and its accountants preparation of such documents
and the calculation of the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value and (B)
cooperate in good faith with, and make its and its Affiliates employees and
facilities reasonably available to, Sellers and their representatives for the
purpose of providing such other information as Sellers may reasonably request
concerning the Proposed Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Proposed
Final Adjusted Book Value. The combined balance sheet of the
Acquired Companies and Adjusted Book Value as finally agreed or determined in
accordance with Section 2.3(b) are hereinafter referred to as the **" _Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "** and the **" _Final Adjusted Book Value_**,
**"** respectively.

  



  

(b) Within sixty (60) days after its receipt of the Proposed Final Closing
Date Balance Sheet or such other time as is mutually agreed in writing by the
Parties (the **" _Notice Period_ "**), Sellers shall deliver in writing to
Buyer either (i) their agreement as to the calculation of the Proposed Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value or (ii)
their dispute thereof (if any), specifying in reasonable detail the nature of
their dispute (such items in dispute, the **" _Disputed Items_"** and such
notice of the Disputed Items, the **" _Dispute Notice_ "**).  If Sellers
fail to deliver to Buyer a Dispute Notice within the Notice Period, the
Proposed Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Adjusted
Book Value shall be final and binding on the Parties and shall constitute the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final Adjusted Book Value,
respectively. If Sellers deliver to Buyer a Dispute Notice prior to the
expiration of the Notice Period, each Party shall cooperate and shall cause
its representatives to cooperate with the other Parties and their
representatives in good faith to seek to promptly resolve the Disputed Items.
Any Disputed Items that are agreed to in writing by the Parties within thirty
(30) days of receipt of the Dispute Notice by Buyer or such other time as is
mutually agreed in writing by the Parties (the **" _Dispute Period_ "**)
shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Sellers and become part of the
calculation of the Final Adjusted Book Value. If at the end of the Dispute
Period, the Parties have failed to reach agreement with respect to any
Disputed Items, such Disputed Items shall be promptly submitted to Ernst and
Young LLP or if such accounting firm is not available, to an independent
certified public accounting firm of national standing and reputation jointly
selected and retained by Buyer and Sellers that is not an independent auditor
for either Buyer or Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer and
Sellers are unable to select such other accounting firm within twenty (20)
days after the expiration of the

  



        
   

  



  

Dispute Period, either Buyer or Sellers may request the American
Arbitration Association to appoint, within twenty (20) Business Days from the
date of such request, an independent accounting firm meeting the requirements
set forth above and with significant relevant experience.  The accounting
firm so selected at the end of the Dispute Period shall be referred to herein
as the **" _Accountant_**. **"** The Accountant may consider only those
Disputed Items which Buyer and Sellers have been unable to resolve within the
Dispute Period, and must resolve such Disputed Items in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
determination of the Accountant will neither be more favorable to Buyer than
reflected in the Proposed Final Closing Date Balance Sheet or the
Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value Certificate nor more favorable to Sellers
than reflected in the Sellers Dispute Notice (excluding the allocation of
expenses incurred in connection with the resolution of the Disputed Items).
The Accountant shall deliver to Buyer and Sellers, as promptly as practicable
and in any event within forty-five (45) days after its appointment, a written
report setting forth the resolution of each Disputed Item and the resulting
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final Adjusted Book Value determined
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The conclusions in
such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Sellers and become part
of the calculation of the Final Adjusted Book Value.  The forty-five (45)
day period for delivering the written report may be extended (x) by the
mutual written consent of the Parties or (y) by the Accountant for up to
thirty (30) days for good cause shown. Each of Buyer and Sellers shall bear
all of the fees and costs incurred by it in connection with the resolution of
the Disputed Items, except that all fees and expenses relating to the
foregoing work by the Accountant shall be borne by Buyer and Sellers, as the
case may be, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the Final Adjusted
Book Value and the remainder of such expenses shall be borne by the other
Party, which proportionate allocation will also be determined by the
Accountant and be included in the Accountants written report.

  



  

(c) During the Dispute Period and, if applicable, the time in which the
Accountant is reviewing the Disputed Items, each Party shall make available
(i) to the other Party and its representatives its accountants work papers,
schedules and other supporting data as may be reasonably requested by such
Party to enable such Party to verify the amounts set forth on the Proposed
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value
Certificate, and (ii) to the Accountant (if applicable) such work papers,
schedules and other supporting data as the Accountant may reasonably request
to resolve the Disputed Items submitted to it.

  



  

(d) If the Preliminary Adjusted Book Value exceeds the Final Adjusted Book
Value, Sellers shall pay to Buyer or, if the Final Adjusted Book Value
exceeds the Preliminary Adjusted Book Value, Buyer shall pay to Sellers, an
amount in United States dollars equal to the absolute value of the difference
between the Preliminary Adjusted Book Value and the Final Adjusted Book Value
(the **" _Final Adjustment Payment_ "**). The Final Adjustment Payment shall
be due and payable on the second Business Day after Buyer and Sellers agree
to the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final Adjusted Book Value or
Buyer and Sellers receive notice of any final determination of the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final Adjusted Book Value, in each case as
agreed or determined in accordance with Section 2.3(b) (the **" _Settlement
Date_ "**).

  



        
   

  



  

(e) The Final Adjustment Payment (plus interest on such amount from (and
including) the Closing Date up to (but excluding) the Settlement Date at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate as of the Closing Date,
calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days
elapsed) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts of the Party entitled to receive such payment, which
account or accounts shall be designated by Buyer to Sellers or by Sellers to
Buyer, as the case may be, not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Settlement Date.

  



  

SECTION 2.4. _Allocation Principles_. Any payments or reimbursements to
Sellers by Buyer or its Affiliates under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the Purchase Price, the Final Adjustment Payment and
indemnification payments pursuant to Article VIII and Article IX) shall be
allocated between Sellers and further allocated to the Acquired Company
Shares and among the Acquired Company Subsidiaries in accordance with the
principles set forth in Exhibit A hereto **.**

  



  

SECTION 2.5. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to Section 10.1 and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of
the conditions set forth in Article VI, the closing of the purchase and sale
of the Acquired Company Shares (the **" _Closing_ "**) shall take place: (i)

conditions which by their terms can only be satisfied at the Closing) shall

_Scheduled Closing Date_ "**), _provided_ , that Buyer may elect,
pursuant to Section 2.10, to delay the Closing to the first Business Day of
the next month after the Scheduled Closing Date (the **" _Delayed Closing

the obligations of Sellers to pay Buyer under this Section 2.9 with respect

_however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to: (1) cause any Insurance
Company to make or pay any distribution under this Section 2.9 to the extent
that, after giving effect to such distribution, such Insurance Companys RBC
Ratio would be lower than 450% immediately following the payment of such
distribution; (2) commence any lawsuit against applicable Insurance

Closing Date as the Elected Date, Buyer shall pay Sellers, pursuant to
Section 2.2(e), an amount equal to the product of (A) the Purchase Price as
of such Scheduled Closing Date (giving effect to Pre-Closing Distributions as
of such Scheduled Closing Date) times (B) the product of 0.06 times a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Delayed Closing
Period and the denominator of which is 360.

  



  

(b) If Buyer has not received all of the Form A Approvals by the date that is
150 days after the date hereof, Buyer may, upon written notice to Sellers,
elect to (i) continue to pursue approval of the financing plan set forth in
its existing Form A applications or other requests for approval of the
acquisition of control of a domestic insurer ("Form A Applications") or (ii)
file, not later than the next Business Day after such 150th day, with the
applicable Insurance Regulators, amendments of the Form A Applications which
shall request approval for financing the transactions contemplated hereby
through both (A) borrowings under the Bridge Facility, or any replacement
bridge facility, and (B) any other financing plan (including bank debt and
public and private offerings of debt, equity and hybrid securities) that
Buyer, in consultation with Sellers, reasonably believes will satisfy the
requirements of the Insurance Regulators in connection with their review of
the Form A Applications, in each case in sufficient amounts to enable Buyer
to pay the Purchase Price and consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

(c) If Buyer elects not to file amendments of the Form A Applications as
provided in Section 2.10(b)(i), Buyer shall pay interest on the June 30
Purchase Price at a rate of 6.00% per annum calculated on the basis of a year
of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed beginning from (and
including) the date that is 150 days after the date hereof to the earlier to
occur of the Closing Date and the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.1. Buyer shall pay such interest to Sellers by wire transfer to
an account designated by Sellers on the first day of each month during the
Delayed Closing Period, except the last payment shall be made on the earlier
to occur of the Closing Date and the first day of the month following such
termination.

  



  

(d) If Buyer has timely filed the amendments of the Form A Applications as
provided in Section 2.10(b)(ii), and has not received all of the Form A
Approvals by the date that is 210 days after the date hereof, Buyer shall pay
interest on the August 31 Purchase Price at a rate of 6.00% per annum
calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days
elapsed beginning from (and including) the date that is 210 days after the
date hereof to the earlier to occur of the Closing Date and the date this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1. Buyer shall pay
such interest to Sellers by wire transfer to an account designated by Sellers
on the first day of each month during the Delayed Closing Period, except the
last payment shall be made on the earlier to occur of the Closing Date and
the first day of the month following such termination.

  



        
   

  



  

(e) If Buyer has timely filed the amendments of the Form A Applications as
provided in Section 2.10(b)(ii), and thereafter all the conditions set forth
in Article VI (other than those conditions which by their terms cannot be
satisfied at the Closing) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance
with this Agreement prior to the date that is 210 days after the date hereof,
Buyer may, upon written notice to Sellers prior to the Scheduled Closing
Date, elect to delay the Closing until the Delayed Closing Date. In the
event that Buyer makes such election, (i) the conditions set forth in Section
6.2(a) and Section 6.2(d) shall be deemed satisfied on the Delayed Closing
Date if they were satisfied on the Scheduled Closing Date and (ii) not
later than five (5) Business Days before the Delayed Closing Date, Sellers
shall notify Buyer in writing of their election to have the Purchase Price
determined as of the Scheduled Closing Date or the Delayed Closing Date. If
Sellers elect the Scheduled Closing Date as the Elected Date, Buyer shall pay
Sellers, pursuant to Section 2.2(e), an amount equal to the product of (A)
the Purchase Price as of such Elected Date (giving effect to Pre-Closing
Distributions as of such Elected Date) times (B) the product of 0.06 times a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Delayed Closing
Period and the denominator of which is 360.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Buyer
elects to delay the Closing until the Delayed Closing Date and the Elected
Date referred to in subsections (a) and (e) is the Scheduled Closing Date and
not the Delayed Closing Date: (i) the calculations set forth in Section
2.2(a), (b), (c) and (d) shall be made as if such Scheduled Closing Date
were the Closing Date; (ii) the Final Adjustment Date referred to in Section
2.3 shall mean the last calendar day of the month immediately preceding
such Scheduled Closing Date and the Proposed Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet, the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value, the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet, the Final Adjusted Book Value and the Final Adjustment Payment shall
be determined as of such Final Adjustment Date; (iii) the Closing Date
referred to in the definition of the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet
shall mean the last calendar day of the month that is three (3) months
immediately prior to the month in which such Scheduled Closing Date falls;
and (iv) the Closing Date referred to in Section 4.17(d) shall mean the
Scheduled Closing Date.

  



  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 2.10 shall not constitute liquidated damages and shall be in addition
to any other legal or equitable remedies available to Sellers, and any such
payments shall not relieve Buyer of any liabilities or obligations resulting
from or arising in connection with any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement.

Effect, neither any Acquired Company nor Acquired Company Subsidiary that is
a party thereto nor, to the Knowledge of Sellers, any other party, is in
violation or default of any term of any such Applicable Contract and no
condition or event exists which with the giving of notice or

Applicable Contract by any Acquired Company or Acquired Company Subsidiary,
as the case may be, or any other party thereto or permit the termination,

in all material respects been paid (or provision for payment thereof has been
made) or calculated, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms

  



        
   

  



  

of such policies or contracts under which they arose and such payments were
not materially delinquent and were paid (or will be paid) without material

(vii) Each annuity contract issued or sold by an Insurance Company on or

thereof expected to qualify under Section 72 of the Code (or any relevant
Governmental Entitys interpretation thereof) satisfies and has satisfied the
requirements of Section 72 of the Code (or any relevant Governmental Entitys
interpretation thereof) since such annuity was issued. Each insurance policy
issued or sold before the Closing by an Insurance Company qualified at
issuance, and at all times since, as a life insurance contract under the Code
(or any relevant Governmental Entitys interpretation thereof), including
under Sections 101(f) and 7702 of the Code (or any relevant Governmental
Entitys interpretation thereof), if applicable to such policy. The tax
treatment under the Code (or any relevant Governmental Entitys
interpretation thereof) of all insurance policies or annuity contracts issued
or sold by each Insurance Company on or before the Closing Date is and at all
times has been in all material respects the same or more favorable to the
purchaser, policyholder or intended beneficiaries thereof as the tax
treatment under the Code (or any relevant Governmental Entitys
interpretation thereof) for which such policies or contracts purported to
qualify at the time of their issuance or purchase, except for changes
resulting from changes to the Code (or any relevant Governmental Entitys
interpretation thereof) which do not affect such policies or contracts due to
the effective date thereof.  Each Insurance Company has complied in all
material respects with all relevant requirements of the Code (or any relevant
Governmental Entitys interpretation thereof) and applicable state tax Laws
relating to the insurance and annuity policies and contracts it issued or
sold, including, without limitation, withholding, reporting and disclosure
requirements. Each life insurance policy which is a modified endowment
contract under Section 7702A of the Code (or any relevant Governmental
Entitys interpretation thereof) (a " ** _MEC_** ") has been marketed as such
at all relevant times or the policyholders otherwise have consented to such
MEC status.

Section 3.1(n)), all reports, statements, documents, registrations, filings
or submissions required to be filed by any Acquired Company or Acquired
Company Subsidiary with any Governmental Entity (the " ** _Other Reports_**
") have been filed, except where the failure to make such filings would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
set forth in Section 3.1(n) of the Sellers Disclosure Letter, all the Other

or as amended or supplemented, and no deficiencies have been asserted in
writing by any such Governmental Entity with respect to any Other Report that

possess, or have licenses to use, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(p)(i)

call or discussion.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) Without limiting any other provision in this Section 4.4, Buyer shall
use its best efforts to resolve, and to cause any Financing Counterparties to
resolve, such objections, if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Entity
with respect to the Contemplated Transactions or the Financing Arrangements.
It is understood that the obligation of Buyer under this Section 4.4 to use
its best efforts to obtain any approval or consent from a Governmental Entity
shall not require Buyer or its Affiliates to take any actions or to agree to
any conditions, restrictions or limitations that would, or would reasonably
be expected to, have a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
results of operations or business of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

  



  

(e) (i) To the extent that the rights of any Acquired Company or Acquired
Company Subsidiary under any license or other contract (including services,
agreements, software licenses and hardware leases) may not be transferred or
made available to Buyer or, after the Closing, to the Acquired Companies and
the Acquired Company Subsidiaries (pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement or otherwise) without obtaining the consent of a third party,
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall equally share
the costs (including any payments related to consents for the transfer of any
license or other similar fees and expenses, but excluding Kill Fees)
associated with obtaining the consents from such third party to obtain such
rights or replacement of such rights. Any communication by Buyer with third
parties in connection with obtaining such consents shall be with
Sellers participation, cooperation and approval.  With respect to those
consents which have not been obtained by the Closing Date, (A) this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to transfer or make available such rights
if an attempted transfer would constitute a breach of such license or other
contract or be unlawful and (B) other than as set forth in the Transition
Services Agreement, Sellers shall not be obligated to assist Buyer in
negotiating to obtain such rights or a replacement license or other contract
(it being understood that Sellers or their Affiliates obligations with
respect to obtaining rights or replacement licenses or other contracts for
licenses, services agreements, hardware leases and other contracts used in
connection with Sellers performance under the Transition Services Agreement
that have not been obtained by the Closing Date shall be as set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement). Buyer shall be liable for any Kill
Fees incurred as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in connection with any contracts of the Acquired
Companies or Acquired Company Subsidiaries or any contracts between Sellers
or their Affiliates and a third party pursuant to which the Acquired
Companies or the Acquired Company Subsidiaries receive any benefit;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall be liable for any such Kill Fees
arising under any such contracts if Sellers (A) had Knowledge of such Kill
Fees as of the date hereof and (B) failed to make the contract providing for
such Kill Fees available to Buyer on or before the date hereof. Other than
as set forth in the preceding sentence, in no event shall Sellers be liable
for any Kill Fees in connection with the transactions and services
contemplated hereunder or under the Transition Services Agreement.

  



  

(ii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries to, take such actions as may
be necessary or otherwise reasonably requested by Sellers or their Affiliates
in connection with the transfer or assignment to Sellers or their Affiliates
of those licenses and other contracts set forth in Section 4.4(e)(ii) of the
Sellers Disclosure Letter that, although in the name of an Acquired Company
or Acquired Company Subsidiary, are used by Sellers or their Affiliates
(other than in connection with the provision of services under the Transition
Services Agreement) (A) for the

  



        
   

  



  

benefit of themselves, (B) for the benefit of any Acquired Company
or Acquired Company Subsidiary or (C) for the benefit of themselves and for
the benefit of an Acquired Company or Acquired Company Subsidiary.

  



  

SECTION 4.5. _Public Announcements_.  Sellers and Buyer shall not, and shall
not permit their respective Affiliates or representatives, without the prior
written approval of the other Parties, to issue any press releases or
otherwise make any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, except (a) as may
be required by applicable Law or (b) as required by any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange, and then (in the case of both (a) and
(b)) only after such Party has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the approval of the other Parties prior to issuing such press release or
making such public disclosure.

  



  

SECTION 4.6. _Use of Names_. (a) Prior to or at the Closing and effective
immediately prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cause the Acquired Companies
and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries to transfer any and all right, title or
interest, including all associated goodwill, which any of them may have in or
to the name, trademark and service mark "Chase" or "JPMorgan Chase" or any
name, trademark, service mark, acronym or logo based on or incorporating the
foregoing name, trademark or service mark or any portion of it which is
currently used by or on behalf of any of them (collectively, the " **
_Licensed Trademarks_** ") or which was previously used by or on behalf of
any of them to Sellers or Affiliates of Sellers as Sellers may direct. At the
Closing, Sellers, or an Affiliate of Sellers, and Buyer on behalf of the
Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries shall enter into the
License Agreement permitting the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries a royalty-free license to use the Licensed Trademarks.

  



  

(b) After the date hereof, Buyer shall select a new name for each Acquired
Company and Acquired Company Subsidiary that does not include a Licensed
Trademark or any confusingly similar name or mark. Upon or after the Closing,
Buyer shall or shall cause each Acquired Company and Acquired Company
Subsidiary: (i) to take all actions as shall be necessary to change its name
to the name selected by Buyer, including but not limited to amending each
Acquired Companys and Acquired Company Subsidiarys certificate of
incorporation (or equivalent organizational documents); (ii) to commence
filing the applicable documents relating thereto with the appropriate
Governmental Entities within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date and
to complete filing such documents with the appropriate Governmental Entities
within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date; and (iii) to
take all other actions as shall be necessary to cease all use of the Licensed
Trademarks (other than as provided in the License Agreement), including
changing all trademarks or service marks used by the Acquired Companies and
the Acquired Company Subsidiaries to marks that do not include any Licensed
Trademark or any confusingly similar name or mark. The term of the License
Agreement with respect to the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries shall be for uses as described in the License Agreement, but in
no event shall such term be longer than twelve (12) months from the Closing
Date. Any costs incurred by Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers in connection
with any work performed prior to the Closing shall, upon the Closing, be
treated under the Transition Services Agreement as Sellers Pass-Through
Expenses (as that term is defined therein) and such costs shall be reflected
on the first TSA Monthly Invoice (as that term is defined therein) from
Sellers thereunder.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 4.7. _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, (a)
Buyer shall afford, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries) to afford, to Sellers and
any Affiliates of Sellers, and their respective counsel and accountants and
other representatives, during normal business hours, reasonable access to
inspect, audit and take copies of the books and records of the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries with respect to the period
prior to the Closing Date and (b) Buyer shall cause, and shall cause its
Affiliates to cause, its employees to cooperate, to the fullest
extent practicable, with Sellers and their Affiliates, in each case with
respect to the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), to the extent that such access
may be reasonably required by Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers, including
the investigation, defense, prosecution, litigation and final disposition of
any claims (including indemnification claims by Sellers or their
Affiliates pursuant to the Ohio Casualty Agreement or the Zurich Agreement
and any matters with respect to which Sellers are providing indemnification
to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document) that might have been or might be made by or against Sellers or any
Affiliate of Sellers in connection with the business of the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall
include, without limitation, the execution of affidavits,
appearances, testimony and production of documents pursuant to federal and
state criminal and civil subpoenas, depositions, interrogatories and other
requests. Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, dispose of,
alter or destroy any such books and records until the later of (i) seven (7)
years after the Closing Date, (ii) sixty (60) days after giving written
notice to Sellers which notice shall permit Sellers, at their expense, to
examine, duplicate or repossess such books and records and (iii) the time
specified in the applicable Insurance Companys record retention guidelines
as in effect on the date hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section

confidentiality of any documents or information provided pursuant to this
Section 4.7 that are subject to an attorney-client or other legal privilege
or subject to an obligation of confidentiality or privacy.

  



  

SECTION 4.8. _Restructuring_.  Subject to obtaining the Permits necessary to
consummate the transactions set forth in this Section 4.8, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

  



  

(a) Sellers hereby covenant and agree that from the date hereof through the
Closing Date, Sellers shall use their best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, any and all actions and to do, or cause to be done, any and all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Requirements of Law or
otherwise to have the Top-Tier Insurance Companies distribute to Sellers an
aggregate amount of Pre-Closing Distributions equal to $400,000,000 (or such
lesser amount as (i) shall be specified in writing by Buyer at least thirty
(30) days prior to the Closing or (ii) is permitted to be paid under
applicable Requirements of Law); _provided_ , _however_ , in no event (i)
shall any Insurance Company make any distributions under this Section 4.8(a)
to the extent that, after giving effect to such distributions, such Insurance
Companys RBC Ratio would be less than 450% or (ii) shall Sellers be required
to commence any lawsuit against applicable Insurance Regulators or inject any
capital into an Insurance Company or otherwise raise capital on its behalf.
Sellers shall consult with Buyer with respect to the selection of the assets
of the Insurance Companies to be sold in order to provide funds to pay any
distributions under this Section 4.8(a). Sellers shall use their best
efforts to file, or cause the appropriate Acquired Company or
Acquired Company Subsidiary to file, with all applicable Governmental
Entities

  



        
   

  



  

requests for approval of such distributions, which requests shall include all
required exhibits. Sellers shall (i) provide to Buyer copies of all
applications or other material communications to applicable Insurance
Regulators in connection with approvals relating to such distributions a
reasonable time in advance of the filing or submission thereof, shall provide
Buyer with a reasonable opportunity prior to such filing or submission to
comment upon drafts of the materials to be filed or submitted and shall in
good faith consider comments timely received from Buyer with respect thereto
and (ii) keep Buyer apprised of the status of obtaining any such approvals.
Sellers shall, subject to applicable Requirements of Law, (A) consult with
Buyer prior to attending or participating in any substantive meeting,
substantive conference call or substantive discussion (excluding informal or
impromptu discussions) with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, submissions, investigation or inquiry concerning such distributions
and provide Buyer and its representatives the opportunity to attend and
participate in any substantive meetings, substantive conference calls or
substantive discussions with any Governmental Entity or other third party in
connection with such distributions, and (B) promptly furnish Buyer with
copies of all substantive correspondence and written communications (or a
reasonably detailed summary of any substantive oral communications) between
Sellers and their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity, on the other hand, concerning such distributions. If Buyer is
notified by Sellers of any meeting, conference call or discussion, Buyer
shall promptly advise Sellers as to whether it will attend or participate in
such meeting, conference call or discussion. Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, cooperate with Sellers in doing all things necessary to
cause such distributions to be paid or made to Sellers prior to or at the
Closing.

  



  

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries to, terminate or assign the
agreements set forth in Section 4.8(b) of the Sellers Disclosure Letter
between the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies
and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries), on the other hand.

  



  

(c) Prior to or at the Closing, Sellers shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries to settle all payable and receivable balances (including those
related to Taxes) between the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sellers and their Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries), on the other
hand; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that any such balance that
should have been settled prior to or at the Closing in accordance with this
Section 4.8(c) has not been so settled prior to or at the Closing, Sellers
shall settle any such unsettled balance promptly after Closing.

  



  

(d) Without limiting Section 4.6, prior to or at the Closing, Sellers shall
cause the ownership of Intellectual Property Rights owned by the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries but used by Sellers or their
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies or the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries) to be transferred to Sellers or their Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies or the Acquired Company Subsidiaries). For the
avoidance of doubt, any trademark that includes the words "Chase" or
"JPMorgan Chase" or the logos set forth in Section 4.8(d) of the Sellers
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed Intellectual Property Rights that shall be
transferred pursuant to this Section 4.8(d).

  



        
   

  



  

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Parent and
Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Parent
Contracts to be assigned to the applicable Acquired Companies or Acquired
Company Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Closing or reasonably promptly thereafter, Sellers shall
pay or cause to be paid (i) all amounts due to the Employees and the
Allocated Employees under the Insurance Company Incentive Plans and (ii) in
its sole discretion, such amounts to such Employees and Allocated Employees
as discretionary bonuses as it deems appropriate, in each case for periods
prior to the Closing.  Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cause the
Insurance Companies to (i) transfer to Sellers cash equal to any remaining
amounts accrued on the books and records of the Insurance Companies in
connection with obligations under the Insurance Company Incentive Plans and
their discretionary bonus pool as of the Closing Date and (ii) release the
reserves corresponding with such accruals. None of Sellers or
their Affiliates shall have any obligation to pay any amounts under, or have
any liability with respect to, the Insurance Company Incentive Plans or
the Insurance Companies discretionary bonuses for any periods after the
Closing.

  



  

(g) Prior to the Closing, CBD shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to assign to CLAC its rights and obligations under the Ohio Casualty
Agreement, including its indemnification rights thereunder. Sellers shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer to assist
CLAC in exercising such indemnification rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to incur any out-
of-pocket expenses or take any action that it believes would expose it to any
liability.

  



  

SECTION 4.9. _No Adverse Actions under the Zurich Agreement or the Ohio
Casualty Agreement_. (a)  From and after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies and the Acquired
Company Subsidiaries) not to, take or fail to take any actions that would
result in Sellers or their Affiliates being in violation, in breach of, or in
default under, any of the provisions of the Zurich Agreement or the Ohio
Casualty Agreement that survive the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including Section 5.22 of the Zurich Agreement). Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies and the Acquired
Company Subsidiaries) to, cooperate with Sellers in taking any actions
reasonably requested by Sellers and refraining from taking any actions that
would reasonably be expected to directly or indirectly delay or interfere
with Sellers or their Affiliates indemnification rights, claims or
recoveries under the Zurich Agreement or the Ohio Casualty Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be required to
take any action which Buyer reasonably concludes would subject it or any of
the Acquired Companies or the Acquired Company Subsidiaries to any material
liability, loss, cost, expense, risk or exposure to any third party.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, Sellers shall not, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, amend or modify the Ohio Casualty Agreement
or the Zurich Agreement if such amendment or modification is materially
adverse to Buyer, unless such amendment or modification is required by, or to
avoid any violation of, any Requirements of Law.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 4.10. _Non-Competition_. (a) For a period of two (2) years after
the Closing Date (the " ** _Non-Compete Period_** "), Parent and Sellers
shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates (Parent and Sellers, together
with such Affiliates, the " ** _Seller Entities_** ") not to, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, engage in the Restricted Business in a manner
that competes directly with the business of the Acquired Companies and the
Acquired Company Subsidiaries as conducted on the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.10(a), nothing in this
Agreement shall preclude, prohibit, restrict or otherwise limit any of the
Seller Entities from:

  



  

(i) owning, operating or engaging in any manner in (x) any business
activities that do not constitute part of the Restricted Business or (y) any
Financial Services Business;

  



  

(ii) owning, operating or engaging in any manner in any De Minimis Business;

  



  

(iii) offering, selling, marketing, distributing or providing, directly or
through any distribution system or similar channel, any life insurance or

to this Section 4.10;

  



  

(iv) insuring (whether by self-insurance, reinsurance, captive arrangements
or otherwise) the insurance risks of, and issuing bonds related to, the

respective employees;

  



  

(v) applying for and holding any insurance license, permit or other
authorization;

  



  

(vi) acquiring, merging or otherwise combining with, or being acquired by
any Person (whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions),
notwithstanding that such Person or any of its Affiliates, directly or
indirectly, is engaged in the Restricted Business (any such transaction or
series of related transactions, a " ** _Combination Transaction_** " and the
Person with which such Combination Transaction is effected, the " **
_Combining Person_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that during the Non-Compete
Period, the Seller Entities shall not enter into a Combination Transaction
with a Combining Person in which the assets under management relating to the
Combining Persons Restricted Business (excluding separate accounts and
segregated accounts) as of the closing date of the Combination Transaction
exceed 40% of the Combining Persons total consolidated assets (excluding
separate accounts and segregated accounts) as of such date as determined in
accordance with GAAP; and _provided_ , _further_ , that during the Non-
Compete Period, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit, restrict or
otherwise limit the Combining Person (or if the Combining Person is not the
survivor of such Combination Transaction, the surviving Person of
such Combination Transaction) or the Affiliates of such Person from
continuing to own, operate or engage in such Restricted Business;

  



        
   

  



  

(vii) acquiring, directly or indirectly, any voting stock, capital stock or
other equity interests (including convertible securities) of any Person in
connection with any hedging or similar products; or

  



  

(viii) acquiring capital stock or other equity interests of any Person
engaged directly or indirectly in the Restricted Business, _provided_ , that
such acquisition is and remains during the Non-Compete Period an acquisition
solely for investment purposes.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Section 4.10, the terms below shall have the
following respective meanings:

  



  

" ** _De Minimis Business_** " means any business activities conducted by the
Seller Entities that would otherwise be deemed to relate primarily to the
Restricted Business in which (A) the aggregate net premiums written by the
Seller Entities derived from term life insurance and universal life insurance
for the immediately preceding fiscal year, as determined in accordance with
SAP, do not exceed $15 million or (B) the aggregate net deposits received by
the Seller Entities derived from fixed annuity, variable annuity products and
single premium whole life insurance products for the immediately preceding
year, as determined in accordance with SAP, do not exceed $150 million.

  

 ** **

  

" ** _Financial Services Business_** " means: (A) lending, financing and
other retail and corporate banking activities; (B) proprietary and third
party portfolio, asset management, private banking, merchant banking, private

Business).

  



  

" ** _Restricted Business_** " means the business of issuing term life
insurance, universal life insurance and single premium whole life insurance
and fixed annuity and variable annuity products in the United States as
conducted by the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries on
the Closing Date but only to the extent that the issuance of such products
(A) requires the company issuing such products to obtain and maintain an
insurance company license and (B) is regulated as an insurance business by
any Governmental Entity in the place where such products are issued.

  



  

(d) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, Parent and
Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Subsidiaries not to, sponsor or
actively participate in (or make any records available to third parties for
the purpose of sponsoring or actively engaging in) an organized solicitation
specifically directed at the Protective Class for the purpose of causing the
members of the Protective Class to exchange or replace single premium whole
life insurance policies, fixed annuities or variable annuities issued by the
Insurance Companies and in-force on the Closing Date (" ** _Protective
Products_** ") with other whole life insurance policies, fixed annuities or
variable annuities; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this Section 4.10(d) shall
not apply at any time (i) the claims-paying ability of Protective Life
Insurance Company is rated "B++" or lower by A.M. Best Company (" ** _Best_**
") (or the equivalent rating in the event that Best changes its
rating designations), or (ii) with respect to any fixed annuities or single
premium whole life products, in

  



        
   

  



  

the event that the applicable Insurance Company sets renewal crediting rates
thereon at levels that are materially below then-current market levels for
comparable in-force policies. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section
4.10(d) does not restrict any of Parent or Sellers or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, employees or agents from: (A) (i) responding to inquiries from
members of the Protective Class, (ii) engaging in ad hoc solicitations of
individual members of the Protective Class in the ordinary course of

on the criterion that such individuals own Protective Products.

  



  

SECTION 4.11. _Nonsolicitation_. For a period of two (2) years after the

_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing provision shall not prohibit the
Seller Entities from offering employment to or employing persons: (a) who
respond to a general solicitation or advertisement that is not specifically
directed to the Transferred Employees (and nothing shall prohibit the making
of any such solicitation or advertisement); (b) who are referred to the
Seller Entities by search firms, employment agencies or other similar
entities, _provided_ , that such entities have not been specifically
instructed by the Seller Entities to solicit the Transferred Employees; (c)
whose employment has been terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates; or
(d) who are Transferred Employees and contact any Seller Entity on their own
initiative without solicitation.

  



  

SECTION 4.12. _Advisory Contract Consents_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, Sellers shall cause the Acquired Company
Investment Advisers to inform their noninvestment company advisory clients of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall, in compliance with
the Investment Advisers Act and any other applicable Law, request such
clients consent as may be necessary to effect the assignment of their
Investment Advisory Related Agreements.  Buyer agrees that Sellers may
satisfy this obligation, insofar as it relates to noninvestment company
advisory clients (other than collective investment arrangements managed by an
Acquired Company Investment Adviser as to which the governing instruments or
applicable Law require any different or supplemental procedure, in which case
such different or supplemental procedures must be followed), by providing
each such client with the notice contemplated by the first sentence of this
Section 4.12 and obtaining either a new investment advisory contract with
such client effective at the Closing or such clients consent in the form of
an actual written consent or in the form of an implied consent and complying
with any other requirements including, but not limited to, to the extent
applicable, the disclosure requirements of Rule 204-3 under the Investment
Advisers Act. It is understood that such implied consent may be obtained by
requesting written consent as aforesaid and informing in writing such client
at least sixty (60) days prior to the Closing of: (a) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and Sellers intention to complete such
transactions so as to result in a statutory assignment of such Investment
Advisory Related Agreements; (b) Sellers (or the applicable Acquired Company
Investment Advisers) intention to continue the advisory services, under the
existing Investment Advisory Related Agreement with such client after the
Closing if such client does not terminate such Investment Advisory Related
Agreement prior to

  



        
   

  



  

the Closing; and (c) the fact that if such client continues to accept such
advisory services without termination the consent of such client will
be implied.

  



  

SECTION 4.13. _BOIC_. To the extent that all required consents, approvals and
authorizations of the applicable Governmental Entities for the execution of
the BOIC Amendments are obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
shall cause CILAC, CILC and BOIC to enter into the BOIC Amendments on the
Closing Date.

  



  

SECTION 4.14. _Pre-Closing Investment Management_.  Sellers shall cause the
investment portfolios of the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries to be managed in accordance with the investment guidelines
previously made available to Buyer (the " ** _Investment Guidelines_** ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Acquired Company and the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries shall not make any new investments after the date hereof in (a)
securities that are not investment grade at the time of purchase, (b)
securities issued by any Person not organized in the United States or (c)
securities (other than pursuant to commitments made prior to the date hereof
to be consummated after the date hereof) issued in a private placement
transaction, unless such securities were offered by a Person organized in the
United States in an offering under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of at
least $300,000,000 of securities. From the date hereof through the Closing
Date, Sellers shall notify Buyer in advance of any proposed changes in the
Investment Guidelines, and shall provide Buyer an opportunity to meet and
consult with Sellers on any such proposed changes so that Buyer and
Sellers may cooperate in the making of any proposed changes in the
Investment Guidelines and in the implementation of any such changes.

  



  

SECTION 4.15. _Replacement of Operations Insurance Policies_.  Buyer
acknowledges that as of the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies and the
Acquired Company Subsidiaries will cease to be entitled to the benefit of the
Operations Insurance Policies maintained by Sellers or an Affiliate
of Sellers for the benefit of the business or properties of the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

SECTION 4.16. _Buyer Financing_. (a) Buyer shall keep Sellers informed on a
prompt basis with respect to all material activity concerning the status of
the Goldman Coinsurance Arrangement and the Wilton Coinsurance Arrangement,
and shall give Sellers prompt written notice of any material change from the
most recent drafts of the coinsurance agreements with respect to such
arrangements made available to Sellers prior to the date hereof, and of any
material adverse change with respect to such arrangements. Without limiting
the foregoing, Buyer shall immediately notify Sellers in writing if at any
time any party to either the Goldman Coinsurance Arrangement or the Wilton
Coinsurance Arrangement, notifies Buyer that such party has determined not to
provide reinsurance in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) Sellers shall deliver to Buyer: (i) as promptly as practicable, but not

by GAAP; and (iv) as promptly as practicable, such other GAAP financial
statements (for periods ending prior to December 31, 2005) of the Acquired
Companies requested in writing by Buyer that are required by Regulation S-X
to be included in a registration statement or prospectus relating to a

end of such Quarterly Period and the related combined statements of

cooperate fully with each other, and cause their independent auditors to so
cooperate, to provide the necessary information required or do any other
actions required to prepare the documentation for any public offering or
required SEC filing, and if necessary, to consummate any such public
offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall promptly reimburse
Sellers in cash for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Sellers
in connection with preparing the financial statements described in Section
4.16(b) or other documentation for any such public offering or required SEC
filing.

  



  

SECTION 4.17. _ISTP Projects_. (a) As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, Buyer shall provide Sellers with a written list of ISTP Projects it
wishes the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries to
terminate prior to the Closing and a reasonable description of the rationale
therefor. As soon as practicable after Sellers receive Buyers written list
and description, Buyer and Sellers shall jointly agree to the final list of
ISTP Projects to be eliminated or modified, the timetable for such
eliminations or modifications and a revised information technology plan
of the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries to take
into account such eliminations and modifications.  Sellers shall consult
with Buyer and keep Buyer fully apprised of the progress in implementing the
ISTP Projects, including any proposed changes to the timetable or estimated
costs previously agreed to by the Parties.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver,
promptly after the end of each calendar quarter, a financial report
substantially in the form of the finance report made available to Buyer
pursuant to Section 3.1(x) setting forth the historical ISTP Costs incurred
as of the end of such quarter and a forecast of the remaining ISTP Costs
required to complete the ISTP Projects; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not require Sellers or any of their Affiliates to prepare and
furnish any report or other information not otherwise prepared in the
ordinary course of the business consistent with past practices.

  



  

(c) If the ISTP Costs as of June 30, 2006 exceed $35,000,000, Buyer shall
pay Sellers such excess amount at the Closing as provided in Section 2.2(f).

  



  

(d) Buyer shall pay Sellers for any ISTP Costs incurred after June 30, 2006
up to and including the Closing Date.

  



  

(e) From the date hereof to the Closing Date, Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Acquired Companies and the

delaying or modifying the revised information technology plan agreed to by
the Parties pursuant to this Section 4.17.

  



  

SECTION 4.18. _Other Obligations of Sellers_.  Sellers shall, or cause their

through the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to collect all amounts due and payable
relating to the assets comprising the Non-Admitted Assets as of the Closing
Date (" ** _Closing Date Non-Admitted Assets_** ").

  



  

(b) Not later than thirty (30) days after each of the first and second
anniversaries of the Closing Date, or such other date as is mutually agreed
by the Parties, Buyer

  



        
   

  



  

shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a schedule setting forth in reasonable
detail the aggregate amounts collected and agent debit balance earned with

Buyer during such period in connection with collecting amounts due and
payable relating to such assets. Buyer shall prepare such schedules in good
faith and provide to Sellers and their representatives such information as
Sellers may reasonably request relating to the Closing Date Non-Admitted
Assets and such schedules. If there is any dispute that arises
concerning any of the amounts collected with respect to any of the Closing
Date Non-Admitted Assets or the schedules, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to promptly resolve any such disputes.

  



  

(c) Promptly after the Parties agree to the schedule relating to the
aggregate amounts collected and agent debit balance earned with respect to
the Closing Date Non-Admitted Assets from (and including) the Closing Date to
(and including) the second anniversary of the Closing Date (the " **
_Aggregate Collections_** "), if (i) the Aggregate Collections less the
documented reasonable out-of-pocket third party expenses incurred by Buyer in
connection with such collections exceed $6,400,000, Buyer shall pay Sellers
the amount of such excess by wire transfer to an account or accounts
designated by Sellers; or (ii) the Aggregate Collections are less than
the lesser of (x) $6,400,000 and (y) the Closing Date Non-Admitted Assets

by Buyer.

consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Acquired Companies and Acquired Company Subsidiaries at 2500

allocation consistent with the amounts set forth in the Project Indigo

SECTION 5.1. _Transferred Employees_. (a) At least thirty (30) days prior to
the Scheduled Closing Date (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall mean the
Scheduled Closing Date, without regard to any delay thereof pursuant to
Section 2.5), Buyer shall provide to Seller a list of the Employees that
Buyer does not wish to be employed by an Acquired

  



        
   

  



  

Company or an Acquired Company Subsidiary on the Closing Date (the " **
_Listed Employees_** "). None of the Listed Employees shall be employed by an
Acquired Company or an Acquired Company Subsidiary on the Closing Date. All
(i) Employees who are employees of an Acquired Company or an Acquired Company
Subsidiary as of the Closing Date (excluding, for purposes of clarity, all
Listed Employees) and (ii) any individuals who are Allocated Employees as of
the Closing Date who Buyer requests in writing to become employees of Buyer
or its Affiliates on the Closing Date shall be considered " **
_Transferred Employees_** " for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Buyer may, in its sole discretion, arrange for an unaffiliated third-
party administrator or similar entity (" ** _TPA Firm_** ") to offer to employ
some or all of the Transferred Employees, with employment to commence after
the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Any provision of this Article V to the contrary notwithstanding, (i)
each Transferred Employee shall be an "employee at will" of Buyer and its
Affiliates, unless specifically provided otherwise in a written agreement
between such Transferred Employee and Buyer, and (ii) each Employee who is
hired by a TPA Firm shall be an "employee at will" of such TPA Firm, unless
specifically provided otherwise in a written agreement between such
Transferred Employee and such TPA Firm.

  



  

SECTION 5.2. _Post-Closing Benefits_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Transferred
Employee, while employed by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any TPA Firm
with: (i) base pay (which shall mean annual base salary for salaried
employees and hourly wages for Employees paid on an hourly basis) at least
equal to the base pay provided to such Transferred Employee immediately prior
to the Closing Date; (ii) an opportunity to earn bonus and incentive
compensation, as applicable, that is comparable to the opportunity available
to employees of Buyer and its Affiliates with similar duties or
responsibilities (other than the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries); (iii) employee benefits (other than any retiree life or
retiree health benefits provided to any former employees or any other person,
except as may be required under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 of
ERISA or any other applicable Law) that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to such employee benefits provided to employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates with similar duties or responsibilities (other than the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries); (iv) job duties and
responsibilities that are comparable to those such Transferred Employee held
immediately prior to the Closing Date (but taking into account such change as
may be appropriate in connection with the transition of business to
the systems and processes of Buyer and its Affiliates, _provided_ , that
such changes do not result in a substantial reduction of duties
or responsibilities); and (v) employment at the same facility at which
each Transferred Employee worked immediately prior to the Closing Date, or at
a facility that is within twenty-five (25) miles from such facility. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall create any rights
enforceable by third parties, including the Transferred Employees, it being
acknowledged that there are no third-party beneficiaries of this provision.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates and any TPA Firm that employs
any Transferred Employees to, credit Transferred Employees for their service
with Sellers, their Affiliates and their predecessors, to the same extent
recognized by Sellers or their Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing
Date, for all purposes under the employee benefit plans or

  



        
   

  



  

arrangements maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, without
limitation, any welfare plan, pension plan, vacation program or severance
program) in which any such Transferred Employees participate post-Closing,
except: (i) for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit retirement
plan(s) maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates; and (ii) to the extent such
credit would result in an unintended duplication of benefits or a violation
of Law.

  



  

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates and any TPA Firm that employs
any Transferred Employees to: (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any
welfare plans in which such Transferred Employees may be eligible to
participate on or after the Closing Date; and (ii) provide each Transferred
Employee with credit under any welfare plans in which any such Transferred
Employee is eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date for any co-
payments and deductibles credited under the corresponding Sellers welfare
plan towards satisfying applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
in the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

  



  

SECTION 5.3. _Termination and Severance_. (a) If (i) a Transferred
Employees employment is terminated by Buyer, an Affiliate of Buyer or a TPA
Firm as a result of job elimination during the twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date under circumstances that would entitle a Transferred
Employee to severance pay and benefits as set forth in Sellers severance
plan on the date hereof or (ii) Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer fails to
comply with Section 5.2(a) with respect to any Transferred Employee,
such Transferred Employee shall be entitled to receive the greater of:

  



  

(A) severance benefits from Buyer or its Affiliates equal to the severance
benefits that the Transferred Employee would have received under the JPMorgan
Chase Severance Pay Plan (as in effect on the date hereof and as provided for
in the "Summary Plan Description for the JPMorgan Chase Severance Pay Plan"
made available to Buyer as document number 13.07.03.01 on the Interlinks
website) (the " ** _Parent Severance Pay Plan_** "), had the Parent Severance
Pay Plan remained applicable to such Transferred Employee and taking into
account the Transferred Employees service in accordance with Section 5.2, as
well as the Transferred Employees service with the Buyer and its Affiliates
(but treating continued participation in Buyers medical, dental, health
care reimbursement account, supplemental term insurance and accidental death
and dismemberment insurance as equivalent to continued participation in
Sellers welfare plans); or

  



  

(B) the severance benefits to which the Transferred Employee is entitled
under Buyers or a Buyer Affiliates (as applicable) severance plan or
policy, taking into account the Transferred Employees service in accordance
with Section 5.2.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for any costs, liabilities or obligations
incurred by Sellers or any of their Affiliates under the Parent Severance Pay
Plan (including, without limitation, any costs of providing welfare or other
benefits during a Listed Employees

  



        
   

  



  

severance period), to the extent caused by, relating to, or arising out of
the transfer or termination of any Listed Employee in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer
shall reimburse Sellers for 50% of all compensation related costs and
expenses payable to the Listed Employees by Sellers or any of their
Affiliates (including the cost of benefits provided by Sellers or their
Affiliates under an Employee Benefit Plan), in each case as referenced in 29
U.S.C. § 2104 (" ** _WARN Costs_** "); _provided_ , _however_ that if the
WARN Costs exceed $4,000,000 in the aggregate, Buyer shall reimburse Sellers
for 100% of such excess. Buyers reimbursement payments pursuant to this
Section 5.3(b) shall be made no later than thirty (30) days after Sellers
deliver to Buyer an invoice of such costs, liabilities or obligations and
such payments shall be made by wire transfer to the account or accounts
designated by Sellers in Section 2.6. This Section 5.3(b) shall not limit
Buyers indemnification obligations for Losses pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii) except to the extent such indemnification would constitute a
duplication of obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall in no
event be responsible for reimbursement of any such WARN Costs to the extent
the WARN Costs result from Sellers failure to provide notices to affected
employees on or prior to the day after the Closing Date.

  



  

In no event shall this Agreement cause a Transferred Employee to be entitled
to severance benefits from Buyer or its Affiliates (including, as of the
Closing Date, the Acquired Companies) as a result of (i) an Employees
acceptance of employment with a TPA Firm on or after the Closing Date, or
(ii) a Transferred Employees termination of employment with Buyer and its
Affiliates in connection with the Transferred Employees commencement of
employment with a TPA Firm.

  



  

SECTION 5.4. _Welfare Plan Liability_.  Sellers shall retain responsibility
for and continue to pay, or cause to be paid, all medical, life insurance,
disability and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for Transferred
Employees with respect to claims incurred by such Transferred Employees or
their covered dependents prior to the Closing Date, in accordance with the
terms of the Employee Benefit Plans. Expenses and benefits with respect to
claims incurred by Transferred Employees or their covered dependents on or
after the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of Buyer and its
Affiliates in accordance with the applicable terms of the plans of Buyer and
its Affiliates. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim is deemed incurred
when the services that are the subject of the claim are performed; in the
case of life insurance, when the death occurs; in the case of long-term
disability benefits, when the disability begins; and in the case of
a hospital stay, when the employee or covered dependent first enters
the hospital.

  



  

SECTION 5.5. _Accrued Vacation_. With respect to any accrued but unused
vacation time for calendar year 2006 to which any Transferred Employee is
entitled under Sellers vacation policy immediately prior to the Closing Date
(the " ** _Vacation Policy_** "), Buyer shall allow, and shall cause its
Affiliates and any TPA Firm that employs any Transferred Employees to allow,
such Transferred Employees to use such accrued vacation in the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer, such
Affiliate or such TPA Firm deems it necessary to disallow such Transferred
Employee from taking such accrued vacation, Buyer and its Affiliates shall be
liable for and pay in cash to such Transferred Employee an amount equal to
such vacation time in accordance with the terms of the Vacation Policy on or
before December 31 of the year in which the Closing occurs; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Buyer shall be liable for and pay in cash an amount equal to
such accrued vacation time to

  



        
   

  



  

any Transferred Employee whose employment terminates for any
reason subsequent to the Closing Date and prior to December 31, 2006.

  



  

SECTION 5.6. _COBRA_. Sellers shall be responsible for all legally mandated
continuation of health care coverage for all Transferred Employees and any of
their covered dependents who experience a qualifying event on or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible for all legally mandated
continuation of health care coverage for all Transferred Employees and any of
their covered dependents who experience a qualifying event after the Closing
Date.

  



  

SECTION 5.7. _Qualified Plans_. To the extent permitted by Law, Buyer agrees
that Buyers 401(k) and Stock Ownership Plan will accept a direct cash to
cash rollover of the account of any Transferred Employee in the JPMorgan
Chase 401(k) Savings Plan or lump sum distribution from the JPMorgan Chase
Retirement Plan who elects to make such a direct rollover (excluding a direct
rollover, in kind, of any outstanding loan(s) of any such Transferred
Employee under the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan), except to the extent
that such rollover would, in the reasonable belief of Buyer, adversely affect
the tax qualified status of Buyers plan. To the extent necessary,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, amend its defined
contribution plan prior to the Closing in order to carry out the intent of
this Section 5.7.

  



  

SECTION 5.8. _Filings and Records_.  Sellers, Buyer, the Acquired Companies
and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries shall cooperate in (a) making all
filings required under the Code or ERISA and any applicable securities Laws
with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans that cover Employees, (b)
implementing all appropriate communications with participants, (c)
maintaining and transferring appropriate records and (d) taking all such
other actions as may be necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions
of this Article V. After the Closing, to the extent permitted by Law,
Sellers, Buyer, the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries
shall cooperate fully with one another in providing records regarding the
employment of, and the benefits provided to, all individuals who are or were
Employees. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall
Sellers, the Acquired Companies, the Acquired Company Subsidiaries or any
Affiliates of such entities be required to transfer the personnel files
(including, without limitation, any annual evaluations) of any Employees or
Allocated Employees. Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not
to, dispose of, alter or destroy any such personnel files until the later of
(i) seven (7) years after the Closing Date, or (ii) the time specified in the
Parents record retention guidelines as in effect on the date hereof.

  



  

SECTION 5.9. _WARN Act_. Buyer acknowledges that as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Sellers may terminate the
employment of the Listed Employees. Buyer and Sellers agree that for purposes
of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any similar
state statute (collectively, the " ** _WARN Act_** "), the Closing Date
shall be the "effective date of the sale" as such term is used in the WARN
Act. Sellers agree that prior to, on, or as of the Closing Date (as
determined by Sellers in their sole discretion), Sellers, the Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any
notification under the WARN Act with respect to the Listed Employees and the
Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries and Sellers agree
not to deliver such notification until they have been reviewed and approved
by Buyer, which approval

  



        
   

  



  

shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for any notification under the WARN Act with
respect to any Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated after the
Closing Date.

INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

SECTION 8.1. _Obligation to Indemnify_. (a) Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article VIII, Parent and each Seller, jointly and severally,
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, including,
after the Closing, the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company
Subsidiaries (the " ** _Buyer Indemnified Parties_** "), from and against all
losses and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses of outside counsel) but not including punitive,
exemplary, consequential and all other kinds of special damages (including,
without limitation, lost profits and opportunity costs) (" ** _Losses_** ")
to the extent actually incurred as a result of (i) any breach of the
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in Section 3.1, (ii) any
breach of any of the covenants and agreements of Sellers contained in this
Agreement or (iii) the Excluded Liabilities; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Parent nor any Seller shall have any indemnification liability under
this Agreement unless a claim is timely asserted during the survival period
specified in Section 7.1; and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither Parent
nor any Seller shall have any indemnification liability under this Agreement
unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Parent and Sellers would, but
for this proviso, be liable, pursuant to this Section 8.1(a)
exceeds $15,000,000 on a cumulative basis (the " ** _Deductible_** "), and
then only to the extent of any such excess; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
neither Parent nor any Seller shall have any liability under Section
8.1(a)(i) or Section 8.1(a)(ii) for any individual item of Loss that is less
than $25,000 (for this purpose any individual item shall include any series
of related actions) and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of
the second proviso to this Section 8.1(a). In any event, the maximum amount
for which Parent and Sellers shall be liable in the aggregate under
this Section 8.1(a) shall not exceed 20% of the Purchase Price, as adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.3 (the " ** _Indemnification Cap_** "); and _provided_ ,
_further_  that the Deductible and the Indemnification Cap shall not apply to
or limit Losses arising out of (w) any breach of the representations and
warranties of Sellers contained in Section 3.1(a), Section 3.1(b)
and Section 3.1(o), (x) a claim for indemnity pursuant to Section
9.1(a), (y) any breach of any of the covenants and agreements of Sellers
contained in this Agreement or (z) the Excluded Liabilities. Solely for
purposes of determining whether Parent or Sellers are obligated to provide
indemnification and the amount of any Losses for which Parent or Sellers
shall be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Section 8.1(a),
each representation and warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement shall
be read without regard and without giving effect to the terms "material," "in
all material respects" or "Company Material Adverse Effect."

  



  

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, Buyer agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless Parent, Sellers and their Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers and employees (" ** _Seller Indemnified
Parties_** ") from and against all Losses to the extent arising from or
related to (i) any breach of the representations and warranties of Buyer
contained in Section 3.2, (ii) any breach of any of the covenants and
agreements of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (iii) any transfer or
termination of a Transferred Employee or any transfer or termination of a
Listed Employee in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) the ownership after the Closing by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the Acquired Companies and the Acquired
Company Subsidiaries or the operation after the Closing of the business of
the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Company Subsidiaries, except to the
extent Buyer is entitled to indemnification by Sellers under Section

  



        
   

  



  

8.1(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not have any
indemnification liability under this Agreement unless a claim is timely
asserted during the survival period specified in Section 7.1; and _provided_
, _further_ , that Buyer shall not have any indemnification liability under
this Agreement unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Buyer would, but
for this proviso, be liable, pursuant to this Section 8.1(b), exceeds the
Deductible, and then only to the extent of any such excess; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Buyer shall not have any liability under Section 8.1(b)(i)
or Section 8.1(b)(ii) for any individual item of Loss that is less
than $25,000 (for this purpose any individual item shall include any series
of related actions) and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of
the second proviso to this Section 8.1(b). In any event, the maximum amount
for which Buyer shall be liable in the aggregate under this Section 8.1(b)
shall not exceed the Indemnification Cap; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
the Deductible and the Indemnification Cap shall not apply to or limit Losses
arising out of any breach of (w) the representations and warranties of Buyer
contained in Section 3.2(a), Section 3.2(f) and Section 3.2(g), (x) Section
9.1(b), (y) any breach of any of the covenants and agreements of Buyer
contained in this Agreement or (z) any transfer or termination of employment
of any Employee referred to in clause (iii) above. Solely for purposes
of determining whether Buyer is obligated to provide indemnification and
the amount of any Losses for which Buyer shall be liable to the Seller
Indemnified Parties under this Section 8.1(b), each representation and
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement shall be read without regard
and without giving effect to the terms "material," "in all material respects"
or "Buyer Material Adverse Effect."

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
including Section 8.1(a), with respect to any Tax Product Claim made against
Parent and Sellers, Parent and Sellers shall only indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties from and against any liability for (A) Taxes (whether or
not related to Taxes imposed on an Acquired Company, policyholder or annuity
holder) and (B) the present value (determined using a discount rate equal to
the AFR) of reasonable payments required to be made to policyholders, owners
or beneficiaries (including increases in benefits under the contracts), in
order to cause the annuity or life insurance contract to comply with the
applicable provisions of the Code (or any relevant Governmental Entitys
interpretation thereof), but not other external costs, expenses or Losses
(for example, external costs associated with correcting the policy forms,
associated or related to external advisors, or incurred with respect
to technology or computer systems) that are not otherwise included in (A)
or (B). For purposes of calculating the net present value of
amounts described in clause (B) in the immediately preceding sentence, the
present value of an increase in the benefits provided under a contract shall
be equal to the necessary increase in the relevant Insurance Companys
statutory accounting policy benefit reserve that results from such increase
in contract benefits. For purposes of (A) and (B), Parent and Sellers shall
only have an obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Party to the
extent that: (i) such liabilities are attributable to an annuity contract or
insurance policy issued on or before (1) the Closing Date or (2) with
respect to mortgage term life insurance products of the Insurance Companies
that are offered pursuant to a sales and distribution agreement that may not
be terminated by such Insurance Company without providing six (6)
months notice (the " ** _Distribution Agreement Related Products_** "), such
Distribution Agreement Related Products are actually issued by the Insurance
Companies prior to the earlier to occur of the date (x) that is exactly six
(6) months after the Closing Date or (y) on which the Insurance Companies or
Buyer can amend, alter or otherwise revise such Distribution Agreement
Related Products, using commercially reasonable efforts, to cause such
products to comply with the applicable provisions of the Code (the date

  



        
   

  



  

provided in (1) and (2) hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Tax
Product Determination Date_** "); (ii) the facts or reasons
for noncompliance with the Code that gave rise to any breach of such
representation existed as of the Closing Date; (iii) such breach of the
representation set forth in Section 3.1(m)(vii) is not the result of a change
in (1) Law or (2) interpretation of Law as such Law existed as of
the Closing Date, in each case that occurs after the Closing Date; and (iv)
such liabilities (in whole or in part) are not due to any action taken or any
action that should have been taken but that was not taken by Buyer or one of
its Affiliates after the Closing Date. The Parties agree that Section 8.1(a)
as modified by this Section 8.1(c) shall provide the Buyer Indemnified
Parties with their only recourse and sole claim for indemnification with
respect to any Taxes, Losses or liabilities relating to, resulting from or
attributable to any annuity contract or life insurance policy issued,
assumed, sold, exchanged, administered or marketed by the Acquired Companies
or the Acquired Company Subsidiaries not complying with an applicable
provision of the Code (or any relevant Governmental Entitys interpretation
thereof).

  



  

SECTION 8.2. _Indemnification Notice Procedures_. (a) Promptly after the
incurrence of any Losses by any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.1 (an " ** _Indemnified Party_** "), including any claim by a
third party described in Section 8.3, which might give rise
to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Party from which indemnification is sought (the " **
_Indemnifying Party_** ") a notice (the " ** _Indemnification Notice_** "),
which Indemnification Notice shall:

  



  

(i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or incurred Losses for which
such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement; and

  



  

(ii) specify in reasonable detail (and have annexed thereto all supporting
documentation, including any correspondence in connection with any Third
Party Claim and paid invoices for claimed Losses) each individual item of
Loss included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or
incurred, the basis for any anticipated liability and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which
each such item is related and the computation of the amount to which such
Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims
specified in any Indemnification Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall, within
forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such
Indemnification Notice, deliver to the Indemnified Party a notice to
such effect and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall,
within the sixty (60) day period beginning on the date of receipt by the
Indemnified Party of such objection, attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective Parties with respect to each of such claims to which
the Indemnifying Party shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party shall succeed in reaching agreement on their
respective rights with respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum
setting forth such agreement. Should the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to any particular item or items or
amount or amounts within such time period, then either the Indemnified Party
or the Indemnifying Party shall submit such dispute to a court of competent
jurisdiction as set forth in Section 11.7.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) Claims for Losses specified in any Indemnification Notice to which an
Indemnifying Party shall not object in writing within forty-five (45) days
after receipt of such Indemnification Notice, claims for Losses covered by a
memorandum of agreement of the nature described in Section 8.2(b), and claims
for Losses the validity and amount of which have been the subject of judicial
determination as described in Section 8.2(b) or shall have been settled with
the consent of the Indemnifying Party, as described in Section 8.3, are
hereinafter referred to, collectively, as " ** _Agreed Claims_**."  Within
ten (10) Business Days after the determination of the amount of any Agreed
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party an amount
equal to the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
the bank account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a notice
to the Indemnifying Party not less than two (2) Business Days prior to such
payment.

  



  

SECTION 8.3. _Third Party Claims_. (a) The Indemnified Party agrees to give
the Indemnifying Party notice in writing of the assertion of any claim or
demand made by, or an action, proceeding or investigation instituted by, any
Person not a Party to this Agreement (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** ") in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under Section 8.1 in accordance with
the notice procedures set forth in Section 8.2 promptly after such
Indemnified Party learns of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have
been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the
period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give such notice).
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
within five (5) calendar days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  



  

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party. The Parties agree that Sellers are hereby assuming
and will assume the defense of any claims related to or arising from the
Excluded Liabilities. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as
it conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party
shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof
(other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have not
yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the
Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, all
of the Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified

  



        
   

  



  

Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior
written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer is
made by a third party claimant solely for money damages, and the Indemnifying
Party notifies in writing the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Partys
willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable
limitations of this Article VIII, pay the amount called for by such offer,
and the Indemnified Party declines to accept such offer, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any
participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (i) the
amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnified Party declined to accept
_plus_ the other Losses of the Indemnified Party relating to such Third Party
Claim prior to the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (ii) the
aggregate Losses of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
including Sections 8.2 and 8.3, with respect to a Tax Product Claim: (i)
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the right to make any such claim against
Parent and Sellers prior to any Third Party Claim first having been made
against Buyer or any of its Affiliates if such claim is made prior to the
date that is exactly twelve (12) months after the Closing Date; (ii) that is
not based on a Third Party Claim, Buyer shall provide Sellers with written
notice of such claim in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section
8.2(a)(i) and Section 8.2(a)(ii); (iii) that is based on, includes or relates
to a Third Party Claim brought against a Buyer Indemnified Party (including
any Third Party Claims brought against a Buyer Indemnified Party after a
Buyer Indemnified Party first brought a Tax Product Claim against Parent and
Sellers), Buyer shall provide Parent and Sellers with written notice of such
Third Party Claim in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section
8.3(a); and (iv) Buyer shall control the conduct of all Third Party Claims
(including the negotiations of any agreements entered into with a Taxing
Authority or third party relating to such claim) that relate or give rise to
a Tax Product Claim (including the process of determining how to cause any
annuity or life insurance contract that relates to such claim to comply with
the applicable provisions of the Code (or any relevant Governmental Entitys
interpretation thereof) and implementing such method); _provided_ , _however_
, that Sellers or Parent shall control the conduct of any such claim with
respect to and to the extent that such claims could result in an indemnity
obligation by Parent and/or Sellers under this Agreement; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the non-controlling Party shall have the right to
participate in the conduct of any such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(d) If a Buyer Indemnified Party brings a Tax Product Claim against Parent
and/or Sellers, Parent and/or Sellers will have no obligation to pay to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties any amount due with respect to such claim until the
first to occur of: (i) a Final Determination having been reached with respect
to the matter that gave rise to such Tax Product Claim (including for these
purposes any closing agreements entered into by a Buyer Indemnified Party
with a Taxing Authority that reach a settlement with respect to the amount of
Tax that is due with respect to a Tax Product Claim); (ii) the settlement or
conclusion of all Third Party Claims related to such Tax Product Claim; or
(iii) Parent, Sellers and Buyer entering into a mutual agreement with respect
to the total amount that is due from Parent and Sellers with respect to such
Tax Product Claim.

  



        
   

  



  

(e) If a Buyer Indemnified Party brings a Tax Product Claim prior to a Third
Party Claim and Parent or Sellers do not agree with a matter relating to such
claim (including the steps to be taken to mitigate any such claim), then
Sellers shall provide Buyer with written notice of their objections setting
forth in reasonable detail these objections.  With respect to any such
disputed matters, Buyer and Sellers shall attempt in good-faith to settle
such disputes for a period of thirty (30) days after Buyer has received such
notice. If the Parties cannot settle such disputes within such time, Buyer
and Sellers shall submit their disputes to a Tax Referee for final settlement
as to the disputed issues. The decision of the Tax Referee shall be final
and binding on the Parties and the Parties shall not take any action or fail
to take any action that would be considered to be contrary to the decision of
the Tax Referee. The costs of the Tax Referee shall be shared equally by
Buyer and Parent.

  



  

SECTION 8.4. _Termination; Mitigation_. (a) The indemnities provided in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
indemnities provided under Section 8.1(a)(i) and Section 8.1(b)(i) shall
terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant
to Article VII, except as to any item as to which the Person to be
indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period,
previously made a claim by delivering a notice (stating in reasonable detail
the basis of such claim) to the Indemnifying Party.  After the Closing, the
indemnities provided in Section 8.1(a) and Section 8.1(b) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy at law for any breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby except that nothing set forth in this
Article VIII shall be deemed to prohibit or limit any Partys right at any
time on or after the Closing Date to seek injunctive or equitable relief for
the failure of any other Party to perform any covenant or agreement contained
herein or to seek any other relief based upon fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

  



  

(b) The amount of any indemnity payments under this Agreement shall be net of
any amounts reserved on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet or recovered or
recoverable by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or other
indemnification rights with respect to the relevant Losses. To the extent
that (i) CILAC or CILC receives after the Closing cash from the reimbursement
of legal fees or funds released from settlement pools ( _i.e_.,
"reverter" funds), in each case in connection with any Modal Premium
Litigation or other reimbursement related to the Excluded Liabilities, (ii)
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer receives any amounts under the Zurich
Agreement relating to any of the Excluded Liabilities or (iii) Buyer or any
Affiliate Buyer receives any indemnification payments in excess of reserves
therefor set forth on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet that relate to
claims for indemnification by any of the Sellers or their Affiliates that
were resolved prior to the Closing, Buyer shall promptly remit to Sellers
such amounts by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by
Sellers.

  



  

(c) The Indemnified Party shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take
all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of
any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto,
including incurring costs only to the extent reasonably necessary to remedy
the breach which gives rise to the Loss.  In the event that an Indemnified
Party shall fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Loss, then notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither Sellers nor Buyer, as the case may be, shall be required to
indemnify any Indemnified Party for that

  



        
   

  



  

portion of such Loss that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided
if the Indemnified Party had made such efforts.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in
the event that any fact, event or circumstance which results in an adjustment
to the Purchase Price (including the Final Adjustment Payment) would also
constitute a breach or inaccuracy of any of Sellers representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement, Sellers and their
respective Affiliates shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Party with respect to such breach or inaccuracy.

  



  

(e) Upon making any indemnification payment, the Indemnifying Party will, to
the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified
Party against any third party in respect of the Loss to which the payment
relates. Without limiting any other provision hereof, each such Indemnified
Party and Indemnifying Party will duly execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation
rights.

  



  

(f) Neither Sellers nor Buyer shall have any right to set-off any Losses
against any payments to be made by such Party or Parties pursuant to this
Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties.

  



  

SECTION 8.5. _Tax Indemnification_. Except with respect to indemnification
for the breach of a representation contained in Section 3.1(h) or Section
3.1(m)(vii), the rights and obligations of the Parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be exclusively governed by
Article IX hereof, and shall not be subject to this Article VIII, except for
the provisions of Sections 8.4(c), 8.4(d), 8.4(e) and 8.4(f).

  



  

ARTICLE IX

  



  

TAX MATTERS

  



  

SECTION 9.1. _Tax Indemnity_. (a) Parent and Sellers shall (except with
respect to any items relating to Transfer Taxes covered by Section 9.9) be
jointly and severally liable for and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer,
its Affiliates and the Acquired Companies from and against (i) any and
all Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax
Years (including any Taxes solely attributable to Section 338(h)(10)
Elections); (ii) any and all income Taxes imposed on any member of any
affiliated group with which any of the Acquired Companies filed a Tax Return
on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis for or during any Pre-Closing
Tax Years for which any of the Acquired Companies is liable pursuant
to Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision
of state or local Law), but only to the extent such income Taxes do not
relate to the income, gain, activities or business of any of the Acquired
Companies after the Closing Date; (iii) solely with respect to the
representations contained in Sections 3.1(i)(x) and 3.1(i)(xii) and subject
to the terms and conditions set forth therein and in Section 9.6, any and all
Taxes for all taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
expiration of the applicable Extended Termination Date provided in Section
9.6 that result from, arise out of or are based upon an inaccuracy or breach
of any such representation; and (iv) with respect to any inaccuracy or breach
of the representation

  



        
   

  



  

contained in Section 3.1(i)(xiv) and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein and in Sections 9.1(e) and 9.6, the net present value (using a
discount rate equal to the "applicable federal rate" published by the
Internal Revenue Service for the month in which the claim is brought by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement determined based on the period of time over which
such lost tax benefit must be discounted (the " ** _AFR_** ")) of the total
tax benefits that would have been available to Buyer or the Acquired
Companies had such representation not been breached; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the maximum amount for which Parent and Sellers shall be liable pursuant
to the indemnity set forth in this Section 9.1(a)(iv) shall not, in
the aggregate, exceed $25 million.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates from
and against any and all Taxes that are not specifically indemnified by
Sellers pursuant to Section 9.1(a) including (i) any Taxes that relate to or
are attributable to any action or transaction by, at the direction of, or
with Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any Affiliate of Buyer or the Acquired
Companies (A) before the Closing to the extent that such action is at the
sole direction of and for the benefit of Buyer (excluding any such action
that relates to any Pre-Closing Distributions) or (B) after the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of both (A) and (B), not including
any Taxes resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections and (ii) with
respect to any inaccuracy or breach of the representation contained
in Section 3.2(h) and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein
and in Sections 9.1(e) and 9.6, the net present value of the total tax
benefits that would have been available to Sellers had such
representation not been breached (which shall include the additional amount
of Taxes that Sellers or the Acquired Companies are required to pay as result
of such breach with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the maximum amount for which Buyer
shall be liable pursuant to the indemnity set forth in this Section
9.1(b)(ii) shall not, in the aggregate, exceed $8 million.

  



  

(c) For purposes of determining Sellers liability pursuant to Section 9.1(a)
with respect to Taxes that are payable for a taxable period that begins
before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (" ** _Straddle
Taxes_** "), the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Years shall be in the case of: (i) Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
or otherwise measured by the level of any item deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on
an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire period irrespective of the
lien or assessment date of such Taxes; (ii) Taxes imposed on or measured
by income, gross receipts, wages, expenses or other similar periodic measures
or imposed on sales, assignments or any other transfers of any property
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended
with the Closing Date (based on an interim closing of the books as of the
Closing); and (iii) Taxes imposed on the basis of premium deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable on the basis of the amount of the premium
written as of the Closing.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Sellers liability for Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Years pursuant to this
Agreement shall take into account and be offset by the amount of any
estimated Taxes paid by Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers (other than the
Acquired Companies) that are attributable to the income, gain, business or

  



        
   

  



  

activities of the Acquired Companies but only to the extent (i) Sellers have
not been reimbursed by the Acquired Companies for such amounts prior to the
Closing Date or (ii) such amounts have not been reflected as an asset that is
taken into account for purposes of calculating Adjusted Book Value or Final
Adjusted Book Value.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Buyer nor any Seller shall be entitled to bring any claim for indemnity
pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(iv) or 9.1(b)(ii) until such time as a Tax Claim
has first been brought against, as relevant, Buyer, Sellers or any of the
Acquired Companies.

  



  

SECTION 9.2. _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. (a) Subject to the
provisions of Section 9.2(e), Sellers shall cause each of the Acquired
Companies to prepare or cause to be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice (but only to the extent such past practices will not, in the
reasonable judgment of Sellers, cause Sellers or the Acquired Companies to
incur any additions to Taxes or penalties) and Requirements of Law and file
or cause to be filed on a timely basis all (i) Tax Returns for taxable years
that end on or before the Closing Date and (ii) consolidated, unitary,
combined or similar Tax Returns (the " ** _Consolidated Tax Returns_**
") that include the Acquired Companies and the relevant Seller or any
Affiliate of such Seller no matter when such taxable years end, and Sellers
shall pay all income Taxes payable under such Tax Returns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Sellers shall not be required to pay any Taxes shown on such
Tax Returns to the extent that any such Taxes are not income Taxes, such Tax
amounts are reflected on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and such Tax
amounts are taken into account in the calculation of Adjusted Book Value, in
which case such amount of Taxes shall be paid by the Acquired Companies and
shall not be subject to the indemnity provided in Section 9.1(a).

  



  

(b) Except as provided in Section 9.2(a), Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed (at the expense of the Acquired
Companies) on a timely basis all other Tax Returns with respect to the
Acquired Companies and, subject to Sellers indemnity for Taxes as provided
in Section 9.1(a), pay all Taxes reported as due on such Tax Returns.

  



  

(c) With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed or caused to be filed
by Sellers or Buyer pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b) with respect
to the Acquired Companies (such Party, the " ** _Filing Party_** ") and as
to which an amount of Tax is allocable to the Party that is not the Filing
Party (the " ** _Tax Indemnifying Party_** ") pursuant to Section 9.1(a)
or 9.1(b), the Filing Party shall provide the Tax Indemnifying Party and
its authorized representatives with a copy of such completed Tax Return or,
in the case of a Consolidated Tax Return, a pro forma Tax Return for each of
the relevant Acquired Companies (prepared on a separate company basis) and
a statement certifying and setting forth the calculation of the amount of
Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to such Tax Indemnifying
Party, together with appropriate supporting information and schedules at
least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date (including any
extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return or Consolidated Tax
Return, as the case may be, and such Tax Indemnifying Party and its
authorized representatives shall have the right to review and comment on such
Tax Return and statement, as the case may be, prior to the filing of such Tax
Return and shall provide to the Filing Party written notice of any objections
it has with respect to such Tax Returns (a " ** _Tax_**

  



        
   

  



  

 ** _Dispute_** ") no later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the date
when such Tax Return must be filed. In the event of any such objections, the
Parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve such dispute for a period of
five (5) Business Days; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such dispute is not
settled by such date (the " ** _Tax Dispute Date_** ") the Parties
shall submit all such disputed matters to an independent and mutually
selected nationally recognized accounting firm or law firm (the " ** _Tax
Referee_** ") within five (5) days after the Tax Dispute Date. The decision
by the Tax Referee shall be final and binding on the Parties.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the fees and
expenses relating to the Tax Referee shall be paid equally by each Party. If
the Tax Referee has failed to render a decision by the date that is three (3)
days prior to the date on which the disputed Tax Return must be filed, then
such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner consistent with the Tax
Indemnifying Partys position; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Tax
Referee renders a final decision that differs from the position advocated by
the Tax Indemnifying Party, such Tax Returns shall be amended to reflect the
final determination reached by the Tax Referee and the Tax Indemnifying Party
shall reimburse the Filing Party for any additional Taxes that the Tax
Indemnifying Party is required to pay pursuant to Section 9.1.

  



  

(d) Except with respect to a claim for indemnity made pursuant to Section
9.1(a)(iii) (which shall be made in accordance with Section 9.4(g)), payment
of any amounts due under this Article IX in respect of Taxes shall be made:
(i) except to the extent that there is a Tax Dispute or that a matter
relating to Taxes is being contested with a Taxing Authority, at least three
(3) Business Days before the due date of the applicable estimated or final
Tax Return required to be filed by the Filing Party that reports a Tax
liability for which a Tax Indemnifying Party is liable pursuant to this
Agreement; and (ii) with respect to a Tax Dispute or any matter relating to
Taxes which is being contested with a Taxing Authority, within three (3)
Business Days after the following: (A) an agreement between Sellers and Buyer
that an indemnity amount is payable; (B) a Final Determination having been
made by a Taxing Authority; (C) except in the case of a matter that is
being contested or will be contested with a Taxing Authority, an assessment
of a Tax by a Taxing Authority; or (D) in the event of a Tax Dispute, a
final determination by the Tax Referee. If liability under this Article
IX is in respect of an expense relating to the contest of a Tax matter,
payment of any amounts due under this Article IX shall be made as of the time
when the payment of the corresponding Tax is due pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(e) In the event that personnel required to prepare any Tax Returns Sellers
are required to cause to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i)
remain in the employ of the Acquired Companies or become employees of Buyer
or any Affiliate of Buyer after the Closing, Sellers may, at their sole
option and at Sellers expense, which expense shall be determined by
reference to the reasonable compensation, computed on an hourly basis, paid
to the personnel required to prepare such Tax Returns, request that such
personnel prepare such Tax Returns. Any such expense shall be paid by
Sellers promptly upon request by Buyer or the affected Acquired Companies.
Upon such event, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared such Tax Returns
on a timely basis and in a manner consistent with past practice (but only to
the extent such past practices will not, in the reasonable judgment of
Sellers, cause Sellers or the Acquired Companies to incur any additions to
Taxes or penalties) and Requirements of Law and shall provide to Sellers and
Sellers authorized representatives such Tax Return, together with
appropriate supporting information and schedules at least twenty (20) days
prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of
such Tax Return; _provided_ , _however_ , that

  



        
   

  



  

Sellers must notify Buyer in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to the
due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return
that they are exercising this option. Sellers and their authorized
representatives shall have the right to modify any such Tax Return prior to
the filing by Sellers of any such Tax Return.

  



  

SECTION 9.3. _Tax Refunds_. Rights and benefits relating to all credits or
refunds of Tax liabilities of the Acquired Companies no matter how secured
(including credits for overpayment of estimated Taxes) arising from or
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Years or a liability for Tax for which
Sellers have provided an indemnity under Section 9.1(a) shall remain with and
be for the benefit of Sellers, and Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount of
any such Tax refund or credit against Taxes received by Buyer or by any of
the Acquired Companies _plus_ any overpayment interest accruing from the date
the corresponding Tax liability was paid, but only to the extent such Tax
Refund was not included in the Final Adjusted Book Value. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and Sellers agree that
none of the Acquired Companies shall carry back any net operating loss, loss
from operations or any other Tax Attribute of any of the Acquired Companies
to any Pre-Closing Tax Years and Buyer agrees that it will indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers against any Losses or liabilities for Tax and expenses
related thereto (including any amounts of Taxes for which Sellers have
provided an indemnity pursuant to Section 9.1(a)) that are attributable to or
result or arise from a breach of the covenant provided in this sentence.

  



  

SECTION 9.4. _Tax Notice; Tax Controversies_. (a) Sellers and Buyer shall
provide to each other notice (in a form that satisfies the requirements
of Section 9.4(h)) within ten (10) days of receipt of any notice
of deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or
other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim in
which a Taxing Authority (a " ** _Tax Claim_** ") makes or proposes to make
a Tax adjustment to any Tax period which could reasonably result in the other
Party being liable for any amount of Taxes or losses related thereto, either
under the Law or pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the provisions of this Section 9.4(a) shall not apply with respect to notice
of claims related to the indemnification provided for under Section
9.1(a)(iii), which shall be governed solely by Section 9.4(g).

  



  

(b) Sellers, at their expense, shall control any Tax Claim that: (i) involves
a Consolidated Tax Return, combined or unitary return or any matter relating
to the Consolidated Group of which either Seller or an Affiliate is the
common parent (a " ** _Seller Consolidated Group Tax Claim_** "); or (ii)
could solely adversely affect the Taxes of Sellers or any Affiliate thereof
or could result in only Sellers being liable for any amount of Taxes or
losses related thereto, either under the Law or pursuant to this Agreement,
including (y) any Tax Claims related to that portion of the Straddle Taxes
allocable to Sellers under Section 9.1(c) and (z) any amount for which
Sellers could have to indemnify Buyer pursuant to the terms of Section
9.1(a). Buyer, at its expense, shall control any Tax Claim that could solely
adversely affect the Taxes of Buyer or any Affiliate thereof or could result
in only Buyer being liable for any amount of Taxes or losses related thereto,
either under the Law or pursuant to this Agreement, including any Tax Claims
related to that portion of the Straddle Taxes allocable to Buyer under
Section 9.1(c).

  



  

(c) If a Party does not assume the defense of any Tax Claim placed under its
control pursuant to 
 Section 9.4(b) (other than a Seller Consolidated Group Tax Claim), the
Party

  



        
   

  



  

not controlling the proceeding of such Tax Claim or its representative shall
(to the extent permitted by Law) have the right, at its expense, to control
any such Tax Claim (other than a Seller Consolidated Group Tax Claim). In
the event that any Tax Claim placed under Sellers control pursuant to
Section 9.4(b) is present in the same proceeding as a separate Tax Claim
placed under Buyers control pursuant to Section 9.4(b), each Party shall
have the right, at its expense, to control that portion of the Tax Claim over
which it would otherwise have control.

  



  

(d) With respect to a Tax Claim for which both Sellers and Buyer or the
Acquired Companies could be liable, or which involves an issue that recurs
for any period ending after the Closing Date (other than a Seller
Consolidated Group Tax Return and whether or not the subject of a Tax Claim
at such time), (i) each Party may participate in the Tax Claim and (ii) the
Tax Claim shall be controlled by that Party which would bear the burden of
the greater portion of the sum of any adjustment and any corresponding
adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for future Tax periods. The
principle set forth in the preceding sentence shall govern also for purposes
of deciding any issue that must be decided jointly (in particular, choice of
judicial forum) in situations in which separate issues are otherwise
controlled by Buyer and Sellers pursuant to Section 9.4(c).

  



  

(e) Other than with respect to a Seller Consolidated Group Tax Claim, the
Parties agree that they will not settle, compromise or agree to any Tax
adjustment which adversely affects or could adversely affect the other
Partys Tax liability (including the Tax liability of any Affiliate of the
other Party) without the prior written consent of the other Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Sellers shall have the right to settle or compromise any such proceedings
without the consent of Buyer to the extent that such settlement or compromise
will not adversely affect the Tax liability of the Acquired Companies after
the Closing Date.

  



  

(f) Each Seller shall exclusively control the conduct of all Seller
Consolidated Group Tax Claims that include such Seller and shall have sole
discretion in administering any such claims including the right to settle
such claims without the consent of Buyer or the Acquired Companies.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
with respect to a claim brought under Section 9.1(a)(iii), Buyer or its
Affiliates shall provide written notice to Parent and/or Sellers (in a form
that satisfies the requirements of Section 9.4(h)) with respect to any claim
that Buyer may have pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(iii). For purposes only of
any claim for indemnity pursuant to Sections 9.1(a)(iii) the Parties agree
that a claim for indemnity may be brought by Buyer against Parent and/or
Sellers even if no related Tax Claim has been asserted by a Taxing Authority
against Buyer or its Affiliates (a " ** _Pre-Tax Claim Notice_** "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such claim must be based on the reasonable
and good faith determination of Buyer or its Affiliate that a representation
contained in Section 3.1(i)(x) or 3.1(i)(xii) has been breached and must be
brought no later than the Extended Termination Date relating to such
representation. With respect to any Pre-Tax Claim Notice, Parent and Sellers
shall have no obligation to pay to Buyer or any of its Affiliates any amount
due with respect to any Pre-Tax Claim Notice until the first to occur of: (A)
a Final Determination having been reached with respect to the matter that
gave rise to such claim; or (B) Parent, Sellers and Buyer

  



        
   

  



  

entering into a mutual agreement with respect to the total amount that is due
from Parent and/or Sellers with respect to such claim.

  



  

(h) Any notice required under paragraphs (a) or (g) of this Section 9.4 shall
contain a summary of the facts underlying or relating to such claim, any
correspondence or notice received from any third party with respect thereto,
a statement that the Party bringing the claim seeks indemnification for Taxes
relating to such claim and the bases therefor and a good faith estimate of
the amount of Taxes (or range of Taxes) that such Party believes it has
incurred or will incur through the period ending on, as applicable, the
Closing Date or the Extended Termination Date, in each case based on the
information with respect thereto then known by such Party. From and after
the delivery of any notice required under Section 9.4(a) or Section 9.4(g),
the Party bringing a claim shall deliver to the other Party, within ten (10)
Business Days after such Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by such Party relating to such
claim. For purposes of clarification, if, subsequent to Buyer providing
Parent and Sellers with a Pre-Tax Claim Notice, a Tax Claim is brought with
respect to the same matter that is covered by the Pre-Tax Claim Notice, Buyer
shall be required to provide Parent and Sellers with all information relating
to such Tax Claim in the manner set forth in this Section 9.4(h).

  



  

(i) If Buyer provides Parent and Sellers with a Pre-Tax Claim Notice and
Parent and/or Sellers disputes such claim, then Parent or Sellers shall
provide Buyer with written notice of its objections in reasonable detail for
Buyer to determine the nature of Parents or Sellers objections and, for a
period of fifteen (15) days subsequent to the receipt of such notice, the
Parties shall attempt in good-faith to settle such disputes. If the Parties
cannot settle such disputes within such time, they shall submit their
disputes to a Tax Referee for final settlement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that in no event shall a determination made by the Tax Referee require Parent
or Sellers to make any indemnification payments to Buyer until such time as
Buyer or any of its Affiliates has actually incurred any Taxes relating to
such Pre-Tax Claim Notice. The decision of the Tax Referee shall be final
and binding on the Parties and the Parties will not take any action or fail
to take any action that would be considered to be contrary to the decision of
the Tax Referee. The costs of the Tax Referee shall be shared evenly by
Buyer and Parent.

  



  

SECTION 9.5. _Cooperation and Controversies_. (a) Sellers, Buyer and the
Acquired Companies shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, agents, auditors, representatives, officers and
employees reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns
(including amended returns and claims for refund), including maintaining and
making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes
and with respect to any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include but not be
limited to: (i) providing all relevant information that is available to
Buyer, Sellers and/or the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, with
respect to such Tax Claim; (ii) making personnel available at reasonable
times; and (iii) preparation of responses to requests for information;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall be done in a manner so as
to not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of business by Buyer, Sellers
or the Acquired Companies, as the case may be. Neither Sellers, the
Acquired Companies nor Buyer shall dispose of any Tax Returns, Tax schedules,
Tax workpapers or any books or records unless it first offers in writing to
the other Party the right to take possession of such materials at such
other Partys sole expense and the other Party fails to accept such offer
within fifteen (15) days of the offer being made or if an

  



        
   

  



  

offer is accepted and the offeree fails to take possession within thirty (30)
days of the date on which the offer is made. Any information obtained under
this Section 9.5 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund
or with respect to any Tax Claim.

  



  

(b) At Sellers request, Buyer will cause the Acquired Companies identified
by Sellers to join in filing with the appropriate Seller in any elections
under Section 1.1502-20(g) of the Treasury Regulations.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Buyer shall have
no right to obtain any information with respect to or regarding the combined,
consolidated, unified or group Tax Returns that are filed by Sellers and
Sellers Affiliates.

  



  

(d) Within 180 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Acquired
Companies (at the expense of the Acquired Companies) to prepare and provide
to Sellers a package of Tax information materials, including, without
limitation, schedules and work papers (the " ** _Tax Package_** ") required by
Sellers to enable Sellers to prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be
prepared and filed by Sellers pursuant to Section 9.2(a) and, upon
Sellers reasonable request, Buyer shall provide to Sellers any additional
information that may be requested by Sellers. The Tax Package shall be
prepared in good faith in a manner consistent with past practice. However,
the 180 day period will be extended in the event that the information needed
to prepare the Tax Package, including the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet,
is not available within 120 days after the Closing Date.

  



  

SECTION 9.6. _Survival_.  (a) All agreements, covenants and indemnification
matters contained in this Article IX shall survive the Closing until the
expiration of the applicable statutory period of limitation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1(i)
shall terminate and have no continuing effect after the Closing, except for
the representations contained in (A) Section 3.1(i)(x) and Section
3.1(i)(xii), which shall survive twelve (12) months after the Closing Date
and (B) Section 3.1(i)(xiv), which shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for the 2007 tax years of each of the
Section 338(h)(10) Companies (giving effect to any valid extensions, waivers,
and tolling periods that would extend such statute of limitations), but
which, in no event, shall survive beyond the date that is exactly five (5)
years after the date on which the Tax Return for the 2007 tax years of each
of the Section 338(h)(10) Companies was filed. The representation set forth
in Section 3.2(h) shall survive until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations for the 2007 tax years of each of the Section
338(h)(10) Companies (giving effect to any valid extensions, waivers, and
tolling periods that would extend such statute of limitations), but, in no
event, shall survive beyond the date that is exactly five (5) years after the
date on which the Tax Return for the 2007 tax years of each of the Section
338(h)(10) Companies was filed.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
(including Section 9.6(c)), the representation set forth in Section
3.1(i)(xii) shall survive Closing and shall terminate and expire as specified
in Section 9.6(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any breach
of such representation, Parent and Sellers shall only indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and the Acquired Companies (and any Affiliates thereof) from
and against any

  



        
   

  



  

penalties relating to Taxes imposed by a Taxing Authority under the Code to
the extent that such liability for penalties results solely from an Acquired
Company not having complied with the specific disclosure requirements or list
maintenance rules set forth in Sections 6011, 6111 or 6112 of the Code.

  



  

(c) With respect to the representations contained in Sections 3.1(i)(x) and
3.1(i)(xii), neither Parent nor Sellers shall have any indemnification
obligation for any Taxes, Liabilities or Losses that are allocable to any
period or portion thereof beginning immediately after the relevant Extended
Termination Date. With respect to the representations contained in Sections
3.1(i)(xiv) and Section 3.2(h), neither Buyer nor Parent and Sellers shall
have any indemnification obligation for any Taxes, Liabilities or Losses
except as specifically set forth in Sections 9.1(a)(iv) and 9.1(b)(ii). For
any other representation or warranty contained in Section 3.1(i), neither
Parent nor Sellers shall have any indemnification obligation for any Taxes,
Liabilities or Losses that are allocable to any period or portion thereof
beginning after the Closing, including any period or portion thereof
beginning immediately after the Closing.

  



  

SECTION 9.7. _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. As of the Closing
Date, Sellers shall cause all Tax allocation, Tax sharing, Tax reimbursement
and similar agreements and arrangements (" ** _Tax Sharing Agreements_**
") between Sellers, on the one hand, and the Acquired Companies, on the
other, to be extinguished and terminated with respect to the Acquired
Companies; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such termination shall not excuse
the Acquired Companies from making all payments due to Sellers or any
Affiliate of Sellers (other than the Acquired Companies) under such Tax
Sharing Agreements as determined as of the Closing Date (including all
reasonable costs and expenses associated with preparing the Tax Returns on
which such income Taxes will be reported).  The payment and calculation of
any payments due and owing with respect to the preceding sentence shall be
made in a time and manner consistent with past practice.

  



  

SECTION 9.8. _Exclusivity_.  Except as provided in Section 3.1(i) with
respect to representations and warranties relating to Tax matters, in
Sections 8.1, 8.3 and 8.4 with respect to Tax Product Claims, or in Section
8.5, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
this Article IX shall control all matters relating to Taxes and any claims,
liabilities, damages, deficiencies, obligations, costs or expenses, penalties
and reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements related thereto.

  



  

SECTION 9.9. _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Sellers shall be equally
responsible for and shall each pay 50% of any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer, and stamp taxes;
any transfer, recording, registration and other fees; and any similar Taxes
which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, " ** _Transfer Taxes_** ").  Buyer and Sellers
shall be responsible for jointly preparing and timely filing any Tax Returns
required with respect to any such Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Sellers shall
provide to one another a true copy of each such Tax Return as filed and
evidence of the timely filing thereof. Buyer and Sellers shall file such
applications and documents as shall permit any such Tax to be assessed and
paid on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with any available pre-
sale filing procedure.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 9.10. _Miscellaneous_.  (a) For purposes of this Article IX, all
references to the Acquired Companies are intended to include the Acquired
Company Subsidiaries both collectively and individually as the context of
such reference dictates.

  



  

(b) Sellers and Buyer agree to treat all payments made by either of them to
or for the benefit of the other (including any payments to any Acquired
Company) under this Article IX or under other indemnity provisions of this
Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and agree
that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to the extent
that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise.

  



  

SECTION 9.11. _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.  (a) Buyer, Sellers and any
necessary Affiliates (or Parent if necessary) thereof shall join in making an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (or any identical or similar
provisions under state or local Law) with respect to the Acquired Companies
(the " ** _Section 338(h)(10) Companies_**") for which such an election can
be filed (the " ** _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_**"). At least fifteen
(15) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and provide
to Sellers, with Sellers cooperation, drafts of the IRS Forms 8023 (the " **
_Forms 8023_** ") on which any such Section 338(h)(10) Elections shall be
made for Sellers review and comments, which comments shall be provided to
Buyer no later than eight (8) days prior to the Closing Date, and at or prior
to the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer and Buyer shall deliver to
Sellers properly executed and mutually agreed upon Forms 8023 with respect to
each Section 338(h)(10) Company containing information then available, which
Buyer shall file or cause to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service not
later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) For purposes of making such Section 338(h)(10) Elections, Buyer shall
initially determine the value of the tangible and intangible assets of the
affected entities and shall within 120 days of the Closing Date
provide Sellers with an allocation of Buyers "adjusted grossed-up basis" in
the shares of the Section 338(h)(10) Companies (within the meaning of
the Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of the Code, including
proposed Section 1.338-11 of the Treasury Regulations) to such assets (the "
** _Allocation_** "). If on the date that is 150 days after the Closing Date
any adjustments to Buyers "adjusted grossed-up basis" in the shares of the
Section 338(h)(10) Companies are necessary, Buyer shall provide Sellers with
an allocation of the "adjusted grossed-up basis," so adjusted, among the
tangible and intangible assets of the affected entities (the " **
_Adjusted Allocation_** "). The Allocation and the Adjusted Allocation, if
any, shall be in writing and shall be binding upon Buyer and Sellers
for purposes of allocating the "deemed selling price" (within the meaning of
the Treasury Regulations) among the assets of the affected entities;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if either Seller disagrees with all or a
portion of the Allocation or the Adjusted Allocation and Buyer and Sellers
cannot resolve their disagreement within thirty (30) days after notification
thereof by the objecting Seller to Buyer, Ernst and Young LLP or if such
accounting firm is not available, an independent certified public accounting
firm of national standing and reputation jointly selected and retained by
Buyer and Sellers that is not an independent auditor for either Buyer or
Sellers (the " ** _Independent Accounting Firm_** "), shall determine (i)
whether the Allocation or the Adjusted Allocation is incorrect and (ii) any
adjustments as may be necessary thereto, and the determination of such
Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and made no later than fifteen
(15) days prior to the date when any part of a Section 338(h)(10) Election
must be filed with a Taxing Authority. The Parties shall be bound

  



        
   

  



  

by the Allocation or the Adjusted Allocation, as applicable, as adjusted by
such Independent Accounting Firm.

  



  

(c) Neither Sellers nor Buyer shall file any Tax Return, or take a position
with a Taxing Authority, that is inconsistent with the Allocation or the
Adjusted Allocation that is applicable to each Seller.

at any time prior to the Closing:

  



  

(a) by Sellers or Buyer in writing, if any order, injunction or decree of any

final and nonappealable, or if any statute shall have been enacted, or if any
rule or regulation shall have been promulgated by any Governmental Entity,
that prohibits or restrains any Party from consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(b) by Sellers or Buyer in writing, if the Closing has not occurred on or
prior to December 31, 2006; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to

the Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before such date;

  



  

(c) by Sellers or Buyer, if there shall have been a breach by Buyer or
Sellers, respectively, of any of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations contained herein, which breach would
result in the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Section 6.1 or
Section 6.3 (in the case of a breach by Buyer) or Section 6.1 or Section 6.2
(in the case of a breach by Sellers), and in any such case such breach shall
be incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have

(b) BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER SELLERS, NOR ANY AFFILIATE, OFFICER,
DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE, REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT THEREOF MAKES OR HAS MADE ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ANY OTHER INDUCEMENT OR

SECTION 11.6. _Assignment_.  Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or
obligations of any Party shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation
of law or otherwise by such Party without the prior written consent of the

and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) prior to the Closing, subject to

subsidiary of Buyer, any or all of its rights hereunder, including the right
to purchase any of the Acquired Company Shares, and (b) after the Closing (i)
Sellers may assign any or all of their rights hereunder to any Affiliate and
(ii) Buyer may assign any or all of its rights hereunder to any direct or

successors and assigns.

be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any
covenant or agreement contained herein and to enforce specifically such terms
and provisions in any court of the United States or any state court which in
either case is located in the City of New York (any such federal or state
court, a " ** _New York Court_** "), in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, each of the Parties (a) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of any New York Court in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny

  



        
   

  



  

or defeat such personal jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for
leave from any such New York Court.

have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.

Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 11.9. _Severability_.  Whenever possible, each provision or portion
of any provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to
be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion
of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and
this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.

  



  

SECTION 11.10. _Amendment; Modification and Waiver_. This Agreement may be
amended, superseded, cancelled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may
be waived, only by a written instrument signed by each of the Parties or, in
the case of a waiver, by the Party waiving compliance. No delay on the part
of any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of
any right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

  



  

SECTION 11.11. _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties.
