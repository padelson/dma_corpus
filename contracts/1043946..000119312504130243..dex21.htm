Stock issued upon conversion or exercise of outstanding B2e Options, B2e
Warrants and any other security directly or indirectly convertible into or
exercisable for shares of B2e Preferred Stock) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Verticalnet,
Acquisition Sub, B2e or the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as follows:



(i) With regard to each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares
of Verticalnet Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the
product of (i) 5,100,000 shares of Verticalnet Common Stock (the "
_Stock Consideration_ ") _multiplied by_ (ii) the Series B Consideration
Ratio, by (B) the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;



(ii) With regard to each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares
of Verticalnet Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the
product of (i) the Stock Consideration _multiplied by_ (ii) the Series A
Consideration Ratio, by (B) the total number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;
and



(iii) For the benefit of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the
Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, based on the Series A Consideration Ratio and the Series
B Consideration Ratio, respectively, cash equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (A) the difference of (1) the product of (a) 3,900,000 shares of
Verticalnet Common Stock  _multiplied by_ (b) an amount equal to a 25%
premium to the Closing Date Average Price, _minus_ (2) the B2e Transaction
Expenses paid by Verticalnet at Closing (the " _Note Consideration_ "), by (B)
the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,

amount equal to the Note Consideration bearing interest at eight percent per
annum in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Merger
Note_ ").



(b) The value of the Merger Consideration shall be subject to
downward adjustment only for the Working Capital Adjustment prepared in
accordance with _Section 2.13_. The Working Capital Adjustment shall reduce
the principal amount payable by Verticalnet under the Merger Note on a dollar-
for-dollar basis. Any amounts payable by Verticalnet under the Merger Note
which are reduced pursuant to this _Section 2.06_ shall be considered
cancelled and shall no longer be due or payable by Verticalnet under the
Merger Note.



(c) The Merger Note shall provide that at the option of either Verticalnet
or the Stockholders Representative, the Merger Note may be converted into
shares of Verticalnet Common Stock at a conversion price per share equal to a
25% premium to the Closing Date Average Price (the " _Contingent

the Contingent Conversion Provision shall not be effective unless and until
Verticalnets shareholders have approved the Contingent Conversion Provision
in accordance with applicable Law and the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq
Stock Market. If the Contingent Conversion Provision is exercised, a number of
shares of Verticalnet Common Stock (the " _Escrow Shares_ ") equal to the
quotient of (i) the difference of (A) ten percent of the Merger Consideration
minus (B) the aggregate amount set-off under this Merger Note to cover any
indemnification claims of the Indemnified Parties under this Agreement,
divided by (ii) a conversion price per share equal to a 25% premium to the
Closing Date Average Price. The Escrow Shares shall be deposited with an
escrow agent mutually acceptable to Verticalnet and the Stockholders



 

12 Representative to be held by such escrow agent as security for indemnification
claims of the Indemnified Parties under this Agreement until the nine month
anniversary of the Closing Date (unless distributed earlier to pay such
indemnification claims) pursuant to a mutually acceptable escrow agreement.
The escrow agreement shall contain a provision substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Appendix A_.



(d) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, all unexercised warrants
to purchase shares of B2e Capital Stock outstanding (the " _B2e Warrants_ ")
shall be canceled and terminated, and each B2e Warrant shall cease to
represent a right to acquire B2e Capital Stock. B2e shall provide each holder
of a B2e Warrant with written notice notifying them that such holders B2e
Warrant will be cancelled if not immediately exercised by such holder prior to
the Effective Time. To the extent that consent from any holder of a B2e
Warrant is required under the terms of any B2e Warrant in order to terminate
such B2e Warrant in accordance with this _Section 2.06(d)_ , B2e shall obtain
such consent prior to the Effective Time. Neither Verticalnet nor the
Surviving Corporation shall assume any B2e Warrants after the Merger.



(e) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, all unexercised options to
purchase shares of B2e Capital Stock (whether or not vested) outstanding (the
" _B2e Options_ ") shall be canceled and terminated, and each B2e Option
shall cease to represent a right to acquire B2e Capital Stock. To the extent
that consent from any holder of a B2e Option is required under the terms of
the Stock Option Plan or any B2e Option in order to cancel such B2e Option in
accordance with this _Section 2.06(e)_ , B2e shall obtain such consent prior
to the Effective Time. Neither Verticalnet nor the Surviving Corporation shall
assume any B2e Option after the Merger.



(f) In the event any certificates evidencing shares of B2e Preferred
Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Verticalnet shall issue
certificates representing that number of shares of Stock Consideration in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates as such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificates would entitle the Stockholder to receive under
_Section 2.06_ , upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Stockholder; _provided_ , _however_ , that Verticalnet may, in its sole and
absolute discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the Stockholder, in such case, to provide an indemnity or deliver a
bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as security against any claim
that may be made against Verticalnet with respect to such certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



(g) At the Effective Time all shares of B2e Common Stock shall be cancelled
and no longer deemed to be outstanding and no shares of Verticalnet Common
Stock or any other security or cash shall be issuable in connection
therewith. 



(h) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of  _Section 2.09_ ,
each share of B2e Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the certificates representing such shares (" _Certificates_
") shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes, only the
right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration that such share of
B2e Preferred Stock would entitle the holder thereof to receive hereunder. Any
shares of B2e Capital Stock held in the treasury of B2e shall be canceled. 



(i) No fractional shares of Verticalnet Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger. All fractional shares of Verticalnet Common Stock that a Stockholder
would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be
aggregated and if a fractional share of Verticalnet Common Stock results from
such aggregation, the Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu
thereof, an amount in cash equal to the value thereof as of the Closing Date
determined in accordance with _Section 1.02_.



 

13 (j) All shares of Verticalnet Common Stock deliverable to any Stockholder
under this _Section 2.06_  shall be subject to the terms of the Registration
Rights Agreement and the Stockholders agreement to be bound by the terms
thereof is a condition to the issuance of such shares.



2.07 _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of capital
stock of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Verticalnet, Acquisition Sub or B2e, be converted into one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.



2.08 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, those shares of B2e Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by stockholders who did not vote in
favor of the Merger and who comply with all of the relevant provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and
until such stockholders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the DGCL, and any such
stockholder shall have only such rights in respect of the Dissenting Shares
owned by them as are provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such
stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, such stockholders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the
Effective Time, for the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration
without any interest thereon, pursuant to the terms of _Section 2.06_.



2.09 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.



(a) At and after the Effective Time, each Stockholder shall deliver the

no basis therefor.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF VERTICALNET



As of the date of this Agreement, Verticalnet hereby represents and warrants
to B2e as follows:



4.01 _Due Organization_. Each Acquiring Party is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its Assets and to carry on its business in
the places and in the manner as now conducted. Each Acquiring Party is
authorized, qualified or licensed in all jurisdictions where such
authorization, qualification or license is required, except where the failure
to be so authorized, qualified or licensed would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on or materially restrict the business, operations, results of
operations, Assets, prospects or condition, financial or otherwise, of such
Acquiring Party.



4.02 _Authorization; Validity_. Each Acquiring Party has the corporate power,
authority and legal right to execute and deliver this Agreement and any other
Transaction Document to which it is a party and to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and any
other Transaction Document to which an Acquiring Party is a party and the
performance of such Acquiring Partys obligations hereunder and thereunder
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. This Agreement
and such Transaction Documents have been duly executed and delivered
on behalf of each Acquiring Party by a duly authorized officer, and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Acquiring Party
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.



4.03 _No Conflicts_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.03_ , the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and any other Transaction Document to which an
Acquiring Party is a party and the performance of such Acquiring Partys
obligations hereunder and thereunder do not, and could not



 

37 reasonably be expected to, constitute a Default under (a) any Law or Court
Order to which such Acquiring Party is subject or (b) the Charter Documents
of such Acquiring Party or any securities issued by such Acquiring Party; nor
does or could such execution, delivery or performance result in a Default
under any term, condition or provision of any Contract, indenture, plan or
Governmental Permit to which such Acquiring Party is a party, by which such
Acquiring Party may have rights or by which any of the Assets of such
Acquiring Party may be bound or affected, or give any party with rights
thereunder the right to terminate, modify, accelerate or otherwise change the
existing rights or obligations of such Acquiring Party thereunder. Except as

503 under the Securities Act and filings under state blue sky laws, no
authorization, approval or consent, and no registration or filing with, any
Governmental Body is required in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Acquiring Parties or the consummation of
the Transactions.



4.04 _Public Filings_. Verticalnet has filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (" _SEC_ ") all reports required to be filed pursuant to Sections
13(a), 14 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to be filed by Verticalnet since
December 31, 2001 (collectively, and in each case including all amendments
thereto, the " _Public Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, except to
the extent revised or superseded by a subsequent filing with the SEC, the
Public Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Exchange Act, and none of the Public Documents (including any and all
financial statements included therein) as of such dates and as of the date
hereof contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements
of Verticalnet included the Public Documents, including any amendments
thereto, comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, and such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Verticalnet and its
subsidiaries at the dates thereof and the results of their operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended in accordance with GAAP.



4.05 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the financial statements included in
the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, there
has not been any change that by itself or in conjunction with all other such
changes, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Verticalnet, except as disclosed in the Public Documents to the date
of this Agreement.



4.06 _No Brokers or Finders_. No Person acting on behalf of the Acquiring
Parties is entitled to any brokerage, finders, investment banking or similar
fee in connection with the Transactions.

Stockholders will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable.



4.08 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
action, suit, claim or proceeding of any nature pending or, to Verticalnets
Knowledge, threatened, against Verticalnet or any of Verticalnets
subsidiaries that questions the validity of this Agreement or the right of
Verticalnet to enter into this Agreement or the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party or to consummate any transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.



4.09 _Capital Stock of Verticalnet_. The authorized capital stock of
Verticalnet consists of 100,000,000 shares of Verticalnet Common Stock, of
which 25,800,097 shares were issued and outstanding as of May 31, 2004 and
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, none of which
is issued or outstanding. Such issued and outstanding shares of Verticalnet

Closing, Verticalnet has reserved for issuance, pursuant to its currently
active stock option plans, 7,545,186 shares of its common stock. As of the
Closing, there are outstanding options to purchase 7,138,998 shares of
Verticalnet Common Stock pursuant to such plans.



 

38 4.10 _Compliance with Law_. To the Knowledge of Verticalnet, each Acquiring
Party has complied with, and is not in Default under, any Law to which it or
its Assets or operations or business is subject and has not failed to obtain
or to adhere to the requirements of any Governmental Permit necessary to the

non-compliance, Default or failure is not reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Verticalnet, no Acquiring Party,
or any officer, employee or agent of, nor any consultant to, any Acquiring
Party has unlawfully offered, paid or agreed to pay, directly or indirectly,
any money or anything of value to, or for the benefit of, any individual who
is or was a candidate for public office (other than lawful
campaign contributions), or an official or employee of any Governmental Body
or an officer or employee of any client, customer or supplier of any Acquiring
Party. In addition, to the Knowledge of Verticalnet, no Acquiring Party has
made, offered or agreed to offer anything of value to any governmental
official, political party or candidate for government office, nor has it
otherwise taken or failed to take any action that has caused or may cause such
Acquiring Party to be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977, as amended, or any Law of similar effect. To the Knowledge of
Verticalnet, no Acquiring Party has engaged in any transaction, maintained any
bank account or used any corporate funds except for transactions,
bank accounts and funds which have been and are reflected in their normally
maintained books and records. Verticalnet has no Knowledge of any reason that
the Merger may not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

(a) Verticalnet shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be

to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date. Each such Tax
Return (i) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior practice
of the relevant B2e Group Member unless otherwise required by applicable Tax
laws; (ii) shall be provided to the Stockholders Representative at least 15
days prior to the due date for filing such return; and (iii) shall not be
filed unless the Stockholders Representative shall have approved such return
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).



(b) Verticalnet shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of B2e Group Members for Tax periods which begin before
the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date. To the extent any Tax shown
as due on such Tax Return is payable by the Stockholders (taking into account
indemnification obligations hereunder), each such Tax Return (i) shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the relevant B2e
Group Member unless otherwise required by applicable Tax laws; (ii) shall be
provided to the Stockholders Representative at least 15 days prior to the
due date for filing such return; and (iii) shall not be filed unless the
Stockholders Representative shall have approved such return (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).



 

40 (c) Verticalnet and the Stockholders Representative shall, and shall each
cause their respective Affiliates to, provide to the other such cooperation
and information, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with
the filing of any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
determining liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes, or in
conducting any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all
relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with relevant
accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents relating
to rulings and other determinations by Taxing authorities, and relevant
records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property, which any such
party may possess. Each party will retain all Tax Returns, schedules, work
papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters,
of the B2e Group for the Tax period first ending after the Closing Date and
for all prior Tax periods until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notice is provided with respect thereto, any
extensions thereof) for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other
documents relate. Thereafter, the party holding such Tax Returns or
other documents may dispose of them, _provided_ that such party shall give
the notice as described in _Section 7.06_ to the other party prior to doing
so, and permit such other party, at such other partys expense, to examine and
make copies of any relevant documents for its own records.



(d) In the case of Taxes arising in a taxable period of any B2e Group Member
that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date, except as provided in
paragraph (e) below, the allocation of such Taxes between the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period shall be made on the basis of an
interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this paragraph (d), any Tax resulting from
the Transactions is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.



(e) In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are
payable for a taxable period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing
Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable
period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) except as provided in (ii) and
(iii) below, to the extent feasible, be determined on a specific
identification basis, according to the date of the event or transaction giving
rise to the Tax, (ii) in the case of any Taxes that are periodically assessed
and Taxes not otherwise reasonably allocable to specific transactions or
events, other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, or
franchise Taxes, or Taxes based on capitalization, debt or shares of stock
authorized, issued or outstanding, or ad valorem Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire taxable period, and (iii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related
to income or receipts, or franchise Taxes, or Taxes based on capitalization,
debt or shares of stock authorized, issued or outstanding, or ad valorem
Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant
taxable period ended as of the end of the Closing Date. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a
manner consistent with the prior practice of the B2e Group.



(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Stockholders
and Verticalnet shall share equally in the payment of all sales, use,
transfer, real property transfer, recording, documentary, stamp, registration,
stock transfer, and other similar taxes and fees, including penalties and
interest (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
Transactions and shall cause to be filed all necessary documentation and Tax
Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.



 

41 (g) To the extent any determination of Tax liability of a B2e Group Member,
whether as the result of an audit or examination, a claim for refund, the
filing of an amended Tax Return or otherwise, results in any refund or credit
of Taxes paid for which the Stockholders have responsibility for
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(ii), Verticalnet shall promptly
pay any such refund (to the extent that it exceeds the amount thereof taken
into account in the Working Capital Adjustment), and the interest actually
received thereon, to the Stockholders Representative upon receipt thereof
by Verticalnet. Any payments made under this Section shall be net of any
Taxes payable with respect to the receipt by Verticalnet or any of its
Affiliates of such refund, credit or interest thereon.



(h) The Parties agree, upon request, to use reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
otherwise be imposed with respect to a taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date).



(i) Any and all Tax allocation or sharing agreements or other agreements or
arrangements the principal purpose of which is to allocate liability for Taxes
binding B2e Group Members shall be terminated with respect to them as of the
day before the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, B2e Group
Members shall not be obligated to make any payment to any Person or authority
pursuant to any such agreement or arrangement for any past or future period.



(j) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, no party may amend a Tax
Return of a B2e Group Member, or file or amend any Tax election of or with
respect to a B2e Group Member, in each case, with respect to a taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date without the consent of the Stockholders
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



(k) Any Party who receives any notice of a pending or threatened Tax audit,
assessment, or adjustment against or with respect to any B2e Group Member
which may give rise to liability of another Party hereto, shall promptly
notify such other Party within ten (10) business days of the receipt of such
notice. The Parties each agree to consult with and to keep the other Parties
hereto informed on a regular basis regarding the status of any Tax audit or
proceeding to the extent that such audit or proceeding could affect a
liability of such other Parties (including indemnity obligations hereunder).



(l) On the Closing Date, Verticalnet shall not cause or permit any B2e Group
Member, or any Affiliate of Verticalnet to effect any extraordinary
transactions (including, but not limited to, the distribution of any dividend
or the effectuation of any redemption) other than as contemplated by this
Agreement, that could give rise to any Tax liability indemnified by the
Stockholders pursuant to Section 6.01



ARTICLE 6.

Liabilities, losses, claims, damages, fines, penalties, assessments,
adjustments, settlement payments, deficiencies, diminution in value, costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of
investigation) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") suffered, sustained, incurred or
paid by the Verticalnet Indemnified Parties in connection with, resulting
from or arising out of, directly or indirectly, the items set forth in
paragraphs (i)  (iv) below, to the extent



 

42 that any Loss is not reflected in the determination of the Working Capital
Adjustment, for a period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the date
that is:



(i) nine months after the Closing, for any breach of any representation or
warranty of B2e or any Stockholder set forth in this Agreement, any
Transaction Document or in any certificate or other writing delivered by B2e
or any Stockholder in connection herewith not covered by paragraphs (ii) and
(iii) below;



(ii) 30 days after the date of expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, for any Tax imposed upon or relating (the " _Statute of
Limitation Claims_ ") to:



(A) any B2e Group Member with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period;



(B) any Relevant Group of which any B2e Group Member (or any of
their predecessors) is or was a member pursuant to Section 1.1502-6 of the
Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of applicable Law) on or before
the Closing Date;



(C) any B2e Group Member as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Stockholders Representatives
share of Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 5.09(f)) to the extent allocable
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period;



(D) any B2e Group Member as a transferee or successor, by Contract, or
otherwise, based on circumstances that establish such status existing on or
before the Closing Date; and



(E) any claims asserted against the Surviving Corporation or its Assets by
reason for the failure of any Person to comply with bulk sales Laws and other
similar Laws pursuant to _Section 7.05_.



(iii) 30 days after the date of expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, for any claims (the " _Securityholder Claims_ ") by (A) any
holder or former holder of B2e securities relating to the allocation of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.06_ , including without
limitation, any assertion of appraisal rights by any such holder under
applicable Law and (B) any holder or former holder of options or warrants to
purchase any shares of B2e Capital Stock regarding the termination of such
options or warrants or the failure of any B2e Group Member to comply any with
the terms and conditions of such options or warrants; and



(iv) 30 days after the date of expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, for any claims under or with respect to the Management Letter
Agreements (the " _Management Agreement Claims_ ").



(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article 6_ , except
as provided below in this _Section 6.01_ , the Verticalnet Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section 6.01(a)(i)_ only
when the aggregate of all Losses of such Verticalnet Indemnified Parties under
_Section 6.01(a)(i)_ exceeds $100,000 (the " _Threshold_ ") and, if the
Threshold is exceeded, to the extent such Losses exceed the Threshold up to an
amount equal to 10% of the Merger Consideration (the " _Indemnification Cap_
"). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the
Threshold nor the Indemnification Cap shall apply to (i) any breach of the
representations or warranties under _Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.28_
(the " _Excepted Representations_ ") or in the related provisions of any
certificates to be delivered at the Closing by B2e or any Stockholder, (ii) a
breach of any representation or warranty of B2e or any Stockholder that was
made with an intent to mislead or defraud or with a reckless disregard of the



 

43 accuracy thereof, (iii) Securityholder Claims or (iv) Management Agreement
Claims. The Indemnification Cap but not the Threshold shall apply to the
Statute of Limitation Claims and any breach of the representations or
warranties contained in _Section 3.22_. In addition, the calculation of the
Threshold under this _Section 6.01_ shall include any Losses incurred by any
Verticalnet Indemnified Party for which a Verticalnet Indemnified Party would
have been entitled to claim indemnification under this _Article 6_ with
respect to a breach of a representation or warranty but for such Losses
being excluded as a result of the qualification of such representation or
warranty by materiality, Material Adverse Effect or related exceptions.



(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, in the Charter Documents
of any B2e Group Member, or in any agreement between B2e and any
Stockholder to the contrary, in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
obligated to reimburse, contribute, indemnify or hold harmless any Stockholder
for or in connection with any of the Liabilities of the Stockholders under
this _Article 6._ No Stockholder shall have the right to exercise or assert,
any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against
the Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or
any other Liability to which such Stockholder may become subject under or in
connection with this Agreement.



(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Stockholders shall
not be liable for indemnification with respect to income taxes incurred by the
B2e Group Members as a result of the Merger failing to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



6.02 _Stockholders Indemnification Procedures_. All claims or demands for
indemnification under _Section 6.01_ shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:



(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which the Stockholders (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") would be liable to a Verticalnet Indemnified Party
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") hereunder is asserted against an Indemnified
Party by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness
notify the Stockholders Representative of such claim or demand (the " _Claim
Notice_ "), specifying the nature of such claim or demand and the amount or
the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall
not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim or demand). The
Stockholders Representative shall have fourteen days from the receipt of the
Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party (i)
whether or not the Stockholders Representative disputes the Indemnifying
Partys liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such
claim or demand and (ii) if the Stockholders Representative does not dispute
such liability, whether or not the Stockholders Representative desires, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend against such
claim or demand, _provided_ that the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized
(but not obligated) prior to and during the Notice Period to file any motion,
answer or other pleading and to take such action which the Indemnified Party
shall reasonably deem necessary or appropriate to protect the Indemnified
Partys interests. In the event that the Stockholders Representative
notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that the Stockholders
Representative does not dispute the Indemnifying Partys obligation to
indemnify hereunder and desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such
claim or demand and except as hereinafter provided, the Stockholders
Representative shall have the right to defend (with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) by appropriate proceedings; 
_provided_ that, unless the Indemnified Party otherwise agrees in writing, the
Stockholders Representative may not settle any matter (in whole or in part)
unless such settlement includes a complete and unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party desires to participate in,
but not control, any such defense or settlement, the Indemnified Party may do
so at its sole cost and expense. If the Stockholders Representative elects
not to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand, whether by
not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice as provided above or otherwise,
then the Indemnified Party, without waiving any rights against the
Indemnifying Party, may settle or defend 



 

44 against any such claim in the Indemnified Partys sole discretion and, if it
is ultimately determined that the Indemnifying Party is responsible therefor
under this _Article 6_ , then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover from the Indemnifying Party the amount of any settlement or judgment
and all indemnifiable costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party with
respect thereto, including interest from the date such costs and expenses were
incurred at the fluctuating rate per annum equal to two percentage points in
excess of the prime rate published from time to time in the Eastern Edition
of _The Wall Street Journal_ (the " _Applicable Rate_ ") subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article 6._



(b) If at any time, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, notice
of which shall be given in writing to the Stockholders Representative, any
such claim or demand seeks material prospective relief which could have a
materially adverse effect on the business, operations, results of operations,
Assets, prospects or condition, financial and otherwise, of any
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to control or
assume (as the case may be) the defense of any such claim or demand and the
amount of any judgment or settlement and the reasonable costs and expenses of
defense shall be included as part of the indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the Indemnified Party should elect to
exercise such right, the Stockholders Representative shall have the right to
participate in, but not control, the defense of such claim or demand at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.



(c) In the event the Indemnified Party should have a claim against the
Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a claim or demand being
asserted against or sought to be collected by a third party, the Indemnified
Party shall with reasonable promptness send a Claim Notice with respect to
such claim to the Stockholders Representative. If the Stockholders
Representative does not notify the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period
that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the amount of such claim
shall be conclusively deemed a Liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.



(d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the Indemnified Party from
making a claim hereunder for potential or contingent claims or demands
provided the Claim Notice sets forth the specific basis for any such
potential or contingent claim or demand to the extent then feasible. The
Indemnified Partys failure to give reasonably prompt notice to the
Indemnifying Party of any actual, threatened or possible claim or demand
which may give rise to a right of indemnification hereunder shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any Liability which the Indemnifying Party may have
to the Indemnified Party unless the failure to give such notice materially
and adversely prejudices the Indemnifying Party. The procedures set forth in
this _Article 6_ shall not apply to claims or demands which in the reasonable
opinion of the Indemnified Party may be covered by the Threshold. 



6.03 _Withholding of Certain Payments_. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, in the event any Indemnified Party has made any claim
or claims for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, which claim or
claims have not been resolved or satisfied prior to the date any payments
from Verticalnet under the Merger Note would otherwise be payable,
Verticalnet shall withhold such payments on a dollar-for-dollar basis in an
amount equal to the aggregate dollar value of such claim or claims (or the
Indemnified Partys estimate thereof) until such time as such claim or claims
have been finally resolved.



6.04 _Exceptions to Limitations_. Except as set forth in _Section 6.07_ ,
nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict in any manner any rights
or remedies that any Party has, or might have, at law, in equity or
otherwise, against any other Party, based on any fraudulent action, willful
misrepresentation or willful breach of any warranty or representation.



 

45 6.05 _Effect of Investigation or Knowledge_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party
for indemnification shall not be adversely affected by any investigation by
or opportunity to investigate afforded to Acquiring Parties. Each Party shall
be deemed to be relying on the representations and warranties of the other
Party set forth herein regardless of any investigation or audit conducted
before or after the Closing Date or the decision of any Party to consummate
the Transactions.



6.06 _Payment of Indemnification Obligations; Set-Off Right_. In the event
that any Indemnifying Party is required to make any payment under this 
_Article 6_ , Verticalnet shall have the right to set-off such amount against
the amounts payable by Verticalnet under the Merger Note on a dollar-for-
dollar basis. Any amounts payable by Verticalnet under the Merger Note which
are set-off pursuant to this _Section 6.06_ shall be deemed cancelled and
shall no longer be due or payable by Verticalnet under the Merger Note.



6.07 _Stockholder Liability_. In the event that a Verticalnet Indemnified
Party seeks to satisfy any Losses and the set-off rights of Verticalnet under
_Section 6.06_ and the value of the Escrow Shares fail to fully satisfy the
amount of such Losses, such Verticalnet Indemnified Party may seek payment on
account of the unsatisfied amount of such Losses from each Stockholder in an
amount up to such Stockholders pro-rata share of such Losses based upon the
amount of Merger Consideration paid to such Stockholder. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, no Stockholder shall have liability
hereunder beyond such Stockholders pro-rata share of the Merger
Consideration.



6.08 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, from and after
the Effective Time, the rights and remedies of Verticalnet Indemnified Parties
under this _Article 6_ are the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of such
Verticalnet Indemnified Parties with respect to the matters set forth in
_Section 6.01_ , other than with respect to claims for fraud. VERTICALNET
HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES AND DISCHARGES, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF ALL
VERTICALNET INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, ALL RIGHTS TO, AND THE STOCKHOLDERS SHALL
NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION FOR, ALL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, AT
LAW OR IN EQUITY, FOR THE MATTERS SET FORTH IN SECTION 6.01, OTHER THAN THOSE
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR UNDER THIS _ARTICLE 6._

7.07 _Arbitration_. All disputes under this Agreement shall be settled by
arbitration in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a panel of three arbitrators
pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association. Arbitration may be commenced at any time by any of
Verticalnet, the Acquisition Sub, B2e, the Surviving Corporation or the
Stockholders Representative by giving written notice to each other party to a
dispute that such dispute has been referred to arbitration under this
_Section 7.07_. Each of the Acquiring Parties (or any single member thereof),
on the one hand, and the Stockholders Representative, on the other hand,
shall select one of the arbitrators within 15 days after the date of
the notice of arbitration described above; and each shall give the other
written notice of the name, and address of the arbitrator it selected. The two
arbitrators so selected shall jointly agree on the selection of the third
arbitrator, but if they do not so agree within 30 days after the date of the
notice of arbitration described above, the selection of the third arbitrator
shall be made pursuant to the rules from the panels of arbitrators maintained
by the American Arbitration Association. The third arbitrator may not have
had any past or present relationship with or interest in any of the Parties or
any of their respective Affiliates. Any award rendered by the arbitrators
shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such award shall be accompanied by a written opinion of
the arbitrators giving the reasons for the award. This provision for
arbitration shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and the decision
of the arbitrators in accordance herewith shall be final and binding and
there shall be no right of appeal therefrom. Judgment upon the award rendered
by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or
application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award
and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. In no event shall a demand
for arbitration be made by any party with respect to any dispute, claim or
other matter after the date on which litigation based on such dispute, claim
or other matter would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Each
party shall pay its own expenses of arbitration and the expenses of the
arbitrator selected by it, and the expenses of the third arbitrator shall be
equally shared; _provided_ , _however_ , that if in the opinion of the
arbitrators any claim for indemnification or any defense or objection thereto
was unreasonable, the arbitrator may assess, as part of his award, all or any
part of the arbitration expenses of the other party (including reasonable
attorneys fees) and of the arbitrator against the party raising such
unreasonable claim, defense or objection.



7.08 _Pennsylvania Law to Govern; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed, interpreted and enforced in
accordance with the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving
effect to any of the conflicts of laws provisions thereof that would require
the application of the substantive Laws of any other jurisdiction. EACH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.



7.09 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, the remainder hereof, and the application of such provision to
such Person or circumstance in any other jurisdiction or to other Persons or
circumstances in any jurisdiction, shall not be affected thereby, and to this
end the provisions of this Agreement shall be severable.



7.10 _No Benefit to Others_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement are for the sole benefit of the Parties
and, in the case of _Article 6_ , the other Verticalnet Indemnified Parties,
and their heirs, administrators, personal representatives, successors and
assigns, and they shall not be construed as conferring any rights on any
other Persons.



 

48 7.11 _Stockholders  Representative_. FBR Investment Management, Inc. shall
act as exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of the
Stockholders with respect to any and all matters, claims, controversies, or
disputes arising out of the terms of this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents and shall receive and hold the Merger Note on behalf of the
Stockholders and to take any action on behalf of the Stockholders thereunder
(the " _Stockholders  Representative_"). If more than one Person acts as the
Stockholders Representative, a decision of a majority of such Persons shall
be conclusive. In the event of the death, disability or resignation of a
Stockholders Representative, a successor may be appointed by a majority in
interest (based on the aggregate principal amount payable to the Stockholders
under the Merger Note) of the Stockholders. The Stockholders Representative
shall have the power to take any and all actions which the Stockholders
Representative believes are necessary or appropriate or in the best interests
of the Stockholders, as fully as if each such Stockholder was acting on its,
his or her own behalf with respect to the Merger Note and all claims for
indemnification under this Agreement and to take any action or no action in
connection therewith as the Stockholders Representative may deem appropriate
as effectively as the Stockholders could act themselves, including the
settlement or compromise of any dispute or controversy. The authority granted
hereunder is deemed to be coupled with an interest. The death or incapacity
of any Stockholder shall not terminate the authority and agency of the
Stockholders Representative. Verticalnet shall have the right to rely on any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders Representative as
being the act or omission of the Stockholders, without the need for any
inquiry, and any such actions or omissions shall be binding upon each of the
Stockholders. The Stockholders Representative shall incur no liability,
loss, damage or expense as a result of any action taken in good faith
hereunder, including any legal fees and expenses.



7.12 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
numbered sections corresponding to the Sections and subsections of
this Agreement to which they relate. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made
herein, unless such exception is identified specifically in the applicable
section of the Disclosure Schedule and shall be complete with cross
references where appropriate which, in such case, shall constitute the only
valid disclosure with respect to such Section(s) hereof.



7.13 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties hereby
acknowledge that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each of the Parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in any
court having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
such Party is entitled at law or in equity. In any action at law or suit in
equity to enforce this Agreement or the rights of any of the Parties
hereunder, the prevailing Party in such action or suit shall be entitled to
receive a reasonable sum for its attorneys fees and all other reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in such action or suit, if in such action or suit
the principal claim or defense of the non-prevailing Party is held to be
without merit because it was not reasonably supported by Laws or material
and relevant facts.
