AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of
March 27, 2011, by and among: EBAY INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent");
GIBRALTAR ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and GSI COMMERCE, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement
are defined in Exhibit A. 

  

Recitals 

   

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub
into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and the
DGCL. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and
the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. 

  

B. The board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has formed a
special committee of the Company Board (the "Special Committee") for the
purpose of, among other things, evaluating and making a recommendation to the
Company Board with respect to what actions should be taken regarding any
business combination, including with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger. 

  

C. The Company Board has, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the
Special Committee, and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, unanimously: (a) approved this Agreement and the Merger; (b)
determined that the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders; (c) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Merger; and (d) resolved to recommend that the Companys
stockholders adopt this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term
"unanimous" shall refer to the vote of all members of the Company Board, with
the exception of the two directors who have recused themselves from voting on
the Merger; 

  

D. The respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
this Agreement and the Merger. 

  

E. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause the Merger
to be consummated, certain stockholders of the Company are executing voting
and support agreements in favor of Parent concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (the "Support Agreements"). 

  

Agreement 

  

      
--- 
     

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

  
  

  

Section 1\. Description of Transaction

  

1.1. Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

1.2. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.3. Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP, 1950 University Avenue, Suite 500, East Palo
Alto, California, at 8:00 a.m. (California time) on a date to be designated
by Parent, which shall be no later than the fifth business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 (other than the conditions set forth
in Sections 6.4 and 7.3, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such
conditions). The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred
to as the "Closing Date." Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a
certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL
shall be duly executed by the Company in connection with the Closing and,
concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become
effective at the time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may
be specified in such certificate of merger with the consent of Parent (the
time as of which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the
"Effective Time"). 

  

1.4. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time: 

  

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in its entirety pursuant to the Merger at the Effective Time or
immediately thereafter to conform to the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "GSI COMMERCE, INC."; 

  

(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at
the Effective Time or immediately thereafter to conform to the Bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and 

  

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

1.5. Conversion of Shares. 

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company: 

   

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) (together
with any associated Rights, as defined in Section 2.3(c)) immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; 

   

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time (together with any associated Rights) shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor; 

   

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this Section 1.5(a)
and subject to Sections 1.5(b), 1.5(c), 1.7 and 1.8, each share of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together
with any associated Rights) shall be converted into the right to receive
$29.25 in cash (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"), without interest;
and 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

(b) If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending
at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are
changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during
such period, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur
during such period, then the consideration to be delivered in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) shall
be adjusted to the extent appropriate. 

  

(c) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other Contract with the Company or under which the Company has
any rights, then (except to the extent provided in any binding agreement
between the Company and the holder thereof and except to the extent Parent
otherwise elects), the Merger Consideration delivered in exchange for such
shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition and need not be paid
until such time as such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition lapses or otherwise terminates (whether under the Company award
agreement or Company Employee Agreement). The Company shall take all action
that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set
forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract. 

  

1.6. Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further
transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such
stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Stock
Certificate") is presented to the Paying Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or
to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall
be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7. 

   

1.7. Exchange of Certificates. 

  

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the "Paying Agent").
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with
the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payments of the cash consideration
payable pursuant to Section 1.5 (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall
be invested by the Payment Agent as directed by Parent. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will mail to the
Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates immediately
prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a
provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Paying
Agent or, in the case of Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures
set forth in the letter of transmittal); and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares
in exchange for Merger Consideration. Exchange of any Book Entry Shares shall
be effected in accordance with the Paying Agents customary procedures with
respect to securities represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Company
Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share to the Paying Agent for exchange,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or Parent: (A) the holder
of such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the cash consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5, in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate; and (B) the Company
Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock which
are not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the holder in whose name the
Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share formerly representing such
shares is registered if (1) any such Company Stock Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (2) such
holder shall have paid any fiduciary or surety bonds and any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger
Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such bonds and Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable). Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right
to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.5. If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent
or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the delivery of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock
Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond
(in such sum as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct) as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 1.7. 

  

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates as of the date that is 180 days after the date on
which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand,
and any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have
not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration. 

  

(d) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Common Stock or a Company Equity Award such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other
applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid. 

  

(e) If any Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share has not been
surrendered by the earlier of: (i) the fifth anniversary of the date on which
the Merger becomes effective; or (ii) the date immediately prior to the date
on which the cash amount that such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry
Share represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Body, then such cash amount shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(f) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other
Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or
similar Legal Requirement. 

   

1.8. Dissenting Shares. 

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a proper demand
for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with all applicable
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as
"Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5, but
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder
of Dissenting Shares. 

  

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then such shares shall be deemed automatically to
have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and to represent only,
the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate
representing such shares. 

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demand for
appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
DGCL, any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument. The Company shall not voluntarily make any payment or
settlement offer or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of such
demands prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice
or instrument unless Parent shall have given its prior written consent to such
payment, settlement offer, settlement or withdrawal. 

  

1.9. Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary

Acquired Corporations and Company Affiliates has performed in all respects
all obligations required to be performed by it under each Company Employee
Plan, and each Company Employee Plan has been established and maintained
in accordance with its terms and with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code and other Legal Requirements. To the Knowledge of the Company, any

the most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such Company
Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to materially affect any such

Legal Requirements is, to the Knowledge of the Company, so tax qualified, and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and no circumstance or
condition exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the
disqualification of any such Company Employee Plan. Except for such matters
that would not have and would not reasonably be expected to have or result in

Plan in which stock of any of the Acquired Corporations or any Company
Affiliate is or was held as a plan asset. Except as would not have and would

Effect, the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or

contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide in full for the accrued
benefit obligations, with respect to all current and former participants in
such Foreign Plan according to the reasonable actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to
and obligations under such Foreign Plan, and the Merger will not cause any
such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit

that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code. No

site of employment or facility of any of the Acquired Corporations. Since

of the Company has (or is expected to have) a material equity interest in, or
is expected to participate in the Acquisition Transaction proposed by, such
Excluded Party; and (B) the material terms and conditions of the pending
Acquisition Proposal made by such Excluded Party (it being understood that
price per share shall be considered a material term of any such pending
Acquisition Proposal); and (ii) the Company shall deliver to Parent copies of
all proposed definitive documents received by the Company or any of its
Representatives from any such Excluded Party or its Representatives relating
to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

(d) Immediately upon the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, except as provided

propose to), directly or indirectly, and shall cause the Acquired
Corporations and the directors and executive officers of the Company not to
(and not to resolve or publicly propose to), directly or indirectly, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the other
Representatives of any of the Acquired Corporations do not (and do not
resolve or publicly propose to) directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, encourage, assist, induce or facilitate the submission, announcement
or making of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry by any Person
(other than a Person that is then an Excluded Party), or take any action that
could reasonably be expected to lead a Person (other than a Person that is
then an Excluded Party) to disclose, announce, commence, submit or
otherwise make an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (ii) furnish

regarding any of the Acquired Corporations to any Person (other than a Person
that is then an Excluded Party) in connection with or in response to an
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; or (iii) engage in discussions
or negotiations with any Person (other than a Person that is then an Excluded
Party) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry;
_provided, however,_ that, subject to Section 4.3(e) and the other provisions
of this Agreement, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the Company may, without being deemed to violate this
Section 4.3(d), furnish non-public information regarding the Acquired
Corporations to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, any
Person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal
that is submitted to the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn), but only
if: (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach in any
material respect of this Agreement; (B) the Company Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee, reasonably determines in good faith,
after having taken into account the advice of an independent financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the advice of the Companys
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Offer; and (C) prior to furnishing
any such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, the Company receives from such Person an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

(e) Prior to furnishing or otherwise permitting the transmittal of any non-
public information to any Excluded Party or other Person pursuant to Section
4.3(a) or the proviso to Section 4.3(d), the Company shall (as a condition to
furnishing or otherwise permitting the transmittal of such non-public
information to such Person) furnish such non-public information to Parent (to
the extent such non-public information has not been previously furnished or
Made Available by the Company to Parent). 

  

(f) If the Company, any other Acquired Corporation or any Representative of
any Acquired Corporation receives (from an Excluded Party or from any other
Person) an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or any request for
non-public information at any time following the expiration of the Go-Shop
Period, then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request)
advise Parent in writing of such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or
request and the material terms and conditions thereof (excluding the identity
of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition
Inquiry or request). Following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period: (i) the
Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt)
provide Parent with redacted copies of all proposed definitive documents
received by the Company or any of its Representatives from any such Person or
its Representatives relating to any Acquisition Proposal; and (ii)
the Company shall keep Parent fully informed with respect to the status of
any such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request and any
modification or proposed modification thereto, and shall promptly (and in no
event later than 24 hours after obtaining knowledge thereof) notify Parent of
any material change or development with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal. 

  

(g) The Company: (i) agrees that it will not, and shall ensure that each other
Acquired Corporation will not, at any time (whether during or after the Go-
Shop Period), release or permit the release of any Person from, or amend,
waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any provision of, any "standstill"
or similar agreement or provision to which any of the Acquired Corporations
is or becomes a party or under which any of the Acquired Corporations has or
acquires any rights; and (ii) will use its best efforts to enforce or cause
to be enforced each such agreement or provision at the request of Parent;
_provided, however_ , that the Company may waive its rights under any
such "standstill" or similar agreement or provision to the extent necessary
to enable the parties subject thereto to make Acquisition Proposals to the
Company during the Go Shop Period.

5.1. Proxy Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto (and to review and comment on any comments
of the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any amendments or
supplements thereto), and shall reasonably consider all comments made by
Parent, prior to the filing thereof. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to comply in
all material respects with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
and other applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall promptly provide

practicable after the earlier of: (i) receiving notification that the SEC or
its staff is not reviewing the Proxy Statement; or (ii) receiving notification
of final resolution of any comments received from the SEC or its staff
concerning the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders, prior to the later of
(A) the termination of the Go-Shop Period or (B) the time as of which no
Acquisition Proposal from an Excluded Party is pending which constitutes, or
is reasonably likely to constitute, a Superior Offer. If any event relating
to any of the Acquired Corporations occurs, or if the Company becomes aware
of any information, that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, then the Company shall promptly inform Parent thereof
and shall promptly file such amendment or supplement with the SEC and, if
appropriate, mail such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the
Company. 

   

5.2. Company Stockholders Meeting. 

  

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal
Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of
Company Common Stock (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Company Stockholders
Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company and Parent)
as promptly as practicable after the commencement of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be required to call, give notice of or hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting prior to the termination of the Go-Shop Period. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited
in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

(b) Subject to Section 5.2(d), the Proxy Statement shall include a statement
to the effect that: (i) each of the Special Committee and the Company Board:
(i) has unanimously determined and believes that the Merger is advisable and
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and
(ii) unanimously recommends that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt
this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting; and (B) the Company
Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, has
unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement and unanimously approved the
Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL. (The
unanimous determination by the Special Committee and the Company Board that
the Merger is advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders and the unanimous recommendation of the Special
Committee and the Company Board that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt
this Agreement are collectively referred to as the "Company Board
Recommendation.") The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement includes
the opinion of the financial advisor referred to in Section 2.24. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (i) except as
provided in Section 5.2(d), withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent
or Merger Sub, or permit the withdrawal or modification in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub of, the Company Board Recommendation (it being
understood and agreed that the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed
to have been modified by the Company Board or any committee thereof in a
manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub if the Company Board Recommendation
shall no longer be unanimous); (ii) recommend the approval, acceptance or
adoption of, or approve, endorse, accept or adopt, any Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) approve or recommend, or cause or permit any Acquired Corporation
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
document or Contract constituting or relating directly or indirectly to, or
that contemplates or is intended or could reasonably be expected to result
directly or indirectly in, an Acquisition Transaction, other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant to Section 4.3(a)
or Section 4.3(d); or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to, or permit
any Acquired Corporation or any Representative of any Acquired Corporation
to agree or publicly propose to, take any of the actions referred to in this
Section 5.2(c). 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clause "(i)" of
Section 5.2(c), at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may withdraw or modify the
Company Board Recommendation: 

   

(i) if: (A) a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company
and is not withdrawn; (B) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
breach in a material respect of this Agreement; (C) the Company Board, acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, reasonably determines in
good faith, after having taken into account the advice of an independent
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the advice of the
Companys outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Offer and that, in light of such Superior Offer, the Company Board
is required to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in order
for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law; and (D) no less than 24
hours prior to withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation, the
Company Board delivers to Parent a written notice: (1) stating that
the Company has received a Superior Offer that did not result from a breach
in a material respect of this Agreement; (2) stating that the Company Board
intends to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation as a result of
such Superior Offer and describing any intended modification of the Company
Board Recommendation; (3) specifying the identity of the party submitting a
Superior Offer and the terms and conditions of such Superior Offer; and (4)
attaching copies of the most current and complete draft of any Contract
relating to such Superior Offer; or 

   

(ii) if: (A) there shall arise after the date of this Agreement any change
in circumstances affecting the Acquired Corporations that does not relate to
any Acquisition Proposal and that leads the Company Board to consider
withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation (any such change in
circumstances unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal being referred to as a
"Change in Circumstances"); (B) the Company provides Parent, at least 72
hours prior to any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board
will consider and determine whether such Change in Circumstances requires the
Company Board to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, with a
written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for
holding such meeting and a reasonably detailed description of such Change in
Circumstances; (C) the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee, reasonably determines in good faith, after having taken
into account the advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and the advice of 

 

    ##### 

  

   

the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Change in
Circumstances, the withdrawal or modification of the Company Board
Recommendation is required in order for the Company Board to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware
law; (D) no less than 72 hours prior to withdrawing or modifying the Company
Board Recommendation, the Company Board delivers to Parent a written notice:
(1) stating that a Change in Circumstances has arisen; (2) stating that it
intends to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in light of
such Change in Circumstances and describing any intended modification of the
Company Board Recommendation; and (3) containing a reasonably detailed
description of such Change in Circumstances; (E) throughout the
period between the delivery of such notice and any withdrawal or modification
of the Company Board Recommendation, the Company engages (to the extent
requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that no withdrawal or modification of the Company
Board Recommendation would be legally required as a result of such Change in
Circumstances; and (F) at the time of withdrawing or modifying the
Company Board Recommendation, the failure to withdraw or modify the Company
Board Recommendation would constitute a breach of the fiduciary obligations
of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware
law in light of such Change in Circumstances (after taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the
negotiations required by clause "(D)" above or otherwise). 

  

(e) The Company shall ensure that any withdrawal or modification of the
Company Board Recommendation: (i) does not change or otherwise affect the
approval of this Agreement by the Company Board or any other approval of the
Company Board; and (ii) does not have the effect of causing any corporate
takeover statute or other similar statute (including any
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or "fair
price" statute) of the State of Delaware or any other state to be applicable
to this Agreement, any of the Support Agreements or the Merger. 

   

5.3. Company Equity Awards. 

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Option
and Company RSU that is vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including all Options and Company RSUs that vest
contingent on the Merger or upon termination of service at or immediately
prior to the Effective Time) (each, an "Outstanding Vested Company Award") to
be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon
the cancellation thereof the holder of each such Outstanding Vested Company
Award shall be granted the right to receive, in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Outstanding Vested Company
Award immediately prior to such cancellation, an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to: (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration; _minus_ (ii) with respect to a Company Option, the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (it
being understood that, if the exercise price payable in respect of a share of
Company Common Stock subject to any such Company Option equals or exceeds the
Per Share Merger Consideration, then the amount payable under this Section
5.3(a) with respect to such Company Option shall be zero). Each holder of an
Outstanding Vested Company Award cancelled as provided in this Section 5.3(a)
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the cash consideration (if any) specified in this Section 5.3(a),
without interest. Parent shall cause the cash payments described in this
Section 5.3(a) to be paid promptly following the Effective Time. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "Outstanding
Unvested Company Option"), shall be converted into and become an option to
purchase Parent Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent:
(i) assuming such Outstanding Unvested Company Option; or (ii) replacing
such Outstanding Unvested Company Option by issuing a reasonably equivalent
replacement stock option to purchase Parent Common Stock in substitution
therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan and the terms
of the stock option agreement or an applicable Company Employee Agreement by
which such Outstanding Unvested Company Option is evidenced. All rights with
respect to Company Common Stock under Outstanding Unvested Company Options
assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon be converted into options with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective
Time: (A) each Outstanding Unvested Company Option assumed or replaced by
Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Outstanding Unvested
Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to
such Outstanding Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and rounding the resulting
number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (C)
the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of each Outstanding Unvested Company Option assumed or replaced
by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of
Company Common Stock subject to such Outstanding Unvested Company Option, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio,
and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and
(D) subject to the terms of the stock option agreement by which such
Outstanding Unvested Company Option is evidenced or an applicable Company
Employee Agreement, any restriction on the exercise of any Outstanding
Unvested Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall continue in full
force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other
provisions of such Outstanding Unvested Company Option shall otherwise remain
unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of such Outstanding
Unvested Company Option; _provided, however_ , that Parents board
of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to
each Outstanding Unvested Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent. The
"Conversion Ratio" shall be equal to the fraction having a numerator equal to
the Per Share Merger Consideration and having a denominator equal to the
average of the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as
reported on NASDAQ for each of the 10 consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the "Average Parent Stock Price");
_provided, however_ , that if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason
of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, or a record date with respect
to any such event shall occur during such period, then the Conversion Ratio
shall be adjusted accordingly. 

  

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become a
right to be issued Parent Common Stock, with such conversion effected through
Parent, at Parents option, either: (i) assuming such Company RSU; or (ii)
replacing such Company RSU by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement
right to be issued Parent Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either
case in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan and the terms of the award
agreement or an applicable Company Employee Agreement by which such Company
RSU is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under
Company RSUs assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon be converted into
rights to be issued Parent Common Stock upon settlement of such assumed or
replaced Company RSUs. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A)
each Company RSU assumed or replaced by Parent will represent a right to be
issued solely shares of Parent Common Stock upon settlement thereof; (B) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company RSU assumed
or replaced by Parent shall be determined by _multiplying_ the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company RSU
immediately prior to the

  

    ##### 

  

   

Effective Time _by_ the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting number
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (C)
subject to the terms of the award agreement by which such Company RSU is
evidenced or an applicable Company Employee Agreement, any restriction on the
issuance of shares under any Company RSU assumed or replaced by Parent shall
continue in full force and effect and the term, vesting schedule and
other provisions of such Company RSU shall otherwise remain unchanged as a
result of the assumption or replacement of such Company RSU; _provided,
however,_ that Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall
succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any
committee thereof with respect to each Company RSU assumed or replaced by
Parent. 

  

(d) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than 15 business days after the
Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the assumed and replaced
Outstanding Unvested Company Options and outstanding unvested Company RSUs,
in each case to the extent that such shares of Parent Common Stock can be
registered on a Form S-8. 

  

(e) At the Effective Time, if Parent so elects, Parent may assume any or all
of the Company Equity Plans or merge any such Company Equity Plan into any
equity incentive plan of Parent. If Parent elects to so assume or merge any
Company Equity Plan, then, under such Company Equity Plan, Parent shall be
entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable
Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of such Company Equity Plan as
of the Effective Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves
as a result of the termination of Outstanding Unvested Company Options that
are assumed or replaced by Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(b)), except that:
(i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii)
all references in such Company Equity Plan to a number of shares of Company
Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares
of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of referenced
shares of Company Common Stock by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the
resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock; and (iii) Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall
succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any
committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Company
Equity Plan. 

  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 5.3 and to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, holders of Company Equity Awards have no rights with respect
thereto other than those specifically provided in this Section 5.3. 

   

5.4. Employee Benefits. 

  

(a) If Parent elects not to maintain the Surviving Corporations health,
vacation or 401(k) plans after the Effective Time, then, subject to any
necessary transition period and subject to any applicable Parent plan
provisions, contractual requirements or Legal Requirements: (i) all employees
of the Acquired Corporations who continue employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after
the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to participate
in Parents health, vacation and 401(k) plans, to substantially the same
extent as similarly situated employees of Parent; and (ii) for purposes
of determining a Continuing Employees eligibility to participate in such
plans (other than any sabbatical program), such Continuing Employee shall
receive credit under such plans (other than any sabbatical program) for his
or her years of continuous service with the Acquired Corporations prior to
the Effective Time. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and perform its
obligations under the terms of any Company Employee Agreement providing
change in control benefits. Nothing in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Company Associate to
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of
Parent. Except for Indemnified Persons to the extent of their rights pursuant
to Section 5.5, no Company Associate, and no Continuing Employee, shall be
deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 5.4(b) shall limit the effect of Section 9.8. 

  

(c) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least two business days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all
actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the
day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company
Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify
under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"). If the Company is
required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide
to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the
Company Board of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company
401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which shall be subject to the prior
review and approval of Parent). The Company also shall take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may
reasonably request. 

  

(d) Parent agrees to take all actions reasonably required to provide that its
employee pension benefit plan that is intended to include a Section 401(k) of
the Code arrangement shall accept rollovers from each Company 401(k) Plan,
including with respect to plan loans which are outstanding at the Closing
Date. If Parent seeks a favorable determination letter from the IRS in
connection with the termination of the each Company 401(k) Plan, Parent
agrees to permit hardship distributions in accordance with the terms of each
Company 401(k) Plan between the date of such plan termination and the date
distributions of assets from the trust of any Company 401(k) Plan. 

  

(e) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are
imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the Merger, the
Company and Parent shall consult to ensure that such notification or
consultation requirements are complied with prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall consult and cooperate with
Parent regarding, provide Parent with the opportunity to review and comment
on, and reasonably consider all comments made by Parent on, communications
with Continuing Employees regarding post-Closing employment matters,
including post-Closing employee benefits and compensation. 

   

5.5. Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

  

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in favor of those
Persons who are directors and officers of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Persons") for their acts and omissions as
directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time as provided (i)
by applicable Legal Requirements, (ii) in the Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) or
(iii) in any indemnification agreements between the Company and said
Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement), shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of six years from the date on which the Merger becomes effective. 

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent (or, at Parents option, the Company)
shall purchase a prepaid, non-cancellable "tail" policy on the existing
policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company as of the date of this Agreement ("DandO Insurance") for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from the Effective
Time and otherwise on terms and conditions that are no less favorable than as
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement. 

  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5. 

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 5.5 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware law or any other applicable Legal Requirement or under any agreement
of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These
rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. 

   

5.6. Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters. 

  

(a) Each party shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other
documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with
respect to the Merger, and to submit promptly any additional information
requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall prepare and file: (i) the
notification and report forms required to be filed under the HSR Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable; and (ii) any notification or other
document required to be filed in connection with the Merger under
any applicable foreign Legal Requirement relating to antitrust or competition
matters. The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to: (A) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") or the Department of Justice (the "DOJ")
for additional information or documentation; and (B) any inquiries or
requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust or
competition authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust
or competition matters. 

  

(b) Subject to Section 5.6(c), Parent and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or
advisable to consummate the Merger as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject
to Section 5.6(c), each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings
(if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such
party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger; (ii) shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be
obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or
otherwise) by such party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger; and (iii) shall use reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint,
injunction or other legal bar to the Merger. Each of the parties hereto shall
