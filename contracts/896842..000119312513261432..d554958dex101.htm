1.6 _Assumption/Rejection of Certain Contracts_.

 

(a) _Assignment and Assumption at Closing_.

(i) _Schedule 1.6(a)_ sets forth a list of all executory Contracts (including
all leases with respect to Leased Real Property) to which, to the Sellers
Knowledge, one or more of the Sellers are party and which are to be included
in the Assigned Contracts. From and after the date hereof until two (2)
Business Days prior to Closing, the Sellers shall make such deletions to
_Schedule 1.6(a)_ as Purchaser shall, in its sole discretion, request in
writing. Any such deleted Contract shall be deemed to no longer be an Assigned
Contract. All Contracts of Sellers that are not listed on _Schedule 1.6(a)_
shall not be considered an Assigned Contract or Purchased Asset and shall be
deemed " _Rejected Contracts_."

 



8 (ii) Sellers shall take all actions required to assume and assign
the Assigned Contracts to Purchaser (other than payment of Cure Costs, if so
required), including taking all actions required to facilitate any
negotiations with the counterparties to such Assigned Contracts and to obtain
an Order containing a finding that the proposed assumption and assignment of
the Assigned Contracts to Purchaser satisfies all applicable requirements of
Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

(iii) At Closing, (x) Sellers shall, pursuant to the Sale Order and the
Assumption and Assignment Agreement or the Assumption and Assignment of
Leases, as applicable, assume and assign to Purchaser (the consideration for
which is included in the Purchase Price) each of the Assigned Contracts that
is capable of being assumed and assigned, and (y) Purchaser shall pay
promptly all Cure Costs (if any) in connection with such assumption and
assignment (as agreed to among the various counterparties, Purchaser and
Sellers, or as determined by the Bankruptcy Court) and assume and perform and
discharge the Assumed Liabilities (if any) under the Assigned Contracts,
pursuant to the Assumption and Assignment Agreement or the Assumption and
Assignment of Leases, as applicable.

(b) _Previously Omitted Contracts_.

(i) If prior to or following Closing, it is discovered that a Contract should
have been listed on _Schedule 1.6(a)_ but was not listed on _Schedule 1.6(a)_
, or if Purchaser desires in its sole discretion to acquire any Contract to
which one or more of the Sellers are party (including any Rejected Contract
prior to the entry by the Bankruptcy Court of an order with respect thereto)
(any such Contract, a " _Previously Omitted Contract_ "), Sellers shall,
promptly following the discovery thereof or receipt of notice from Purchaser
of its desire to acquire any such Contract (but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days following the discovery thereof or receipt of such notice),
notify Purchaser in writing of such Previously Omitted Contract and all Cure
Costs (if any) for such Previously Omitted Contract. Purchaser shall
thereafter deliver written notice to Sellers, no later than five (5) Business
Days following notification of such Previously Omitted Contract from Sellers,
designating such Previously Omitted Contract as "Assumed" or "Rejected" (a "
_Previously Omitted Contract Designation_ "). A Previously Omitted Contract
designated in accordance with this _Section 1.6(b)(i)_ as "Rejected," or
with respect to which Purchaser fails to timely deliver a Previously Omitted
Contract Designation, shall be a Rejected Contract.

 

(ii) If Purchaser designates a Previously Omitted Contract as "Assumed" in
accordance with  _Section 1.6(b)(i)_, (i) _Schedule 1.6(a)_ shall be
amended to include such Previously Omitted Contract and (ii) Sellers shall
serve a notice (the " _Previously Omitted Contract Notice_ ") on
the counterparties to such Previously Omitted Contract notifying such
counterparties of the Cure Costs with respect to such Previously Omitted
Contract and Sellers intention to assume and assign such Previously Omitted
Contract in accordance with this _Section 1.6_. The Previously Omitted
Contract Notice shall provide the counterparties to such Previously Omitted
Contract with fifteen (15) Business Days to object, in writing to the Sellers
and Purchaser, to the Cure Costs or the assumption of its Contract. If the
counterparties, Sellers and Purchaser are unable to reach a consensual
resolution with respect to the objection, the Sellers will seek an expedited
hearing before Bankruptcy Court to determine the Cure Costs and approve the
assumption. If no objection is timely served on the Sellers and Purchaser,
Sellers shall obtain an order of the Bankruptcy Court fixing the Cure Costs
and approving the assumption of the Previously Omitted Contract.

 



9 ARTICLE II.

CONSIDERATION

2.1 Consideration.

 

(a) The aggregate consideration (collectively, the " _Purchase Price_ ") to be
paid for the purchase of the Purchased Assets, and subject to adjustment in
accordance with _Section 2.2_ below, shall be: (i) the assumption of Assumed
Liabilities and (ii) a cash payment of $205,000,000 (the " _Cash Payment_ ").

 

(b) On the Closing Date the Purchaser shall deliver the Cash Payment less the
Deposit (the " _Closing Date Payment_ ") and any payment required to be made
pursuant to any other provision hereof in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such bank account as shall be designated in writing by the
Company.

 

2.2 _Working Capital; Adjustment to Purchase Price_.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Purchaser a working capital statement (the _"Estimated
Working Capital Statement"_ ), setting forth the Companys calculation of
Closing Working Capital with respect to the Business as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date ( _"Estimated Working Capital"_ ). For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Closing Working Capital_ " shall mean the amount by
which (i) Current Assets exceed (ii) Current Liabilities. Closing Working
Capital will exclude any and all inter-company receivables, payables or other
balances between the Company or any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the
Company or any Subsidiary, on the other hand. To the extent Current
Liabilities exceed Current Assets, Estimated Working Capital shall be stated
as a negative number. The term  _"Current Assets"_ means the receivables,
owned inventory, prepaid inventory and Specified Prepaid Expenses included in
the Purchased Assets. The term " _Specified Prepaid Expenses_ " means
prepaid royalties, fees or other payments treated under GAAP as a prepaid
expense of the Business as of the Closing under the Assigned Contracts
specified on _Schedule 1.6(a_ ) to the extent such Seller Contracts are
included in the Purchased Assets. The term _"Current Liabilities"_ means the
total closing trade payables included in the Assumed Liabilities. The
Estimated Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used to
prepare the Unaudited Financial Statements and, to the extent consistent with
the foregoing, in accordance with GAAP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) any
assets of the Company or a Subsidiary that are not part of the Purchased
Assets shall not under any circumstances be deemed a Current Asset and (B) any
Liabilities of the Company or a Subsidiary that are not part of the Assumed
Liabilities shall not under any circumstances be deemed a Current Liability.

(b) Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
deliver to the Company a working capital statement (the _"Working Capital
Statement"_ ), setting forth Purchasers calculation of Closing Working
Capital with respect to the Business as of the opening of business on the
Closing Date. The Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies
used to prepare the Unaudited Financial Statements and, to the extent
consistent with the foregoing, in accordance with GAAP. The Company shall
cause its employees to assist Purchaser and its representatives in the
preparation of the Working Capital Statement and shall provide Purchaser and
its representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of
the Company and its Seller Subsidiaries for such purpose.

 



10 (c) If Final Working Capital (as defined in _Section 2.3_ below) exceeds
Estimated Working Capital, then Purchaser shall pay to the Company an amount
equal to the difference between Final Working Capital and Estimated Working
Capital. If Estimated Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, then the
Company shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the difference between
Estimated Working Capital and Final Working Capital. Any payment required to
be made pursuant to this _Section 2.2(c)_ shall be made within five (5)
Business Days after the Companys acceptance of the Working Capital Statement
or, if applicable, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of a
determination and resolution of any dispute over the Working Capital Statement
as provided in _Section 2.3_ below. Any such amount payable by Purchaser
pursuant to this _Section 2.2(c)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (in U.S. Dollars) to an account or accounts
designated in writing by the Party entitled to receive such payment (or by
such other means as are mutually agreeable to the Parties).

2.3 _Disputes Concerning Adjustment_. 

(a) If the Company does not deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser within ten
(10) Business Days of receiving the Working Capital Statement, the Company
shall be deemed to have agreed with the Working Capital Statement presented by
Purchaser and the Closing Working Capital set forth on the Working Closing
Statement shall be deemed the _"Final Working Capital"_ for purposes of this
Agreement. _"Final Working Capital"_ shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in _Section 2.3(b)_ below.

 

(b) If the Company delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser within ten (10)
Business Days of receiving the Working Capital Statement, then the Company
and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If, after
twenty (20) days from the date a Dispute Notice is given hereunder, the
Company and Purchaser cannot agree on the resolution of the dispute, then the
Arbitrating Accountant shall be jointly engaged to arbitrate the dispute.
Within twenty (20) days after the Arbitrating Accountant accepts the
engagement, as evidenced by an engagement letter signed by the Arbitrating
Accountant and the Parties (the date of such acceptance being referred to
herein as the _"Engagement Date"_ ), Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall prepare and submit to the Arbitrating
Accountant a written brief stating their respective positions on the disputed
issue(s). Such briefs shall be submitted simultaneously by the Parties. Within
ten (10) days thereafter, Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall prepare and submit to the Arbitrating Accountant a reply
brief to the brief submitted by the other Party or Parties, as applicable.
Such reply briefs shall be submitted simultaneously. Within forty (40) days
after the Engagement Date, the Arbitrating Accountant shall determine whether
disputed issues of material fact exist between the Parties and, if such
determination is made, shall require that an evidentiary hearing be held and
completed not later than the fifty-fifth (55th) day after the Engagement
Date. The Arbitrating Accountant shall render its final decision and award
regarding the disputed matters not later than the fifth (5th) day after the
evidentiary hearing is held or, if no evidentiary hearing is to be held, not
later than the fifty-fifth (55th) day after the Engagement Date. When acting
pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_, the Arbitrating Accountant shall determine
whether and to what extent, if any, Purchasers calculation of the Closing
Working Capital (determined based on the Working Capital Statement) requires
adjustment. The Arbitrating Accountant shall address only those issues in
dispute, and may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by a Party or less than the smallest value for
such item claimed by a Party. In addition, the Arbitrating Accountant shall
apportion its fees and expenses between the Company, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, in proportion to the difference between the
relative position of each Party and the Arbitrating Accountants ultimate
determination with respect to the amount of the Closing Working Capital.
Absent fraud or self-dealing, the decision and award of the Arbitrating
Accountant, including the apportionment of its fees, shall be final and
binding on the Parties and shall be subject to confirmation and entry of
judgment in accordance with applicable Law. In no event shall the
Arbitrating 

 



11  Accountant award either Party consequential, incidental or punitive damages.
Purchaser and the Company shall make all books, records and work papers
reasonably requested by the Arbitrating Accountant in connection with the
resolution of the item(s) disputed hereunder available to the Arbitrating
Accountant. The Closing Working Capital as determined pursuant to the terms of
this _Section 2.3(b)_ shall be deemed the  _"Final Working Capital"_ for
purposes of this Agreement.

2.4 _Deposit_. No later than three Business Days following the entry of the
Bidding Procedures Order, Purchaser will make an earnest money deposit (the "
_Deposit_ ") in the amount of $15 million to the Escrow Agent. The Deposit
shall be applied against payment of the Purchaser Price on the Closing Date.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by any Party hereto pursuant to
_Sections 3.4(a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_ ,  _(g)_ or _(i)_
hereof, or in the event that a party other than Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser purchases all or a significant portion of the Purchased Assets, then
the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser within five (5) Business Days
after Seller receipt of Purchasers written request therefore, except in the
case of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 3.4 (h)_ hereof,
in which case Seller shall return the Deposit to Purchaser upon the closing
of the Alternative Transaction. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Sections 3.4 (i)_ , _(j),_ or _(k)_ hereof or otherwise
by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under _Section 9.2_
hereof resulting primarily from Purchaser breaching any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein, then Seller shall retain the Deposit.
The Parties agree that the Company right to retain the Deposit, as set forth
herein, is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Sellers for their respective efforts and
resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

ARTICLE IV.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS

Subject to the exceptions noted in the schedules delivered by the Sellers

its properties and to carry on its business (including the Business) as it is
now being conducted, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Seller
has previously delivered to Purchaser complete and correct copies of its
Organizational Documents, as amended and in effect on the Agreement Date. Each
Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of the Business or the nature of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such
failures to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.2 _Authorization of Agreement_. Subject to the entry of the Sale Order,
each Seller has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party, to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party,
the performance by each Seller of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each
Seller. This Agreement has been, and at or prior to the Closing, each of the
Ancillary Documents to which it is a party will be, duly and validly executed
and delivered by each Seller and (assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the other Parties, and the entry of the Sale Order) this
Agreement constitutes, and each Ancillary Document to which it is a party
when so executed and delivered (assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties thereto) will constitute, legal, valid and
binding obligations of each Seller, enforceable against each Seller in
accordance with its terms. Subject to entry of the Sale Order, except (a) as
required to comply with the HSR Act, (b) for entry of the Sale Order, (c) for
notices, filings and consents required in connection with the Bankruptcy Cases
and (d) for the notices, filings and consents set forth on _Schedule 4.2_ ,
Sellers are not required to give any notice to, make any registration,
declaration or filing with or obtain any consent, waiver or approval from, any
Person (including any Governmental Body) in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents or the
consummation or performance of any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, other than such notices, registrations, declarations, filings,
consents, waivers, or approvals, the failure of which to make or obtain would
not have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.3 _Conflicts; Consents; Compliance with Law_.

(a) Except as set forth on  _Schedule 4.3(a)_ , the execution, delivery and
performance by each Seller of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document to
which it is a party, the compliance by Sellers with any of the provisions
hereof or thereof, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby and the taking by Sellers of any other action contemplated hereby
or thereby, do not and will not contravene, violate or conflict with any term
or provision of its respective Organizational Documents. 

(b) Except (i) for the entry of the Sale Order, (ii) for filings as may be
required under the HSR Act, and (iii) as set forth on _Schedule 4.3(b)_ , no
filing with, notice to or consent from any Person is required in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance by each Seller Subsidiary of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party, the compliance
by Seller with any of the provisions hereof or thereof, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or the taking by any Seller
of any other action contemplated hereby or thereby, other than such filings,
notices or consents, the failure of which to make or obtain would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Each Seller is in compliance, in all material respects with all
applicable Laws. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3(c),_ neither Seller nor
any Subsidiary has received any outstanding

 



17  written notice from any Governmental Body regarding any actual or possible
material violation of, or failure to comply in any material respect with, any
Law. No Seller is in default in any material respect of any order, writ,
injunction, judgment or decree applicable to the Business or the Purchased
Assets.

4.4  _Brokers and Finders_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.4_ , no Person
has acted, directly or indirectly, as a broker, finder or financial advisor
for Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and Purchaser is not or will not become obligated to pay any fee or
commission or like payment to any broker, finder or financial advisor as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon any arrangement made by or on behalf of Sellers.

4.5 _Title to Purchased Assets_. Other than the Leased Real Property and the
personal property subject to the Personal Property Leases and except for
Permitted Encumbrances, Sellers have good title to the Purchased Assets and,
at the Closing, Purchaser, pursuant to the Sale Order, shall acquire good and
marketable title in, and under all of such Purchased Assets, in each case
free and clear of all Liens to the fullest extent permissible under Section
363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Purchased Assets include all of the
properties and assets required to operate, in all material respects, the
Business in the Ordinary Course of Business. For the sake of clarity, the
right to use any assets included in the Purchased Assets in which Sellers have
leasehold or non-ownership rights to use shall be assigned to Purchaser only
through the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts in accordance
with and subject to this Agreement.

4.6  _Real Property_.

(a) _Schedule 4.6(a)_ contains a list and brief description of all Leased Real
Property held or used for, or necessary to the operation of the Business.
Sellers have made available true and complete copies of all leases with
respect to such Leased Real Property (individually, a " _Lease_ " and
collectively, the " _Leases_ ") to Purchaser. _Schedule 4.6(a)_ also
identifies each ground lease between Sellers and the owner of the fee title to
the demised premises (each, a " _Ground Lease_ "). Other than as set forth on
_Schedule 4.6(a)_, Sellers are not in breach of any material term or in
"default" under any Lease and, to Sellers Knowledge, no party to any Lease
has given Sellers written notice of or made a claim with respect to
any breach or default thereunder. To Sellers Knowledge, there are no
conditions that currently exist or with the passage of time will (i) result in
a default or breach of any material term by any party to a Lease or (ii) give
rise to the right of the lessor to accelerate the obligations thereunder or
modify the terms thereof. To Sellers Knowledge, other than as noted on
_Schedule 4.6(a)_ , none of the Leased Real Property is subject to any
sublease or grant to any Person of any right to the use, occupancy or
enjoyment of the Leased Real Property or any portion thereof that would
materially impair the use of the Leased Real Property in the operation of the
Business. To Sellers Knowledge, the Leased Real Property is not subject to
any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) that were placed on the
Leased Real Property through the action or inaction of Sellers and materially
impact the Business use of the Leased Real Property. To Sellers Knowledge,
the Leased Real Property is not subject to any use restrictions, exceptions,
reservations or limitations which in any material respect interfere with or
impair the present and continued use thereof in the Ordinary Course
of Business. To Sellers Knowledge, there are no pending or threatened
condemnation or other proceedings or claims relating to any of the Leased Real
Property. To Sellers Knowledge, the Leases with respect to the Assumed Leased
Real Property will continue to be legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in
full force and effect on the same material terms immediately following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. No rent under any Lease
has been paid more than one month in advance.

 



18 (b) _Schedule 4.6(b)(i)_ sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all
Owned Real Property, specifying the street address, the current owner and the
current use of each parcel of Owned Real Property in which any of the Sellers
has any title interest and which is related to, used, useful or held for use
in the conduct of the Business (the _"Owned Real Property"_ ). Except for
Permitted Encumbrances, Sellers have good and marketable title in the Owned
Real Property set forth on _Schedule 4.6(b)_. To Sellers Knowledge, other
than as noted on _Schedule 4.6(b)(i)_ , none of the Owned Real Property is
subject to any lease or grant to any Person of any right to the use, purchase,
occupancy or enjoyment of such Owned Real Property or any portion thereof
required to conduct the Business. Except for Permitted Encumbrances, the
Owned Real Property is not subject to any Encumbrances or to any use
restrictions, exceptions, reservations or limitations, which in any material
respect interfere with or impair the present and continued use thereof in the
Ordinary Course of Business and in the same manner after the Closing as
conducted by Sellers prior to Closing. There are no pending or, to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened condemnation proceedings relating to any of the Owned
Real Property. _Schedule 4.6(b)(ii)_ sets forth a true, correct and complete
list of buildings owned by Sellers which are subject to a Ground Lease (the "
_Owned Buildings_ "), specifying the street address and applicable Ground
Lease. Each of the Owned Buildings is subject to the applicable Ground Lease
landlords automatic reversionary interest upon expiration or termination of
the Ground Lease. Other than as noted in _Schedule 4.6(b)(ii)_ , none of the
Owned Buildings are subject to any sublease or grant to any Person of any
right to the use, purchase, occupancy or enjoyment of such Owned Buildings or
any portion thereof required to conduct the Business. Except for
Permitted Encumbrances, the Owned Buildings are not subject to any
Encumbrances or to any use restrictions, exceptions, reservations or
limitations, which in any material respect interfere with or impair the
present and continued use thereof in the Ordinary Course of Business and in
the same manner after the Closing as conducted by Sellers prior to Closing.
There are no pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened condemnation
proceedings relating to any of the Owned Buildings. There are no unrecorded
outstanding options, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal to
Purchase Owned Real Properties or any properties thereof or interest therein.
There are no physical defects in the Owned Buildings that would interfere with
their current use or operation.

(c) To the Sellers Knowledge, neither the Owned Real Property nor Leased Real
Property serves any adjoining property for any purpose inconsistent with the
use of the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property, as the case may be
and, to Sellers Knowledge, neither the Owned Real Property nor the Leased
Real Property is located within an flood plain or subject to any similar type
of construction for which Permits necessary to the use thereof have not been
obtained. To the Sellers Knowledge, neither the current use of the Owned Real
Property and Leased Real Property nor the operation of the Business violates
any instrument of record or agreement or any applicable legal requirements,
building code or zoning ordinance. To the Sellers Knowledge, neither the
whole nor any material portion of any Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property has been damaged or destroyed by fire or casualty.

(d) No Seller is a "foreign person," foreign trust" or "foreign corporation"
within the meaning of the Code.

4.7 _Tangible Personal Property_.  _Schedule 4.7_ sets forth all leases of
personal property (" _Personal Property Leases_ ") relating to personal
property used by Sellers or to which any Seller is a party or by which the
properties or assets of any Seller are bound, in each case relating to the
Business. Each Seller has a valid and enforceable leasehold interest under
each Personal Property Lease under which it is a lessee.

4.8 _Intellectual Property_. _Schedule 4.8_ sets forth an accurate and
complete list of all Intellectual Property necessary to the Business as
currently conducted (the " _Purchased Intellectual_

 



19   _Property_ "). The Sellers own all right, title and interest to the
Purchased Intellectual Property, such rights, title and interest are valid and
enforceable, and the Sellers can convey the Purchased Intellectual Property
free and clear of Liens pursuant to the Sale Order. To the Knowledge of
Sellers, (i) no Person is engaging in any activity that infringes any
Purchased Intellectual Property and (ii) no claim has been asserted to any
Seller that the use of any Purchased Intellectual Property or the operation of
the Business infringes or violates the Intellectual Property of any third
party. The Purchased Intellectual Property and the rights under the Assigned
Contracts necessarily include the rights to use all Intellectual Property
required to operate the Business as currently conducted.

4.9 _Litigation_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.9_ and other than in
connection with the Bankruptcy Cases, there is no suit, action, litigation,
arbitration proceeding or governmental proceeding or audit, including appeals
and applications for review, in progress, pending or, to the best of Sellers
Knowledge, threatened against or relating to any Seller or any judgment,
decree, injunction, deficiency, rule or order of any court, governmental
department, commission, agency, instrumentality or arbitrator which, in any
case, might adversely affect the ability of any Seller to enter into this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
Sellers have no Knowledge of any existing ground on which any such action,
suit or proceeding may be commenced with any reasonable likelihood of success.

4.10 _Permits_. Sellers are in compliance with the material terms of all
material Permits used by Sellers in the Business, and all such Permits are
valid and in full force and effect, and no proceeding is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, threatened, the object of which is to revoke, limit or
otherwise affect any such Permit.

4.11 _Inventory_.

(a) All Inventory of Sellers, whether or not reflected on the Audited
Financial Statements included in the SEC Documents, consists of items of a
good and merchantable quality useable or saleable in the Ordinary Course of
Business, for the purposes for which they are intended, subject to normal,
customary, or non-material allowances for damage and obsolescence. To
Sellers Knowledge, no Inventory is materially damaged in any significant way,
including but not limited to damage caused by water, except for any such
damage which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Inventory taken
as a whole;

(b) To Sellers Knowledge, the Inventory is not part of a current or past
recall;

(c) The Inventory is in working condition except for such failure to be in
working condition which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Inventory taken as a whole.

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.11(d)_ , Sellers do not hold any
Inventory on consignment.

4.12 _Contracts_. The Assigned Contracts include all Contracts material to
the ownership and/or operation of the Business. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.9_, Sellers have not, and, to Sellers Knowledge, no other party
to any Assigned Contract has, commenced any action against any of the parties
to any Assigned Contract or given or received any written notice of any
default or violation under any Assigned Contract that has not been withdrawn
or dismissed except to the extent such default or violation will be cured as a
result of the payment of the applicable Cure Costs. Assuming payment of the
Cure Costs, each Assigned Contract is, or will be upon the Closing, valid,
binding and in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



20 4.13 _Tax Returns; Taxes_.

 

(a) All Tax Returns required to have been filed by the Sellers have been duly
and timely filed and are true, correct and complete in all material respects,
and no material fact has been omitted therefrom. Except as set forth on

Sellers attributable to Tax periods (or portions thereof) commencing after the

prepaid amount received during a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or for any other
reason.

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.13(e)_ , no material Tax Proceeding is

liability to the Purchaser (or any direct or indirect owner thereof).

(j) No Seller has ever been subject to Tax in a jurisdiction in which it does
not currently file Tax Returns or pay Taxes, and no claim has been made by any
Governmental Body in a jurisdiction where any Seller does not file Tax

such plans are qualified and exempt from federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, respectively, and nothing has occurred that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of such
Benefit Plan.

 

(f) No Benefit Plan is subject to Part 3, Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or

involving any Benefit Plan, and no pending or threatened claims (except for
individual claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Benefit

funding medium thereof, fiduciary thereof or service provider thereto, nor to
the Knowledge of the Sellers is there any reasonable basis for any such claim,
suit or proceeding. There has not been any nonexempt prohibited transaction,
within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, with
respect to any Benefit Plan.

due to any current or former employee, director, officer, or independent
contractor of any Seller, (II) limit the right to merge, amend or terminate
any Benefit Plan or (III) result in the payment or provision of an "excess

ARTICLE VI.

EMPLOYEES

 

6.1 _Employee Matters_.

(a) The Purchaser intends to extend offers of employment (which may be for
employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) to all of the Sellers
employees related to the Purchased Assets as of the date hereof who have not
been terminated or otherwise left the employ of the Sellers prior to the
Closing Date. Sellers have made available to Purchaser a correct and complete
list of all their current employees. The Sellers shall provide Purchaser
access to their personnel records and personnel files, and shall provide such
other information regarding their employees as Purchaser may reasonably
request. All such employees who accept such offers of employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates are hereinafter referred to as the " _Transferred
Employees_ " and such acceptance of offers shall be effective immediately
after the Closing. Effective as of immediately before the Closing, each Seller
shall terminate the employment of its respective employees who are
Transferred Employees. Each Transferred Employee shall be eligible to
participate in all of Purchasers employee benefit plans in accordance with
the terms of those plans, to the same extent and in the same manner as new
employees of Purchaser or, at Purchasers sole discretion, Purchaser may
permit or require the Transferred Employees to continue to participate in the
Assumed Plans.

 

(b) Subject to Purchasers right to terminate any Transferred Employees, for a
period of one year from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide
each Transferred Employee with (i) base compensation/wage rate that is no
lower than that provided to such Transferred Employees as of the date of this
Agreement; (ii) bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than that would
have existed if Transferred Employee were still employed by Seller; (iii)
other employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided by Seller, including, but not limited to, vacation days and
other paid-time-off; and (iv) any base compensation/wage rate increases that
Sellers have committed to providing to any Transferred Employees, but which
increases have not been enacted as of the Closing Date, as set forth in
_Schedule 6.1(b)_. For purposes of eligibility, vesting, participation and
benefit accrual under any Purchaser plans and programs providing employee
benefits to Transferred Employees after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing
Plans_ "), each Transferred Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with Sellers before the Closing Date to the same extent as such
Transferred Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such
service under substantially similar Seller Employee Benefit Plans in which
such Transferred Employees participated before the Closing Date, except to the
extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(c) For purposes of each Post-Closing Plan providing medical, dental,
hospital, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Transferred Employee,
Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to

 



30  cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such Post-Closing Plan for such Transferred Employee and
his or her covered dependents (unless such exclusions or requirements were
applicable under comparable Benefit Plans). In addition, Purchaser shall use
reasonable efforts to cause any co-payments, deductible and other eligible
expenses incurred by such Transferred Employee and/or his or her covered
dependents under any Benefit Plan providing, medical, dental, hospital,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits during the plan year ending on the Closing
Date to be credited for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Transferred Employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year of each
comparable Post-Closing Plan in which he or she participates.

 

(d) Purchaser shall assume and honor all vacation days and other paid-time-off
accrued or earned during the one (1) year period ending on the Petition Date,
but not yet taken, by each Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date, which
shall be delivered by Sellers to Purchaser no later than five (5) Business
Days after the Closing Date.

 

(e) The Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of any severance payment
or benefits that become due to any current or former employee, officer,
director, member, partner or independent contractor as a result of the
termination of such individual by any Seller or ERISA Affiliate thereof. The
Sellers shall be responsible for all legally mandated health care
continuation coverage for their, and their Affiliates, current and former
employees (and their qualified beneficiaries) who had or have a loss of
coverage due to a "qualifying event" (within the meaning of Section 603 of
ERISA) which occurred or occurs on or prior to the Closing Date including,
without limitation, any loss of coverage that results directly or indirectly
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall be responsible for any severance benefits for any
Transferred Employee who terminates employment with the Purchaser or such
Affiliate after the Closing Date.

(f) At least two days prior to the Closing, Purchaser will provide the Sellers
a list of the Benefit Plans that it will assume, if any (the " _Assumed Plans_
"). Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other, shall take
such actions as are necessary and reasonably requested by the other Party to
cause Purchaser to assume sponsorship of the Assumed Plans as of the Closing
and to effect the transfer of all assets and benefit liabilities of the
Assumed Plans together with all related trust, insurance policies and
administrative services agreements, effective as soon as practicable following
the Closing; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be assuming or be
responsible for any liabilities or obligations arising with respect to or in
connection with such Assumed Plans to the extent such liabilities or
obligations arose prior to Closing or with respect to any employee or former
employee of the Sellers who does not become a Transferred Employee (except to
cause payment for any claim appropriately covered by a transferred insurance
policy).

(g) On and following the Agreement Date, Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate in all matters reasonably necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 6.1_, including exchanging information and
data relating to workers compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit
plan coverage, and in obtaining any governmental approvals required hereunder,
except as would result in the violation of any applicable Legal Requirement,
including without limitation, any Legal Requirement relating to the
safeguarding of data privacy.

 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 6.1_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement only and shall not be construed to grant any
rights, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, to any person who is not a
party to this Agreement, nor shall any provision of this Agreement be deemed
to be the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that
term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise to limit the right of
Purchaser or the Sellers to amend, modify or terminate any

 



31  such employee benefit plan. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be
construed to (i) prohibit any amendments to or termination of any employee
benefit plans or (ii) prohibit the termination or change in terms of
employment of any employee (including any Transferred Employee) as permitted
under applicable law. Nothing herein, expressed or implied, shall confer upon
any employee (including any Transferred Employee) any rights or remedies
(including, without limitation, any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period) of any nature or kind whatsoever, under
or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

complete copy of which shall be attached to such application or motion without
schedules) and the Sellers authority to enter into this Agreement (the "
_Sale and Bidding Procedures Motion_ "); _provided_ , that such application or
motion and all exhibits thereto shall be in form and substance acceptable to
Purchaser, in its sole discretion.

(b) This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to
Sellers right and ability to consider higher or better competing bids with
respect to the Business and a material portion of the Purchased Assets
pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order (each a " _Competing Bid_ ").
Following completion of the Auction, if Purchaser is the Prevailing Bidder,
Sellers shall not initiate contact with, solicit or encourage submission of
any inquiries, proposals or offers by, any Person in connection with any sale
or other disposition of the Purchased Assets. In addition, unless otherwise
directed by the Bankruptcy Court, Sellers shall not after completion of the
Auction respond to or pursue any proposed Alternative Transaction or perform
any other acts related thereto.

 

(c) If an Auction is conducted, and Purchaser is not the prevailing party at
the conclusion of such Auction (such prevailing party, the " _Prevailing
Bidder_ "), Purchaser shall, if its bid is determined to be the next highest
bid, have the option, in its sole discretion, to serve as a back-up bidder

 



32  (the " _Back-up Bidder_ ") and keep Purchasers bid to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon in the Auction)
open and irrevocable until the earlier of (i) 5:00 p.m. (prevailing Eastern
time) on the date which is fifteen (15) days after the date of the Sale
Hearing (the " _Outside Back-up Date_ "); provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Outside Back-up Date be
later than September 16, 2013 or (ii) the date of closing of an Alternative
Transaction with the Prevailing Bidder. Following the Sale Hearing and prior
to the Outside Back-up Date, if the Prevailing Bidder fails to consummate the
applicable Alternative Transaction as a result of a breach or failure to
perform on the part of such Prevailing Bidder, the Back-up Bidder will be
deemed to have the new prevailing bid, and Seller will be authorized, without
further order of the Bankruptcy Court, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement (as the same may be improved upon in the Auction) with the Back-up
Bidder.

(d) The Sellers shall promptly serve true and correct copies of the Sale and
Bidding Procedures Motion and all related pleadings in accordance with the
Bidding Procedures Order, the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy
Procedure, the Local Rules for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
District of Delaware and any other applicable order of the Bankruptcy Court.

7.3 _Sale Order_. The Sale Order shall be entered by the Bankruptcy Court.
The Sale Order shall, among other things, (i) approve, pursuant to Sections
105, 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, (A) the execution, delivery and
performance by Sellers of this Agreement, (B) the sale of the Purchased
Assets to Purchaser on the terms set forth herein and free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than Encumbrances included in the Assumed Liabilities and
Permitted Encumbrances), and (C) the performance by Sellers of their
respective obligations under this Agreement; (ii) authorize and empower
Sellers to assume and assign to Purchaser the Assigned Contracts; and (iii)
find that Purchaser is a "good faith" buyer within the meaning of Section
363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, not a successor to any Sellers and grant
Purchaser the protections of Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code. Purchaser
agrees that it will promptly take such actions as are reasonably requested
by Sellers to assist in obtaining Bankruptcy Court approval of the Sale
Order, including furnishing affidavits or other documents or information for
filing with the Bankruptcy Court for purposes, among others, of (a)
demonstrating that Purchaser is a "good faith" purchaser under Section 363(m)
of the Bankruptcy Code, and (b) establishing adequate assurance of future
performance within the meaning of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

7.4 _Contracts_. Sellers shall serve on all non-Seller counterparties to all
of their Contracts a notice specifically stating that Sellers are or may be
seeking the assumption and assignment of such Contracts and shall notify such
non-Seller counterparties of the deadline for objecting to the Cure Costs, if
any, which deadline shall not be less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Sale Hearing.

7.5 _Bankruptcy Filings_. From and after the Agreement Date and until the
Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser drafts of any and all
material pleadings, motions, notices, statements, schedules, applications,
reports and other papers to be filed or submitted in connection with this
Agreement for Purchasers prior review and comment, including any Tax
motions, and such filings shall be acceptable to Purchaser in its sole
discretion to the extent they relate to the Purchased Assets, any Assumed
Liabilities or any of Purchasers obligations hereunder. Sellers agree to
diligently prosecute the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale
Order. In the event the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale
Order shall be appealed, Sellers shall use their best efforts to defend such
appeal. Sellers shall comply with all notice requirements (i) of the
Bankruptcy Code and the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, or (ii) imposed
by the Sale Order, in each case, in connection with any pleading, notice or
motion to be filed in connection herewith.

 



33 7.6 _Sale Free and Clear_. Sellers acknowledge and agree, and the Sale Order
shall provide that, on the Closing Date and concurrently with the Closing,
all then existing or thereafter arising obligations, Liabilities and
Encumbrances of, against or created by Sellers or their bankruptcy estate, to
the fullest extent permitted by Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, shall be
fully released from and with respect to the Purchased Assets. On the Closing
Date, the Purchased Assets shall be transferred to Purchaser free and clear of
all obligations, Liabilities and Encumbrances, other than Permitted
Encumbrances and the Assumed Liabilities to the fullest extent permitted by
Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Purchaser of any Assigned Contract pursuant to this Agreement is not
permitted without the consent of a third party and such restriction cannot be
effectively overridden or canceled by the Sale Order or other related order of
the Bankruptcy Court, then this Agreement will not be deemed to constitute an
assignment of or an undertaking or attempt to assign such Contract or any
right or interest therein unless and until such consent is obtained;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties will use their commercially
reasonable efforts, before the Closing, to obtain all such consents;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if any such consents are not obtained prior to
the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser will reasonably cooperate with each
other in any lawful and feasible arrangement designed to provide Purchaser

responsible for performing all obligations under such Contract required to be
performed by Sellers on or after the Closing Date to the extent set forth in
this Agreement.

take, or cause to be taken, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to cause the transactions
contemplated herein to be effected as soon as practicable, but in any event on
or prior to the Outside Date, in accordance with the terms hereof and
shall cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with each other Party and
its Representatives in connection with any step required to be taken as a part
of its obligations hereunder.

 



36 (b) In the event that any of the Parties to this Agreement discovers a

Liabilities during the period from and after the Agreement Date, and such
Contract (i) was unknown as of the Agreement Date, (ii) is a Contract that
Purchaser wishes to assume the rights and obligations of and (iii) such

Seller shall execute, acknowledge and deliver such other instruments and take
such further actions as are reasonably practicable for Purchaser to assume
the rights and obligations under such Contract.

(c) The obligations of Seller pursuant to this  _Section 8.5_ shall be
subject to any orders entered, or approvals or authorizations granted or
required, by or under the Bankruptcy Court or the Bankruptcy Code (including

(including the Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale Order) and Sellers duty
to seek and obtain the highest or otherwise best price for the Business
as required by the Bankruptcy Code.

(d) Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, will provide
each other with such cooperation and information as either of them may
reasonably request of the other in connection with filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a
right to a refund of Taxes, or participating in or conducting any audit or
other proceeding in respect of Taxes (such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together
with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to
rulings and other determinations by Tax authorities). In addition, Purchaser
shall make available to Sellers, without charge to Sellers, such office space
and employee support reasonably necessary to assist Sellers to wind up
Sellers operations following the Closing, resolve the Bankruptcy Cases,
dissolve any or all of the Sellers and prepare and file the Tax Returns. Any
information obtained under this _Section 8.5(d)_ shall be kept
confidential except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting any audit or other
proceeding.

(e) Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, (i) shall
promptly inform each other of any communication from any Governmental Body
concerning this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, and any
filing, notification or request for approval and (ii) shall permit the other
to review in advance any proposed written or material oral communication or
information submitted to any such Governmental Body in response thereto. In
addition, none of Parties shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Body in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, unless such Party consults with the other Parties in advance and, to
the extent permitted by any such Governmental Body, gives the other Parties
the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, in each case to the maximum
extent practicable. Subject to restrictions under any Law, each of Purchaser,
on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall furnish the other with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives on the one hand, and the Governmental Body or
members of its staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby (excluding documents and communications
which are subject to preexisting confidentiality agreements or to the
attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine or which refer to valuation
of the Business) or any such filing, notification or request for approval.
Each Party shall also furnish the other Party with such necessary information
and assistance as such other Party and its Affiliates may reasonably request
in connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registration or
submissions of information to the Governmental Body in connection with this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and any such filing,
notification or request for approval.

 



37 8.6 _Further Assurances_. Each Party shall execute and cause to be delivered
to each other Party such instruments and other documents, and shall take such
other actions, as such other Party may reasonably request (prior to, at or
after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or evidencing any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing, each Seller
shall promptly transfer or deliver to Purchaser cash, checks (which shall be
properly endorsed) or other property that any Seller may receive in respect of
any deposit, prepaid expense, receivable or other item that constitutes part
of the Purchased Assets or relates to the Assumed Liabilities.

8.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Sellers shall give prompt notice to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to Sellers, of (i) any

such Person which is or may be required in connection with the transactions

obtained prior to Closing, (ii) any written objection or proceeding that
challenges the transactions contemplated hereby or the entry of the approval
of the Bankruptcy Court and (iii) the status of matters relating to the
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received
by Sellers or Purchaser or by any of their respective Affiliates (as the case
may be), from any third party and/or any Governmental Body with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

8.8 _Confidentiality_.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the confidential information provided to them
in connection with this Agreement, including under _Section 8.2_, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, is subject to the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Following the completion of the Auction, Sellers agree to maintain,
unless disclosure is required by applicable Law, the confidentiality of any
confidential information regarding the Business which is in Sellers
possession or of which Sellers are aware. Sellers hereby further agree,
unless disclosure is required by applicable Law, to take all appropriate
steps, consistent with Sellers past practice, to safeguard such confidential
information and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, loss and theft.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Sellers shall not,
unless required by applicable Law, disclose to any Person (a) any confidential
information regarding the Business, _provided_ , that confidential information
shall not include information that becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of the breach of this _Section 8.8(b)_ or information
not otherwise known by the Sellers that becomes available to any Seller from a
Person other than Purchaser, or (b) any of the discussions or negotiations
conducted with Purchaser in connection with this Agreement, _provided_ , that
Sellers shall be entitled to disclose (i) any information required to be
disclosed by Sellers to the Bankruptcy Court, the United States Trustee,
parties in interest in the Bankruptcy Cases, other Persons bidding on assets
of Sellers, (ii) any information required to be disclosed by Sellers pursuant
to any applicable Law (including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code),
legal proceeding or Governmental Authority, or (iii) any information to
Sellers counsel and financial advisor; _provided_ , that, in each case, such
disclosure shall be limited to the information that is so required to be
disclosed and the Person(s) to whom such disclosure is required.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.8_ to the contrary, unless
disclosure is required by applicable Law, the confidentiality of any trade
secrets of the Business shall be maintained for so long as such trade secrets
continue to be entitled to protection as trade secrets of the Business.

 



38 8.9 _Preservation of Records_. Sellers (or any subsequently appointed
bankruptcy estate representative, including, but not limited to, a trustee, a
creditor trustee or a plan administrator) and Purchaser agree that each of
them shall preserve and keep the books and records held by it relating to the
pre-Closing Business for a period of three (3) months from the Closing Date
and shall make such books and records available to the other Parties (and
permit such other Party to make extracts and copies of such books and records
at its own expense) as may be reasonably required by such Party in connection
with, among other things, any insurance claims by, legal proceedings or Tax
audits against or governmental investigations of Sellers or Purchaser or in
order to enable Sellers or Purchaser to comply with their
respective obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement,
document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event Sellers,
on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, wish to destroy such records
during such three (3) month period, such Party shall first give twenty (20)
days prior written notice to the other and such other Party shall have the
right at its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to such Party
within that twenty (20) day period, to take possession of the records within
thirty (30) days after the date of such notice.

8.10 _Publicity_. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall issue any press release
or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless, in the sole judgment of Purchaser or Seller, disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law or by the Bankruptcy Court with respect to filings
to be made with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with this Agreement or by
the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Purchaser or Seller lists
securities, _provided_ that the party intending to make such release shall use
its best efforts consistent with such applicable Law or Bankruptcy Court
requirement to consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof.

8.11 _Material Adverse Effect_. Sellers shall promptly inform Purchaser in
writing of the occurrence of any event that has had, or is reasonably expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

8.12 _Casualty Loss_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if, before the Closing, all or any portion of the Purchased Assets
is (a) condemned or taken by eminent domain, or (b) is damaged or destroyed
by fire, flood or other casualty, Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly in
writing of such fact, (i) in the case of condemnation or taking, Seller shall
assign or pay, as the case may be, any proceeds thereof to Purchaser at the
Closing, and (ii) in the case of fire, flood or other casualty, Seller shall
assign the insurance proceeds therefrom to Purchaser at Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this  _Section 8.12_ shall
not in any way modify Purchasers other rights under this Agreement, including
any applicable right to terminate the Agreement if any condemnation, taking,
damage or other destruction resulted in a Material Adverse Effect.

8.13 _No Successor Liability_. The Parties intend that, except where expressly
prohibited under applicable Law, upon the Closing, Purchaser shall not be
deemed to: (i) be the successor of Sellers, (ii) have, _de facto_ , or
otherwise, merged with or into Sellers, (iii) be a mere continuation or
substantial continuation of Sellers or the enterprise(s) of Sellers, or (iv)
be liable for any acts or omissions of Sellers in the conduct of the Business
or arising under or related to the Purchased Assets other than as set forth in
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Parties intend that Purchaser
shall not be liable for any Encumbrance (other than Assumed Liabilities and
Permitted Encumbrances) against Sellers or any of Sellers predecessors or
Affiliates, and Purchaser shall have no successor or vicarious liability of
any kind or character whether known or unknown as of the Closing Date, whether
now existing or hereafter arising, or whether fixed or contingent,
with respect to the Business, the Purchased Assets or any Liabilities of
Sellers arising prior to the Closing Date. The Parties agree that the
provisions substantially in the form of this _Section 8.13_ shall be
reflected in the Sale Order. 

 



39 8.14 _Change of Name_. Promptly following the Closing, each Seller shall, and
shall cause its direct and indirect Subsidiaries to, discontinue the use of
its current name (and any other trade names or "d/b/a" names currently
utilized by each Seller or its direct or indirect Subsidiaries) and shall not
subsequently change its name to or otherwise use or employ any name which
includes the words "Orchard", "Orchard Supply Hardware" and/or "OSH" without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, and each Seller shall cause the names
of Sellers in the caption of the Bankruptcy Cases to be changed to the new
names of each Seller as provided in the last sentence of this _Section 8.14_.
Notwithstanding the above, Sellers and their Subsidiaries may continue to use
their current names and any other names or DBAs currently utilized by the
Sellers or their subsidiaries in relation to the wind-down of stores or GOB
Sales, which will proceed as quickly as possible.

 

8.15 _Receivables_. From and after the Closing, if any Seller receives or
collects any funds relating to Accounts Receivable, in respect of the
Purchased Assets, such Seller shall remit such funds to Purchaser within Five
Business Days after its receipt thereof.

8.16 _Antitrust Approvals_. (a) Purchaser and Sellers will (i) make or cause
to be made all filings required of each of them or any of their respective
Affiliates under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and, in any event,
within 10 Business Days after the entry of the Bidding Procedure Order in the
case of all filings required under the HSR Act and within four weeks in the
case of all other filings required by other Antitrust Laws, (ii) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents or other
materials received by each of them or any of their respective subsidiaries
from Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") or any
other Governmental Body in respect of such filings or such transactions, and
(iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing (including,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to
reasonable confidentiality considerations, providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and considering all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith)
and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of
the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental Body under any Antitrust
Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Subject to
applicable Law, the Parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any Party hereto relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws. Sellers and Purchaser may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 8.16_ as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein will be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient, unless
express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be).

(b) Each of Purchaser and Sellers will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United
States federal or state or foreign treaties, statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other Laws that
are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the " _Antitrust
Laws_ "). In

 



40  connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement is in
violation of any Antitrust Law, each of Purchaser and Sellers will cooperate
and use its commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent (" _Antitrust Order_ "), that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal and all available legislative action, unless, by mutual
agreement, Purchaser and Sellers decide that litigation is not in their
respective best interests. Each of Purchaser and Sellers will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice or waiting periods under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible
after the execution of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary with respect to any actions, non-
actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals or Permits from any
Governmental Body with respect to any Antitrust Laws that are required to be
obtained in connection with this Agreement, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
not be required to, and the Sellers shall not, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser (which may be withheld in Purchasers sole discretion),
(i) enter into any hold separate order, (ii) sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate, before or after
