ARTICLE 2



CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



Section 2.1Effect on Capital Stock



(a)At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the
Company or Merger Sub:



(i)Conversion of Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (collectively, the "Common Stock," and each, a "Share"
and together, the "Shares") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than Cancelled Shares and Converted Shares, shall be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive $60.50 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"). All Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and the holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the right to receive any then declared and unpaid dividend
or other distribution with respect to such Shares having a record date before
the Effective Time (in each case, less any applicable withholding Taxes) in
accordance with this Article 2.



(ii) Company-, Parent- and Merger Sub-Owned Shares. Each Share of Common Stock
that is owned directly by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Cancelled Shares") shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such cancellation and retirement. Each Share of Common Stock that
is owned directly by any Subsidiary of the Company, any Subsidiary of Parent
(other than Merger Sub) or any Subsidiary of Merger Sub (the "Converted
Shares") as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation so as to
maintain relative ownership percentages. No Merger Consideration shall be paid
in respect of Cancelled Shares or Converted Shares. 

(iii) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.



(b)Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Shares of Common Stock of the Company shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of
shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change.



Section 2.2Exchange of Certificates



(a)Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be
appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and reasonably approved in
advance by the Company (the "Paying Agent"), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and
the Converted Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares ("Certificates")
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares
represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 2 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund").



(b)Payment Procedures.



(i)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares whose
Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as is customary), and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.



(ii)Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of
Shares represented by such holder\'s properly surrendered Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares and (y) the
Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes). No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares. 



(iii)The Paying Agent, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was properly made.



(c)Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(d)Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the
former holders of Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall
thereafter be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any
former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance
with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon due surrender of Certificates for their Shares (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof).



(e)No Liability. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.



(f)Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; provided,
however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government; provided, further, that no
such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to this Article 2, and following any losses from any such
investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent
for the benefit of the holders of Shares of Common Stock of the Company. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2(d). 

(g)Transferred Shares. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry
Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other similar Tax
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.



(h)Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number
of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied
by the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes).



Section 2.3Treatment of Company Equity Awards

(a)Company Options.



(i)Each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that is vested as of the date hereof or becomes vested prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms or Section 2.3 of the Company
Disclosure Letter (each, a "Vested Option") shall as of the Effective Time, be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share of such Vested Option and (y) the total number of Shares subject to
such Vested Option. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to the
holders of Vested Options the cash amounts described in the immediately
preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payment, promptly but in any event within
seven days following the Effective Time.



(ii)Each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (and does
not become vested in accordance with Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure
Letter) (each, an "Unvested Option") shall as of the Effective Time,
automatically convert into an award to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share of such Unvested Option and (y) the total number of
Shares subject to such Unvested Option. Such converted award shall remain
subject to the same vesting terms and conditions that applied to such award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including continued employment with
Parent or the Company through the applicable vesting date, and the applicable
cash amounts shall be paid out, less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, promptly but in
any event within thirty days of the vesting date. 

(iii) If the applicable exercise price per Share of any Company Option equals
or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled
without payment of additional consideration, and all rights with respect to
such Company Option shall terminate as of the Effective Time.



(b)Company RSUs.



(i)Each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that becomes vested at the Effective Time in accordance with its terms or
Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a "Vested RSU"), shall as
of the Effective Time, automatically convert into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject
to such Vested RSU and (y) the Merger Consideration. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay to the holders of Vested RSUs the cash amounts
described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, promptly
but in any event within seven days following the Effective Time.



(ii)Each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (and does
not become vested in accordance with Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure
Letter) (each, an "Unvested RSU"), shall as of the Effective Time,
automatically convert into an award to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Unvested RSU and (y)
the Merger Consideration. Such converted award shall remain subject to the
same vesting terms and conditions that applied to such award immediately prior
to the Effective Time, including continued employment with Parent or the
Company through the applicable vesting date, and shall be paid, less such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment, on the same payment schedule as applied to such award
immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any award of Company Options or Company
RSUs that is subject to performance-based vesting and for which the
performance period is incomplete as of the Effective Time, the performance
with respect to such awards will be determined in accordance with Section 2.3
of the Company Disclosure Letter.



(d)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, through its Board of Directors or
an appropriate committee thereof, will adopt such resolutions as may
reasonably be required in its discretion to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this Section 2.3 and to ensure that no holder of a Company
Equity Award shall have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the
Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to any award
previously granted under a Company Stock Plan, except as provided in this
Section 2.3. 



Section 2.4Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company shall take all necessary
action to ensure (i) that no new offering periods under the Company Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated (the "ESPP") will commence during
the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, (ii)
that there will be no increase in the amount of payroll deductions permitted
to be made by the participants under the ESPP during the current offering
period, except those made in accordance with payroll deduction elections that
already are in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and (iii) that no
individual shall commence participation in the ESPP during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time. The accumulated
contributions of the participants in the current offering period shall be used
to purchase Shares as of no later than ten Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, and the participants\' purchase rights under such offerings
shall terminate immediately after such purchase. As of no later than the
Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
terminate the ESPP.

preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (ii) receipts and
expenditures are being made in accordance with the authorization of management
and directors of the Company, and (iii) any unauthorized use, acquisition or

ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the 

certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. The Company\'s management has completed an assessment of the

Since January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee, auditor,

thereto).



Section 3.7Affiliate Party Transactions. Since January 1, 2014, there have
been no transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and any Affiliate of the
Company (other than the Company\'s Subsidiaries) or between the Company and

Section 3.8Compliance with Law; Permits.



(a)The Company and its Subsidiaries have since January 1, 2014, been in
compliance with and not in default under or in violation of any applicable
material federal, state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule,

businesses as they are now being conducted (the "Company Permits"), except
where the failure to have or comply with any of the Company Permits would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All

Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not a common carrier nor does
it provide common carrier services, including international telecommunications

to provide to Merger Sub so it can pay and satisfy) in full in cash the
aggregate Merger Consideration and to perform its obligations under this
Agreement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the treatment of 

Company Equity Awards, and all payments, fees and expenses payable by Parent

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Required

its Subsidiaries\' properties, contracts, commitments, books and records,
other than any such matters that relate to the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement, including the Company\'s process of considering potential
strategic alternatives leading up to the execution of this Agreement or
otherwise with respect to the consideration or valuation of the Merger or any
actual or potential financial or strategic alternatives thereto, or any
Alternative Proposal or Superior Proposal. The foregoing notwithstanding, the
Company shall not be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably
disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause
a violation of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party (provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of such third Person to such agreement), would
cause a risk of a loss of privilege or trade secret protection to the Company

Law.



(b)Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it or any Parent
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be Evaluation Material, as
such term is used in, and shall be treated in accordance with, the

Greeneden U.S. Holdings II, LLC (the "Confidentiality Agreement").



Section 5.3No Solicitation.



(a)Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.3, from the date hereof until
the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, the Company agrees
that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, cooperate with, knowingly
facilitate or knowingly induce the making of any submission or announcement of
an Alternative Proposal or the making of any inquiry, offer or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative Proposal, (ii)
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding an
Alternative Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic information regarding an
Alternative Proposal to, any Person that has made or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, is considering making an Alternative Proposal (except, in each case,
solely to notify such Person of the existence of the provisions of this
Section 5.3), (iii) approve, endorse or recommend an Alternative Proposal,
(iv) terminate, amend, release, modify or fail to enforce any provision of, or
grant any permission, waiver or request under, any confidentiality agreement
entered into by the Company in respect of or in contemplation of an
Alternative Proposal, (v) take any action to make the provisions of any
takeover laws inapplicable to any Alternative Proposal, (vi) enter into any
letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any
Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements permitted under
Section 5.3(b)) or (vii) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.



(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company receives
an Alternative Proposal that was not solicited in violation of Section 5.3(a)
and that either constitutes, or that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal and financial
advisors would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, the
Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to
the third party making such Alternative Proposal, if, prior to so furnishing
such information, 

the third party has entered into an executed confidentiality agreement with
the Company having provisions as to confidential treatment of information that
are not materially less favorable to the Company than the confidentiality
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the third party with respect to the Alternative Proposal;
provided that (i) the Company shall notify Parent orally (and then in writing
within twenty-four (24) hours) of any inquiry made to the Company with respect
to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative
Proposal, the identity of the Person or group making any such Alternative
Proposal, request or inquiry, the terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal, request or inquiry, copies of all written documents, requests or
inquiries relating to any Alternative Proposal (including the financing
thereof), and (ii) contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public
information to such third party (and/or its Representatives), the Company
shall furnish or make available such non-public information to Parent or its
Representatives (to the extent such information has not been previously
furnished to Parent). The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that any
material violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3 by any
Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative of the Company of any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the
Company.



(c)Except as set forth in this Section 5.3, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall not (i) fail to make, withdraw, qualify (or modify in any manner
adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify (or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent), the Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend or
declare advisable any Alternative Proposal or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable any Alternative Proposal, (iii) take any formal
action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer
or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of Directors
of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or (iv) enter
into any agreement, contract or agreement in principle requiring the Company
to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations hereunder or fail to
consummate the Merger (any such action, a "Change of Recommendation").
Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company after
the date of this Agreement on an unsolicited basis, (x) make a Change of
Recommendation or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(g) (provided that prior to or simultaneously with such
termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal and paid the Company Termination Fee) solely
in the event that:



(i)the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal
after the date of this Agreement;



(ii)the Company shall have given Parent at least five Business Days\' written
notice (a "Superior Proposal Notice") advising Parent of its intention to make
such a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement (the "Superior
Proposal Notice Period"), which Superior Proposal Notice shall include all
material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis for
the proposed action of the Board of Directors of the Company, the identity of
the Person making the Superior Proposal and a copy of the most current version
of the proposed definitive agreement for such Superior Proposal;



(iii)if requested by Parent, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the
Company shall have met and negotiated with Parent regarding modifications to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal
ceases to be a Superior Proposal; 

(iv)at the end of such Superior Proposal Notice Period, after taking into
account any binding commitments made by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement during the period following delivery of such Superior Proposal
Notice, the Board of Directors of the Company concludes that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal; provided that (x) any material modifications to the terms
of the Superior Proposal shall commence a new Superior Proposal Notice Period
under clause (ii) of three Business Days; and



(v)the Board of Directors of the Company determines (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and after considering any counter-offer or proposal
made by Parent pursuant to clause (iv) above), that, in light of such Superior
Proposal, the failure to terminate this Agreement or effect a Change of
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law;



(d)Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board
of Directors from (i) disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, if the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Company\'s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of
Directors of the Company to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with
the directors\' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or
from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder (provided, however, that any disclosure other than a
"stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of
an applicable Alternative Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation) or (ii)
making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors of the
Company to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the directors\' exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the Company\'s
shareholders under applicable Law. In the event that, subsequent to the date
hereof and prior to the Company Meeting, there shall have been a Change of
Recommendation as contemplated by Section 5.3(c) and this Agreement has not
been terminated, the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to the
shareholders of the Company for adoption and approval at the Company Meeting.



(e)"Alternative Proposal" means any bona fide inquiry, proposal, indication of
interest or offer made by any Person relating to (i) a merger, reorganization,
share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or
similar transaction or series of related transactions involving the Company,
(ii) the acquisition by any Person, directly or indirectly, of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, or (iii) the acquisition by any Person, directly or
indirectly, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding Shares of
Common Stock or any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in a Person beneficially owning
twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding Shares of Common Stock.



(f)"Superior Proposal" means a written Alternative Proposal, substituting in
the definition thereof "fifty percent (50%)" for "twenty percent (20%)" in
each place it appears, that (i) was not solicited in violation of this Section
5.3, and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Company\'s outside financial and legal advisors,
and considering such factors as Board of Directors of the Company considers to
be (x) reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms,
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of the
proposal, including, to the extent debt financing is required, the likelihood
of obtaining necessary financing, the identity of the Person making such
Alternative Proposal, and whether such proposal is fully financed by means of
an executed customary commitment letter from a reputable Person that has
agreed to provide or cause to be provided the amounts set forth therein, and
(y) if completed, would be more favorable to the Company\'s shareholders from
a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after giving effect to any adjustments to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement agreed to in writing by Parent in response to such Alternative
Proposal).



Section 5.4Filings; Other Actions.



(a)The Company shall prepare (in consultation with Parent) and file with the
SEC the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to Section 5.3, include the
Recommendation, and shall use reasonable best efforts to respond to any
comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the receipt thereof, and shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s shareholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC.
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company such information concerning
themselves and their Affiliates as is customarily included in a proxy
statement prepared in connection with a transaction of the type contemplated
by this Agreement or as otherwise required by Law, requested by the SEC or its
staff or as the Company may reasonably request and the Company shall provide
Parent an opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement and shall consider in good faith any
comments reasonably proposed by Parent.



(b)The Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing
with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, as the case may
be, without providing the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on such written communication which comments shall be considered by the filing
party in good faith.



(c)The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any
receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (A) any amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, as the case may be, (B) any receipt of
comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, as the case may be,
or (C) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional
information in connection therewith.



(d)Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement and as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
(i) take all action required by the IBCL and its articles of incorporation and
bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to
the Company\'s shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval (the "Company Meeting"), and (ii) subject to a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3, use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the adoption
of this Agreement. 

Section 5.5Employee Matters.



(a)For the period of six months after the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to Company employees who continue to
be employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time ("Company Employees") (i) base salary or wages that are no less
favorable than was provided to the Company Employee immediately before the
Effective Time and (ii) all other compensation and benefits (excluding stock
based benefits, if any) that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than
those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries;
provided, that until such time as Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
cause Company Employees to participate in a New Plan (as defined below), a
Company Employee's continued participation in the applicable Company Benefit
Plan shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this clause (ii)
(it being understood that participation in the applicable New Plans may
commence at different times with respect to each Company Benefit Plan).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Company
Employee whose employment is terminated in a severance qualifying termination
(as determined in accordance with the applicable Company Benefit Plan) during
the six-month period following the Effective Time severance benefits at the
same level as the severance benefits that the Company Employee would have been
entitled under the Company Benefit Plans had the Company Employee's employment
been terminated in a severance qualifying termination immediately prior to the
Effective Time.



(b)For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate
and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective
Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to
a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee\'s
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.



(c)Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.



(d)The Company may implement a retention program in accordance with Section
5.5(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

(e)With respect to Company Employees who are eligible to receive a cash bonus
("Annual Bonus Plan Participant") pursuant to the Company annual bonus plans
for 2016 that are in effect as of the date hereof, the Company shall be
permitted to (and if the Effective Time occurs before the payment of such
bonus, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay to each
Annual Bonus Plan Participant his or her annual cash bonus for 2016 based on
actual performance through December 31, 2016 in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Company bonus plans, with any earned payments to be made to
Annual Bonus Plan Participants at the same time after the end of the year as
payments have customarily been made by the Company pursuant to the terms of
the applicable Company bonus plans. After the Effective Time, if an Annual
Bonus Plan Participant's employment is terminated by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation other than for "cause" (as customarily defined by the Parent)
prior to the payment of the earned annual bonus for 2016, such Annual Bonus
Plan Participant shall be entitled to a prorated payment of the actual earned
bonus based on the number of days in 2016 that such Annual Bonus Plan
Participant was employed by the Company and by Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, with the payment to be made at the same time as payments are made
pursuant to the applicable annual bonus plan for employees who remain employed
through the payment date.



(f)As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (and in any
event prior to the Closing Date), the Company shall, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to, take all actions necessary to fulfill all
consultation and notification requirements, and obtain all approvals from, any
works councils or other labor organizations, whether required pursuant to
applicable Law or otherwise.



(g)If requested by Parent in writing no later than fifteen (15) days prior to
the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate
committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take all actions that are
necessary to terminate the Company's 401(k) plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan")
effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan
amendments evidencing that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated in
accordance with its terms.



(h)Without limiting the generality of Section 8.10, the provisions of this
Section 5.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former director, employee or consultant or any other person
shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall
be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation
or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose. Nothing in this Section 5.5
express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or legal
representative or beneficiary thereof or other Person, any rights or remedies,
including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, or a right in any employee or beneficiary of such employee or other
Person under a Company Benefit Plan that such employee or beneficiary or other
Person would not otherwise have under the terms of that Company Benefit Plan.

make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and in any event
prior to the End Date, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, orders, non-objections
and expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Specified

Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty
or other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required
for or triggered by this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby under any contract or agreement or otherwise.



(b)None of the Company, Parent, or Merger Sub shall unilaterally and
voluntarily approach CFIUS with respect to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any party
receives a request from CFIUS to file a notification with respect to the
transaction ("CFIUS Request"), the party receiving such request must promptly
provide written notice or request to all other parties.



(c)Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) promptly, but in
no event later than 10 Business Days after the date hereof, file any and all

may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities, competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction, CFIUS (if applicable),
or any other Person may assert under any Antitrust Law or Exon-Florio (if
applicable) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law or Exon-Florio
(if applicable) that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof (and in any event no later than the End Date), including
(x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, hold
separate or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (y)
otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Parent\'s or its Subsidiaries\' (including the Surviving
Corporation\'s) or Affiliates\' freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries\' (including the
Surviving Corporation\'s) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as
may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any Action
that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, delaying the
Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date; provided that neither
Parent, the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required
to become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with
respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order to
sell, divest, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct,
restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, operations or
business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or
order is conditioned upon the Closing.

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not be required to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be required to and, without the prior written consent
of Parent shall not, take any action, or agree to any condition or limitation
contemplated in this Section 5.6, that would, or would reasonably be expected
to, have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results or operations,
EBITDA, or financial condition of either (x) Parent and its Subsidiaries or
(y) the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case of (x) and (y), measured on
a scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or
(ii) the benefits or advantages Parent expects to receive from the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(e)The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all registrations, filings,
notifications, communications, submissions and any other actions contemplated
by Section 5.4 or this Section 5.6, and, subject to applicable legal
limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep each
other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of any notices or other communications received by the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect
to such transactions. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed notifications or filings and any written or oral
communications or submissions, and with respect to any such notification,
filing, written communication or submission, any documents submitted therewith
to any Governmental Entity; provided, however, that materials may be redacted
(x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties with respect
thereto, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual agreements and (z) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees not to participate in any meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.



(f)In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in all respects with each other and
shall use all their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any such Action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Action, decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

Section 5.7Takeover Statutes. For any "fair price," "moratorium," "business
combination," "control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover
statute or regulation that is applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute
or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties hereto and
any Shares.



Section 5.8Public Announcements. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
consult with and provide each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to
the issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Entity; provided that the
restrictions in this Section 5.8 shall not apply to any Company communication
regarding an Alternative Proposal or from and after a Change of Recommendation
in compliance with Section 5.3. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint
press release in a form agreed by them as the first public disclosure of this
Agreement.



Section 5.9Indemnification and Insurance.



(a)Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or
bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue at and after the Effective Time in full force and
effect. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company\'s and
any Company Subsidiary\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such Action or resolution of
such claim, even if beyond such six-year period. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be jointly and severally liable for, and guaranty and stand
surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants
contained in this Section 5.9.



(b)The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing or any related expenses) each current and former director, officer
or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who
served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (each, together with such Person\'s heirs, executors or
administrators, and successors and assigns, an "Indemnified Party") against
any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys\' fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an
"Action"), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons
serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary in any entity if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or its
Subsidiaries). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Action.



(c)For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time; provided, however, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall
not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. In lieu
of the foregoing, at the Company\'s option, the Company may purchase (subject
to reasonable consultation with Parent), prior to the Effective Time, a six-
year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby. If such prepaid "tail" policy has been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.



(d)Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys\'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9.



(e)The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and
not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under
the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification arrangement, the IBCL or otherwise. The provisions of this
Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are
intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.



(f)In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.9.



Section 5.10Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Company\'s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.



Section 5.11Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.



Section 5.12Transaction Litigation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent of all (i) notices and other communications
received by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or Parent and (ii) Actions commenced or threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case in connection
with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement ("Transaction Litigation")
(including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and
thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.
The Company shall (a) give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b)
consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of
any Transaction Litigation and not settle or compromise any Transaction
Litigation without consent of Parent. For purposes of this Section 5.12,
"participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and
other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the
Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company
and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected). 

Section 5.13FIRPTA. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form
provided for in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h),
certifying that interests in the Company (including the Shares) are not United
States real property interests within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the
Code.



Section 5.14Convertible Notes. The Company shall comply with its obligations
under the Convertible Notes that arise as a result of the execution, delivery
or performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the delivery of any notices,
certificates and opinions required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.



Section 5.15Repatriation. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts (in the manner reasonably requested in writing
by Parent) to distribute or transfer or cause to be distributed or
transferred, immediately before Closing (including pursuant to the repayment
of outstanding intercompany obligations), unrestricted cash balances held in
commercial bank accounts in the name of the Company or such Subsidiary in any
jurisdiction located outside the United States to accounts in the name of the
Company or a Subsidiary located in the United States; provided, however, the
foregoing shall not require the Company to violate any applicable Law or incur
any Tax liability with respect to repatriation in advance of the Effective
Time unless the conditions to Closing have been waived or satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing).



Section 5.16Parent Financing.

(a)(i) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments (taking into account any "market flex" provisions in the related
fee letter) or on terms and conditions that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Parent Parties (as determined by the Parent Parties in good
faith) than the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing
Commitments (taking into account any "market flex" provisions in the related
fee letter), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Debt Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by the
Parent Parties, to obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis (taking into
account the timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions to funding in the
Debt Financing Commitments that are within the control of the Parent Parties,
(iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on
terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments (taking into
account any "market flex" provisions in the related fee letter) at or prior to
the Closing on terms and conditions that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Parent Parties (as determined by the Parent Parties in good
faith) than terms contained in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any
"market flex" provisions in the related fee letter); provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the documentation relating to the
bridge loan facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments shall
not be required until reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of
the Debt Financing, (iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing
Commitments and (v) in the event that all conditions in the Debt Financing
Commitments have been satisfied or waived, use reasonable best efforts to
cause the lenders party to the Debt Financing Commitments to fund on the
Closing Date the Debt Financing necessary to fund, in part, the Required
Amount (which may include litigation pursued in good faith). To the extent
reasonably requested by the Company from time to time, Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) and, upon the reasonable
request of the Company, Parent shall provide to the Company copies of the
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing)
for the purpose of monitoring the progress of the financing activities. 

(ii)In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including after giving effect to the exercise of any
"market flex" provisions in the related fee letter) contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments for any reason, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the
Company in writing and (B) Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause
their respective subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to arrange
to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount, when
added with the available portion of the Debt Financing and cash on hand at the
Parent Parties and their subsidiaries and cash on hand at the Company and its
subsidiaries, sufficient to fund the Required Amount (the "Alternative
Financing") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
on terms and conditions (taking into account any "market flex" provisions in
the related fee letter) that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Parent Parties (as determined by the Parent Parties in good faith) than the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into
account any "market flex" provisions in the related fee letter). If
applicable, except as otherwise expressly stated, references in this Agreement
to the terms "Debt Financing Commitments" and "Debt Financing" shall include
any Alternative Financing.



(iii)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company in writing (A) if a Debt Financing Commitment expires or is
terminated in either case for any reason prior to its stated date of
expiration or termination (or if any Person attempts or purports in writing to
terminate a Debt Financing Commitment prior to the stated date of termination,
whether or not such attempted or purported early termination is valid), (B) if
there exists any material breach, material default, repudiation, cancellation
or early termination by any Lender (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any material breach, material default, repudiation, cancellation or
early termination) of which Parent becomes aware and that would, in any such
case, reasonably be expected to adversely affect the timely availability
(taking into account the timing of the Marketing Period) or the amount of the
Debt Financing, (C) of the receipt by the Parent Parties or Merger Sub of any
written notice or other written communication from any Lender with respect to
any (I) actual material breach, material default, repudiation, cancellation or
early termination by such Lender that would, in any such case, reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the timely availability (taking into account the
timing of the Marketing Period) or the amount of the Debt Financing or (II)
material dispute or disagreement between the Parent Parties and any Lender
related to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt
Financing to be funded at Closing (but excluding for the avoidance of doubt,
any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt
Financing and/or the definitive agreements with respect thereto) or (D) if for
any reason the Parent Parties or Merger Sub believe in good faith that there
is a reasonable possibility that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments.
As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company and that is reasonably available to the
Parent Parties relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or
(C) of the immediately preceding sentence.



(iv)Parent Parties shall not (without the prior written consent of the
Company) consent or agree to any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Financing
Commitments if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver
(1) decreases the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount that,
when combined with cash on hand at the Parent Parties and their subsidiaries
and cash on hand at the Company and its subsidiaries, would or would
reasonably be expected to be less than the Required Amount, or (2) imposes new
or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in the case of this clause
(2), in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent, delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur, or (C)
materially adversely impact the ability of the Parent Parties to enforce its
rights against the Lenders under the Debt Financing Commitments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Parent Parties may amend, replace, supplement and/or modify the Debt Financing
Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents,
commitment parties, purchasers or similar entities as parties thereto who had
not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof. Upon any
amendment, supplement, replacement or modification of the Debt Financing
Commitments made in compliance with this Section 5.16(a), Parent shall provide
a copy thereof to the Company and the terms "Debt Financing Commitments" and
"Debt Financing" shall mean the Debt Financing Commitments and the Debt
Financing as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified, including any
Alternative Financing.



(v)Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this Section
5.16(a) shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Debt Financing is available and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are not
contingent on Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to obtain the Debt Financing
(or any Alternative Financing) or any specific term with respect to such
financing.



(vi)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Section 5.16(a) shall require, and in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent and Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, Parent or Merger Sub to pay any fees or agree to pay any interest
rate amounts, in either case, in excess of those contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments (taking into account any "market flex" provisions
contained in the related fee letter) or to consummate the Debt Financing prior
to the completion of the Marketing Period.



(b)Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries
to and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
officers, directors and employees to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, direct its and their respective accountants, legal counsel and
other Representatives to, provide to the Parent Parties and Merger Sub, at the
Parent Parties' sole cost and expense, all customary cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing (solely for purposes of this Section 5.11(b), the term "Debt
Financing" shall be deemed to include one or more offerings of customary "high
yield" non-convertible debt securities to be issued or incurred in lieu of any
bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments or pursuant to
any "market flex" or "securities demand" provisions of the related fee letter)
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments; provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries, including: 

(i)as promptly as reasonably practicable, (A) furnishing Parent with the
Required Information and such other financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company and its subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or the Lenders to assist in the preparation of any syndication,
offering or other similar marketing materials and/or documents related to the
Debt Financing and (B) informing Parent if the Company shall have actual
Knowledge of any facts that would likely require the restatement of any
financial statements included in the Required Information for such financial
statements to comply with GAAP;



(ii)assisting the Parent Parties in preparation for, and participating with
the Parent Parties in, the marketing efforts for the Debt Financing, including
participating with, and causing senior members of management and
Representatives of the Company and its subsidiaries to participate with, the

notwithstanding, if (i) the Company shall have validly terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i), (ii) Parent shall have validly
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(ii) or (iii) (A) after

expenses of enforcement (including attorneys\' fees as well as expenses
incurred in connection with any action initiated by such party), together with
interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee at the prime lending
rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such

Company Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty but is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision. If this Agreement is terminated in circumstances
where the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section 7.3,
then following receipt by the Parent of the Company Termination Fee, the
Company Termination Fee (i) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any
and all damages against the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
former, current or future officers, directors, partners, shareholders,
managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives arising out of, related to
this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith, any
breach by the 

Company of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and any claims or actions arising out of the
foregoing, and (ii) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
former, current or future officers, directors, partners, shareholders,
managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives and none of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members, Affiliates or
Representatives for any losses suffered as a result of this Agreement, any
contract or agreement executed in connection herewith, any breach of this
Agreement or the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be consummated, and none of the foregoing Persons shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The parties acknowledge that the right to
receive the Company Termination Fee shall not limit or otherwise affect any
such party\'s right to specific performance as provided in Section 8.5.



Section 7.4Parent Termination Fee.



(a)Parent Termination Fee. Any provision in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, if the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement
pursuant to (i) Section 7.1(e), or (ii) Section 7.1(h), then Parent shall pay,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
the Company, a fee of $86 million in cash (the "Parent Termination Fee"), such
payment to be made within three Business Days of such termination; it being
understood that in no event shall the Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Upon the payment by the Parent of
the Parent Termination Fee as and when required by this Section 7.4(a),
together with any reimbursement owed for any Recoverable Amounts, the Parent
and the Specified Persons shall have no further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to the Company or their
respective Affiliates or Representatives.



(b)Acknowledgements. Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.4 are an integral part of this Agreement and that, without
Section 7.4(a), the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this
Section 7.4, Parent shall pay to the Company all fees, costs and expenses of
enforcement (including attorneys\' fees as well as expenses incurred in
connection with any action initiated by such party), together with interest on
the amount of the Parent Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such payment is
required to be made. The parties further acknowledge that the Parent
Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that (i) will compensate the Company in the circumstances in
which Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, (ii) shall
be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages against the
Specified Persons arising out of, related to this Agreement, any contract or
agreement executed in connection herewith (including the Debt Commitment
Letter), any breach by the Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement, the failure
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and any claims
or actions arising out of the foregoing, and (iii) shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Company and its Affiliates for damages against Parent,
Merger Sub and the former, current or future, direct or indirect,
equityholders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective successors or assigns, or any current or future
equityholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent,
Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner or of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Specified Persons"), for any losses suffered as
a result of this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection
herewith (including the Debt Commitment Letter), any 

breach of this Agreement or the failure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated, and upon payment in full of the Parent
Termination Fee, none of the Specified Persons shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except, in the
case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), (A) for the obligations of Greeneden U.S.
Holdings II, LLC under the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) for the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub for any reimbursement or indemnification
owed to the Company pursuant to Section 5.16(c) (any amounts owed pursuant to
clauses (A) and (B), collectively, the "Recoverable Amounts"). For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event the Closing does not occur, in no event shall
the Specified Persons be subject to (nor shall the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or any of their Affiliates seek to recover) monetary damages in
excess of the Parent Termination Fee for any losses arising from or in
connection with breaches by the Parent or Merger Sub of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement or arising from any Action in law or equity that the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or any of their Affiliates may have for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated. The parties acknowledge that, until such time as this Agreement
is validly terminated and Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee, the right to
receive the Parent Termination Fee shall not limit or otherwise affect any
such party\'s right to specific performance as provided in Section 8.5. For
the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted
or entitled to obtain specific performance as provided in Section 8.5 and also
any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.
