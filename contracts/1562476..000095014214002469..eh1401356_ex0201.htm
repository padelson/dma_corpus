---|--- 
 

  

  

Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to Seller:

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

if any representation and warranty of Seller or Guarantor contained in this
Agreement fails to be true and accurate or is breached such that any of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.1(a)(i) or 6.1(a)(ii) would not be
satisfied or Seller or Guarantor breaches, or fails to comply with, its
covenants, agreements or obligations contained in this Agreement such that the
condition set forth in Section 6.1(a)(iii) would not be satisfied, and, in
each case, such failure or breach either cannot be cured or continues uncured
for 10 Business Days (or until the Termination Date, if earlier) after the
date on which Purchaser provides Seller with written notice of such failure or
breach; provided, however, that if Seller can reasonably expect to cure such
failure or breach prior to the Termination Date (and Seller confirms in
writing to Purchaser that Seller is continuing to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such failure or breach to be cured), Purchaser may
not terminate this Agreement on account of such failure or breach prior to the
Termination Date (and then, Purchaser may only terminate this Agreement to the
extent that such failure or breach is not cured on or before the Termination
Date); or

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

upon the Termination Date, if Competition Act Approval has not been obtained

\- 61 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

     |  

  |  

prior to the Termination Date to extend the Termination Date by up to 30 days
(and it being agreed that five Business Days prior to the Termination Date,
Purchaser shall advise Seller in writing whether it elects to postpone the
Termination Date, failing which Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived its
option to extend) provided, however, that the maximum aggregate number of days
of extension past the Termination Date under this Section 6.2(b) and Section
6.4(b) shall be 30; or

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

if any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 (other than those conditions
which by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at Closing and
other than those covered in Section 6.2(a)), have not been satisfied in all
material respects or waived or will be impossible or impractical to satisfy,
with the use of commercial reasonable efforts, on or prior to the Termination
Date,

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

in each case, provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement if the failure or impossibility of satisfaction of
the condition was as a result of a breach by Purchaser or Parent of any of its
covenants, agreements or obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

Upon termination of this Agreement by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.2,
each of Purchaser and Parent shall be released from all of its obligations
under this Agreement; provided, however, that the following provisions shall
survive: this Section 6.2, Section 7.7 (Confidentiality), Section 7.8

shall not relieve any Party from liability for fraud or willful breach or for
any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to termination.

  

  

Purchaser\'s right of termination under this Section 6.2 is in addition to any
other rights it may have under this Agreement, and the exercise of a right of
termination will not be an election of remedies hereunder.

only as at a specific date, it only needs to be true and accurate as at that
date;

if any representation and warranty of Purchaser or Parent contained in this
Agreement fails to be true and accurate or is breached such that any of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.3(a)(i) or 6.3(a)(ii) would not be
satisfied or Purchaser or Parent breaches, or fails to comply with its
covenants, agreements and obligations contained in this Agreement such that
the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a)(iii) would not be satisfied, and, in
each case, such failure or breach either cannot be cured or continues uncured

receiving access to such Books and Records. Furthermore, Purchaser shall not
destroy any Books and Records which relate or could reasonably be expected to
relate to Separately-Indemnified Damages without the written consent of Seller

Acquired Companies that are due after the Closing Date in respect of a Pre-
Adjustment Tax Period, which Tax Returns must be prepared and filed on a
timely basis consistent with each of the Acquired Companies\' existing
procedures for preparing Tax Returns and in a manner consistent with prior
practice with respect to treatment of specific items on the Tax Returns,
except as required by applicable Law. Purchaser will cause, at the sole
discretion of Seller, the Acquired Companies to make the Tax election under
subsection 256(9) of the Tax Act and the equivalent provision(s) of applicable
provincial legislation. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a draft of such
(i) income Tax Returns 30 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Returns with the appropriate taxing authorities, and (ii) any other Tax
Returns 10 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns with the
appropriate taxing authorities. Seller shall have the right to review the
draft of the Tax Returns provided to them by Purchaser and make any reasonable
comments that they deem appropriate, which comments shall be accepted by
Purchaser.

Refunds. Any refunds of Taxes (or credit for overpayment of Taxes) of any of
the Acquired Companies not taken into account and actually adjusted for in the
determination of the Purchase Price, as finally determined including any
interest actually received (or credited) with respect thereto, from the
applicable taxing authorities for any a Pre-Adjustment Tax Period (including
refunds arising from amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date) shall
be for the account of Seller and, if received by (or credited to) Purchaser or
any of the Acquired Companies shall be paid, net of any Tax costs incurred or
accrued on account of the receipt of such refund by Purchaser or the Acquired
Companies and any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with
such receipt, to Seller within 10 calendar days after Purchaser or any of the
Acquired Companies receives such refund (or is credited with such over
payment). At the request of Seller, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired
Companies to pursue claims for refunds for any Pre-Adjustment Tax Periods.

which any Acquired Company becomes entitled, that arises as a result of the
carry-back of a loss, credit, deduction or allowance from a Post-Adjustment
Tax Period shall be for the account of Purchaser and the applicable Acquired
Company shall be entitled to retain such refund (or credit) and any amounts
(including interest) received thereon.

Straddle Period Tax Allocation. All Taxes (and refunds) with respect to any
Acquired Company that relate to a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between
the portion of such period ending on the Adjustment Date and the portion of
such period beginning after the Adjustment Date in the following manner: (i)
in the case of Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, sales,
gross receipts, wages, capital expenditures, expenses, withholding Taxes or
any similar Tax base, the amount of Tax allocable to a portion of the Straddle
Period shall be the total amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such
portion of such Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in such Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to incomes, sales, gross receipts, wages, capital
expenditures, expenses, withholding Taxes or any similar Tax base, the amount
of such Tax that is allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period that ends
on the Adjustment Date shall be deemed to be equal to the amount that would be
payable if the relevant Straddle Period had ended on the close of business on
the Adjustment Date.

the Guarantor and Seller deal at arm\'s length with Purchaser; (ii) no

permitted to make changes to employee compensation within such 12 month period
with the consent of the affected Employees or Seller, such consent by Seller
not to be unreasonably withheld.

in the case of any Third Party Claim that does not relate to Separately-
Indemnified Damages, such Third Party Claim seeks only monetary damages and
does not (A) seek any injunctive or other relief against any Indemnified
Person or (B) in the view of the Indemnified Person, acting reasonably,

involves potential reputational damage, non-monetary penalty or admission of
fault or liability on the part of such Persons;

  |  

(iii)

  |  

in the case of any Third Party Claim that relates to Separately-Indemnified
Damages, if such Third Party Claim, (A) seeks any injunctive or other relief
against an Indemnified Person or (B) in the view of Parent, acting reasonably,
adversely affects it or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies and
Non-Controlled Joint Ventures following Closing) or Representatives in any way
that involves potential reputational damage, non-monetary penalty or admission
of fault or liability on the part of such Persons, then Parent shall have the
right, at its own cost and expense, to appoint its own counsel and participate
in the defense of such Third Party Claim, and Seller cannot compromise or
settle such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;

  |  

(vi)

  |  

except with respect to any Third Party Claim relating to Separately-

(b)

  |  

If the Indemnifying Party fails to give notice of its intention to participate
in any Third Party Claim not relating to Separately-Indemnified Damages in
accordance with this Section 8.7, then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed
to have waived its right to participate in such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not the obligation) to undertake
the defence of such Third Party Claim, employ its own counsel, and compromise
and settle such Third Party Claim on behalf, for the account and at the risk
and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provided that it is kept reasonably
apprised of the status of the same.

  |  

(c)

  |  

Where the defence of a Third Party Claim is being undertaken and controlled by
the Indemnifying Party, including any Third Party Claim relating to
Separately-Indemnified Damages, the Indemnified Person will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make available any Books and Records or
other information relevant to such Third Party Claim, including any
correspondence relating to such Third Party Claim received by an Indemnified
Person, which correspondence shall be transmitted to the Indemnifying Person
without delay, and (ii) make available to the Indemnifying Party or its
Representatives those employees whose assistance, testimony or presence is
necessary to assist the Indemnifying Party in evaluating and defending any
such claims at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(d)

  |  

If the Indemnifying Party participates in the defence of a Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Person will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in evaluating and participating in the
defence of such claim.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(e)

  |  

Seller shall control the prosecution of any claim of indemnification available
to the Purchased Indemnified Person under the Specified Contract and no
Purchaser Indemnified Person shall take any action to exercise such
indemnification right other than at and in strict compliance with the written
instruction of Seller.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(f)

  |  

If any Purchaser Indemnified Person receives an amount pursuant to the
Specified Contract in respect of Separately-Indemnified Damages, and the

(a)

  |  

Prior to Closing, each of Seller, Guarantors, Purchaser and Parent expressly
acknowledge that, the failure to perform or comply with a covenant, agreement
or obligation contained in this Agreement may give rise to irreparable injury
to the other Parties which may be inadequately compensable in damages and
nothing in this Agreement shall limit any Party\'s right to seek and obtain an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of this Agreement without proof of actual damage
(and without the requirement of posting any bond or other type of security).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

After Closing, the indemnities provided in this Article 8 constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of Purchaser and Seller against the other in the event of
any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty or failure to perform
any covenant or obligation of such Party contained in this Agreement (other
than a claim involving fraud, willful misconduct or fraudulent
misrepresentation or a claim under Sections 7.5 or 7.7).

warranty for the purposes of Section 8.1(a)(ii) or 8.2(a)(ii) and (ii)
calculating the amount of damages arising therefrom, the terms "material" and
"materially" shall be disregarded such that a breach, non-compliance or

A Notice is deemed to be given and received (i) if sent by personal delivery
or same day courier, facsimile or electronic mail (with confirmed receipt), on
the date of delivery if it is a Business Day and the delivery was made prior
to 5:00 p.m. (local time in place of receipt) and otherwise on the next
Business Day, or (ii) if sent by overnight courier, on the next Business Day.
A Party may change its address for service from time to time by providing a
Notice in accordance with the foregoing. Any subsequent Notice must be sent to
the Party at its changed address. Any element of a Party\'s address that is
not specifically changed in a Notice will be assumed not to be changed.

is for information purposes only and does not constitute delivery of the
Notice to that Party. The failure to send a copy of a Notice to legal counsel
does not invalidate delivery of that Notice to a Party.

Announcements.

Unless required by Law, a Governmental Entity, or, in the case of Parent, to
comply with its reporting obligations to holders of its outstanding
indebtedness, no press release, public statement or announcement or other
public disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein may be made except with the prior written consent and
joint approval of Seller and Purchaser. Where the public disclosure is
required by Law or by a Governmental Entity, the Party required to make the
public disclosure will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
approval of the other Parties as to the form, nature and extent of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 81 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the disclosure, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided, however, that (i) the Parties acknowledge and agree that Seller\'s
ultimate parent is a public issuer and as such will be required by Law or by a
Governmental Entity (including any securities legislation and rules of any
applicable stock exchange) to make public statements, announcements and other
public disclosure with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein, which statements, announcements and other disclosure may
include certain terms and conditions regarding such transactions, including
disclosure as to the consideration to be paid by Purchaser, and (ii) prior
written consent and joint approval of Seller and Purchaser is not required for
the public disclosure of any information that is in the public domain.

Third Party Beneficiaries.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.14 and for the Indemnified Persons,
the Parties intend that this Agreement shall not benefit or create any right
or cause of action in, or on behalf of, any Person other than the Parties and
no Person, other than the Parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to rely
on the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding, hearing
or other forum. The provisions of (a) Section 8.1 are intended for the benefit
of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons, and (b) Section 8.2 are intended for the
benefit of the Seller Indemnified Persons, in each case, as and to the extent
applicable in accordance with their terms; and these provisions shall be
enforceable by each of such Persons and his heirs, executors, administrators
and other legal representatives or its successors and permitted assigns
(collectively the "Third Party Beneficiaries"). Each of Purchaser, in respect
of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and Seller, in respect of the Seller
Indemnified Persons, shall hold the rights and benefits of Sections 8.1 and
8.2, respectively, in trust for and on behalf of the Third Party Beneficiaries
and hereby accepts such trust and agrees to hold the benefit of and enforce
performance of such covenants on behalf of the Third Party Beneficiaries.

  

  

    

9.5

  |  

Conflicts and Privilege.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that Seller has retained Stikeman
Elliott LLP ("SE") to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein. Purchaser agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises
after Closing between Purchaser and Seller, SE may represent Seller in such
dispute even though the interests of Seller may be directly adverse to any of
Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and the Non-Controlled Joint Ventures, and
even though SE may have represented any of the Acquired Companies and the Non-
Controlled Joint Ventures in a matter substantially related to such dispute,
or may be handling ongoing matters for Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and
the Non-Controlled Joint Ventures. Purchaser further agrees that, as to all
communications among SE, the Acquired Companies, the Non-Controlled Joint
Ventures, Seller and Guarantor that relate in any way to the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, the attorney or solicitor-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may be controlled
by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by any of Purchaser, the
Acquired Companies and the Non-Controlled Joint Ventures. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies or the Non-Controlled Joint Ventures and a third party other than a
party to this Agreement after Closing, the Acquired Companies and the Non-
Controlled Joint Ventures may assert the attorney or solicitor-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by SE to such
third party, provided, however, that the Acquired

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 82 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Companies and the Non-Controlled Joint Ventures may not waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of Seller.

  

  

    

9.6

  |  

Expenses.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, including in Section
5.9(b), Purchaser will pay for its own fees and expenses and Seller shall pay
for its own fees and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
and the agreements contemplated by it, including the fees and expenses of
legal counsel, investment advisers and accountants.

  

  

    

9.7

  |  

Amendments.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

This Agreement may only be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified by
written agreement signed by each of the Parties.

  

  

    

9.8

  |  

Waiver.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar), nor shall
such waiver be binding unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by
the waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any Party to exercise any right
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise of such right or the exercise of any other right.

  

  

    

9.9

  |  

Non-Merger.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the covenants,
representations and warranties shall not merge on and shall survive the
Closing.

  

  

    

9.10

  |  

Entire Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

This Agreement together with the agreements referred to herein constitute the
entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
Parties, including the LOI. There are no representations, warranties,
covenants, conditions or other agreements, express or implied, collateral,
statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in connection with the subject
matter of this Agreement and the agreements referred to herein except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement and neither Party has relied or is
relying on any other information, discussion or understanding in entering into
and completing the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

  

  

    

9.11

  |  

Successors and Assigns.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

This Agreement shall become effective when executed and delivered by the
Parties and after that time shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 83 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

9.12

  |  

Assignment.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations under this
Agreement shall be assignable or transferable by any Party without the prior
written consent of the other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
may assign this Agreement or any and all rights or obligations hereunder to an
Affiliate, provided that Parent remain liable for the obligations of Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

    

9.13

  |  

Severability.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision
shall be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions shall
continue in full force and effect. The Parties shall engage in good faith
negotiations to replace any provision of this Agreement which is declared
illegal, invalid or unenforceable with a legal, valid and enforceable
provision, the economic effect of which shall come as close as possible to
that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision which it replaces.

  

  

    

9.14

  |  

Governing Law.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance
with the Laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal Laws of Canada
applicable therein. Each Party irrevocably attorns and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Ontario courts situated in the City of Toronto
and waives objection to the venue of any proceeding in such court or that such
court provides an inconvenient forum.

Counterparts.

counterparts by facsimile or PDF email) and all such counterparts taken
together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.
