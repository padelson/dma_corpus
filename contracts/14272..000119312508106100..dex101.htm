parties shall be entitled to equitable relief, without the proof of actual damages, including in the form of an injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance (including causing Purchaser to enforce its rights under any of the
Financing Letters), in addition to all other remedies available to the parties at law or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Each party agrees to (a)&nbsp;cooperate fully in any attempt by the other party in obtaining any
such equitable remedy and (b)&nbsp;waive any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy. Each party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action
for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement. Such equitable remedies may be sought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County (and, if such
