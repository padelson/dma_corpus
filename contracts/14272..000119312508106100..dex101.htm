v STOCK AND ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of May 2, 2008 (this "
_Agreement_ "), between BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation
(" _Seller_ "), and CIDRON HEALTHCARE LIMITED, a Jersey limited company ("
_Purchaser_ ").

Seller desires to sell, and Purchaser desires to purchase, the ConvaTec
business of Seller, the Selling Affiliates (such term and each other defined
term used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement having the meaning
given it in Section 12.07(b)) and the Transferred Entities, as conducted on
the date hereof consisting of (i) the manufacture, distribution, marketing and
sale of the Products (and any other products resulting from the research,
development, products design and related activities described in clause (ii)
below) and (ii) the research, development, products design and related
activities of Seller, the Selling Affiliates and the Transferred Entities to
the extent related solely to the Products and such other wound and
professional skin care products for wound care (excluding any pharmaceutical,
over-the-counter or other dermatological or skin care products manufactured,
distributed, marketed or sold in connection with any business of Seller and
its controlled Affiliates other than the ConvaTec business) and related
supplies and accessories, ostomy systems and devices and related supplies
and accessories and acute fecal incontinence systems and devices and related
supplies and accessories (including, in each case, any adjacent technologies)
as are in development as of the date hereof or on the Closing Date (the "
_Business_ ").

Seller or a Selling Affiliate is the direct owner of the equity interests set
forth opposite its name in each of the entities set forth above Seller or
such Selling Affiliates name in Section B of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(such entities are collectively referred to as the " _Purchased Companies_ "
and such equity interests are collectively referred to as the " _Purchased
Companies  Equity Interests_").

Each applicable Purchased Company is directly the owner of the equity
interests set forth opposite its name in each of the entities listed above
such Purchased Companys name in Section B of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(such entities are collectively referred to as the " _Purchased Company
Subsidiaries_ " and such equity interests are collectively referred to as the
" _Purchased Company Subsidiaries  Equity Interests_").

Seller, the Selling Affiliates, the Purchased Companies and the Purchased
Company Subsidiaries conduct the Business (the Purchased Companies and
the Purchased Company Subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the "
_Transferred Entities_ ").

At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Seller and each of the Selling Affiliates desire to sell and
transfer to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to purchase and accept from
Seller and the Selling Affiliates, the Purchased Companies Equity Interests,
the Acquired Assets and the Acquired Liabilities (the " _Acquisition_ ").

Immediately after the Closing, Purchaser will (a) directly or indirectly own
the Purchased Companies Equity Interests and the Acquired Assets, (b) be
responsible for the Assumed Liabilities and (c) indirectly own the Purchased
Company Subsidiaries Equity Interests (the Purchased Companies Equity
Interests and the Purchased Company Subsidiaries Equity Interests are
collectively referred to as the " _Transferred Equity Interests_ ").

 Accordingly, the parties hereby agree as follows:

and the Selling Affiliates in, to and under the Purchased Companies Equity
Interests and the Acquired Assets for (i) the Purchase Price, payable and
subject to adjustment as set forth in Article II, and (ii) Purchasers
assumption of the Acquired Liabilities and its agreement to cause all Assumed

be reasonably agreed by Seller and Purchaser.

(c) The purchase and sale of the International Transferred Shares of each

the requirements of applicable local Law, (iii) such changes as may be
reasonably agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser regarding employees and

be consistent with the principles underlying the corresponding provisions of
this Agreement and (iv) such other changes as may be reasonably agreed by

Transaction Document or any right or alleged right to indemnification
hereunder. It is expressly understood and agreed that notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything in this Agreement or in any Other Transaction Document
to the contrary, the parties right to indemnification under Article X or
elsewhere in this Agreement or in any Other Transaction Document shall in no
way be limited, impaired or superceded because a Liability that gives rise to
a claim for indemnification under Article X or elsewhere in this Agreement or
in any Other Transaction Document may otherwise constitute an Assumed
Liability or a Retained Liability, as the case may be, and that Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, shall be entitled to pursue all rights and
remedies in respect of any such Liability as set forth in this Agreement or
any applicable Other Transaction Document.

SECTION 1.04. _Risk of Loss._ Until the Closing, any loss of or damage to the

Purchaser, and Purchaser shall thereafter bear all risk of loss associated
with the assets of the Transferred Entities and the Acquired Assets and
be solely responsible for procuring adequate insurance to protect the assets
of the Transferred Entities and the Acquired Assets against any such loss.

SECTION 1.05. _Consents of Third Parties._ (a) Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign, directly or indirectly, any asset (including any
Contract, Permit or Environmental Permit), claim or right, or any benefit
arising under or resulting from such asset, claim or right, if an attempted
direct or indirect assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party,
would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of such third
party, would be ineffective with respect to any  



 

9  party to an agreement concerning such asset, claim or right or would in any
way adversely affect the contractual rights of Seller, any Selling Affiliate
or the Transferred Entities or, upon transfer, Purchaser under such asset,
claim or right. If any direct or indirect transfer or assignment by Seller,
any Selling Affiliate or any Transferred Entity to, or any direct or indirect
assumption by Purchaser of, any interest in, or liability, obligation or
commitment under, any asset, claim or right requires the consent of a third
party, then such transfer, assignment or assumption shall be made subject to
such consent being obtained.

(b) If any such consent referred to in Section 1.05(a) (including any such
consent necessary or required in order for Seller and its Affiliates
to comply with and be able to perform in accordance with the terms of the
Transitional Services Agreement and any consent required by any Governmental
Entity to the transfer of Business Employees to Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser) is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall
nonetheless take place and, thereafter, Seller and the Selling Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall cooperate in any lawful
and reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Purchaser (not including
the payment of any consideration) under which Purchaser shall obtain the
economic claims, rights and benefits under, and shall bear all the costs,
liabilities and burdens with respect to, the asset, claim or right with
respect to which the consent has not been obtained in accordance with this
Agreement; _provided_ that Purchaser shall pay or satisfy all the costs,
expenses, obligations and liabilities incurred by Seller or the Selling
Affiliates in connection with any such alternative arrangements (other than
legal fees incurred by Seller and the Selling Affiliates in connection with
documenting and negotiating such arrangement, which shall be borne by Seller).
This Section 1.05(b) does not relate to the transfer of Permits and
Environmental Permits, which are addressed solely by Section 8.02(c).

SECTION 1.06.  _Refunds and Remittances._ (a) _Received by Seller or the
Selling Affiliates._ After the Closing, if Seller or any of its Affiliates
receives (i) any refund or other amount which is an Acquired Asset or is
otherwise properly due and owing to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Entities) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or (ii) any refund or other amount which is related to claims or
other matters for which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) is responsible hereunder, and which amount is not an
Excluded Asset, or is otherwise properly due and owing to Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, Seller promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be
remitted, such amount to Purchaser at the address set forth in Section
12.06(a).

(b) _Received by Purchaser or its Affiliates._ After the Closing, if Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates receives (i) any refund or other amount which is an
Excluded Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing to Seller or any of the
Selling Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) any
refund or other amount which is related to claims or other matters for which
Seller is responsible hereunder, and which amount is not an Acquired Asset,
or is otherwise properly due and owing to Seller or any of the Selling
Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser promptly
shall remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to Seller at the
address set forth in Section 12.06(b).

SECTION 2.02. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment._ (a) Within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a
statement (the " _Statement_ ") setting forth (i) Working Capital as of the
effective time of the Closing on the Closing Date (" _Closing Working Capital_
") determined in a manner consistent and in accordance with the Working
Capital Principles, (ii) Retained Cash and (iii) Indebtedness of the
Transferred Entities as of the effective time of the Closing on the Closing
Date (" _Closing Indebtedness_ "). For purposes of preparing the Statement,
the determination of Inventory shall be based on the amounts recorded in the
books and records of the Business as of such time in accordance with the
Working Capital Principles.

(b) During the forty-five (45)-day period following Purchasers receipt of the
Statement, Purchaser and its independent auditors shall be permitted to
review the working papers of Seller relating to the Statement. The Statement
shall become final and binding upon the parties on the forty-fifth (45th) day
following delivery thereof, unless Purchaser gives written notice to Seller of
its disagreement with the Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") prior to
such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail
the nature of any disagreement so asserted, (ii) include only
disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on Closing Working
Capital not being calculated in accordance with this Section 2.02 or Retained
Cash or Closing Indebtedness not being calculated in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and (iii) specify the amount that Purchaser
reasonably believes is the correct amount of the Closing Working Capital,
Retained Cash and/or Closing Indebtedness based on the disagreements set forth
in the Notice of Disagreement, including a reasonably detailed description of
the adjustments applied to the Statement in calculating such amount. If the
Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller in a timely manner, then the
Statement (as revised in accordance with this Section 2.02) shall become
final and binding on the parties on the earlier of (i) the date Seller and
Purchaser resolve in writing all differences they have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date
all disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm.
During the forty-five (45)-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement and agree on a final determination of
Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash and/or Closing Indebtedness. During
such period, Seller and its independent auditors shall be permitted to review
the working papers of Purchaser and its independent auditors relating to the
Notice of Disagreement; _provided_ that Seller and its advisors, including its
independent auditors, shall have executed all release letters reasonably
requested by Purchasers independent auditors in connection therewith. At the
end of such forty-five (45)-day period, if no agreement on Closing Working
Capital, Retained Cash and Closing Indebtedness has been reached, Seller and
Purchaser shall submit to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm
(the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for arbitration any and all matters that remain in
dispute and that were properly included  



 

13  in the Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting Firm shall be the New York
office of Ernst and Young LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to
act, such other nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as
shall be agreed upon by the parties hereto in writing or, if the parties are
unable to so agree in writing within ten (10) days after the end of such
forty-five (45)-day period, then Purchaser and Seller shall each select such
a firm and such firms shall jointly select a third nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm to resolve the disputed matters. The
parties shall jointly instruct the Accounting Firm that it (i) shall review
only the matters that were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement and
which remain in dispute, (ii) shall make its determination in accordance with
the requirements of this Section 2.02 and (iii) shall render its written
decision as promptly as practicable but in no event later than forty-five (45)
days after submission to the Accounting Firm of all matters in dispute.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any
court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is
to be enforced. The Accounting Firms determination shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the Accounting Firm that it reached its decision in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 2.02(b). The cost of any arbitration
(including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and reasonable
attorney fees and expenses of the parties) pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall
be borne by Purchaser and Seller in inverse proportion as they may prevail on
matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations also
shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of
the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The
fees, costs and expenses of Seller incurred in connection with its preparation
of the Statement, its review of any Notice of Disagreement and its preparation
of its written brief submitted to the Accounting Firm shall be borne by
Seller, and the fees, costs and expenses of Purchaser incurred in connection
with its review of the Statement, its preparation, review and certification of
the Notice of Disagreement and its preparation of its written brief submitted
to the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Purchaser.

(c) The Purchase Price shall be (i) increased by the amount by which (A)
Closing Working Capital exceeds (B) the sum of $156,900,000 (the " _2007
Balance Sheet Working Capital Amount_ ") and $40,000,000 (such sum, the "
_Target Working Capital_ "), and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
amount by which Closing Working Capital is less than the Target Working
Capital, (ii) increased by the amount of Retained Cash, if any, and (iii)
decreased by the amount of the Closing Indebtedness, if any. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.02(c), no adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.02(c) shall be made unless such
adjustment would exceed $1,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
payment would exceed $1,000,000, then the full amount of such adjustment shall
be made. The Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.02(c) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Final Purchase Price_ ". If the Closing
Date Amount is less than the Final Purchase Price, Purchaser shall, and if the
Final Purchase Price is less than the Closing Date Amount, Seller shall,
within ten (10) business days after the Statement becomes final and binding on
the parties, make payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds of
the amount of such difference, together with interest thereon at a rate equal
to the Prime Rate from (and including) the Closing Date to (but not including)
the date of payment.

(d) The term " _Working Capital_ " means Current Assets minus Current
Liabilities. The term " _Current Assets_ " means without duplication (i) the
receivables (net of allowances), net inventories, prepaid expenses and other
current assets of the Transferred Entities and (ii)(A) the  



 

14  receivables, net of allowances, of Seller and its Affiliates arising out of
or related to the Business (but only to the extent included in the
Transferred Accounts Receivable), (B) the inventories, net of reserves of
Seller and its Affiliates arising out of or related to the Business (but only
to the extent included in Transferred Inventory), (C) the prepaid expenses of
Seller and its Affiliates arising out of or related to the Business (but only
to the extent included in the Transferred Miscellaneous Rights) and (D) the
other current assets of Seller and its Affiliates arising out of or related to
the Business (but only to the extent included in the Acquired Assets), in
each case calculated in the same manner, using the same methods and, to the
extent applicable, the same foreign currency exchange rates, as the
corresponding line item from the 2007 Balance Sheet Working Capital Amount
set forth on Exhibit E hereto. The term " _Current Liabilities_ " means (i)
the accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued compensation, and accrued
rebates and returns of the Transferred Entities, and (ii)(A) the accounts
payable of Seller and its Affiliates arising out of or related to the Business
(but only to the extent included in the Assumed Accounts Payable), (B) the
accrued expenses of Seller and its Affiliates arising out of or related to
the Business (but only to the extent included in the Assumed Liabilities), (C)
the accrued compensation of Seller and its Affiliates arising out of or
related to the Business (but only to the extent included in the
Assumed Liabilities), and (D) the accrued rebates and returns of Seller and
its Affiliates arising out of or related to the Business (but only to the
extent included in the Assumed Liabilities), in each case calculated in the
same manner, using the same methods and, to the extent applicable, the same
foreign currency exchange rates, as the corresponding line item from the 2007
Balance Sheet Working Capital Amount set forth on Exhibit E hereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) current assets and current liabilities relating to
Cash other than Retained Cash, (ii) any assets or liabilities related to
Taxes, (iii) any assets or liabilities to the extent related to intercompany
receivables or payables, including intercompany interest, and (iv) any
liabilities related to accrued restructuring expenses shall not be taken into
account in determining Working Capital.

(e) Each line item of the Closing Working Capital (including any items
excluded from Closing Working Capital) shall be calculated in the same manner,
using the same methods and, to the extent applicable, the same foreign
currency exchange rates, as the corresponding line item of the calculation of
2007 Balance Sheet Working Capital Amount (or item excluded from 2007 Balance
Sheet Working Capital Amount) set forth on Exhibit E hereto was calculated,
whether or not doing so is in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except as otherwise
provided in Exhibit E hereto. The foregoing principles are referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Working Capital Principles_ ". The Purchase Price
adjustment contemplated by this Section 2.02 can only be effected as intended
by the parties if the calculation of the 2007 Balance Sheet Working Capital
Amount and the Closing Working Capital is done in the same manner, using the
same methods and, to the extent applicable, the same foreign currency
exchange rates, except as otherwise provided in Exhibit E hereto. The scope of
the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether
there were mathematical errors in the Statement, whether the calculation of
the Closing Working Capital was done in accordance with the Working Capital
Principles and whether Retained Cash or Closing Indebtedness were determined
in accordance with their respective definitions, and the Accounting Firm is
not to make any other determination, including any determination as to whether
U.S. GAAP was followed in calculating the 2007 Balance Sheet Working Capital
Amount, the Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash, Closing Indebtedness or
the Statement or as to whether the 2007 Balance Sheet Working Capital Amount
is correct. Any determinations by the Accounting Firm, and any  



 

15  work or analyses performed by the Accounting Firm in connection with its
resolution of any dispute under this Section 2.02 shall not be admissible
in evidence in any suit, action or other proceeding between the parties,
other than to the extent necessary to enforce payment obligations under
Section 2.02(c). Any items on or omissions from the 2007 Balance Sheet Working
Capital Amount that are based upon errors of fact or mathematical errors
shall be carried forward for purposes of calculating Closing Working Capital.

(f) Until the date on which the Statement shall become final and binding on
the parties pursuant to Section 2.02(b), Purchaser agrees that following the
Closing it shall preserve the accounting books and records of the Business on
which the Statement is to be based and shall not take any actions with
respect to such books and records that would obstruct, prevent or otherwise
affect the procedures or the results of the procedures set forth in this
Section 2.02 (including the amount of Closing Working Capital, Retained Cash
or Closing Indebtedness or any amount included in the 2007 Balance Sheet
Working Capital Amount or the Statement or the preparation of the Statement).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing no changes shall be made
during such period in any reserve or other account existing as of the date of
the Financial Statements, except as a result of events occurring after the
date of the Financial Statements and, in such event, only in a manner
consistent with the past practice of the Business.

(g) Until the date on which the Statement shall become final and binding on
the parties pursuant to Section 2.02(b), Purchaser agrees that following the
Closing it shall afford and cause to be afforded to Seller and any
accountants, counsel or financial advisors retained by Seller in connection
with the preparation of the Statement and any adjustment to the Purchase
Price contemplated by this Section 2.02, access upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours to the properties, books, contracts, personnel and
records of the Business and Purchasers and its accountants work papers (
_provided_ that Seller and its advisors, including its independent auditors,
have executed all release letters reasonably requested by Purchasers
independent auditors in connection therewith) relevant to the preparation of
the Statement and the adjustment contemplated by this Section 2.02, including
any Notice of Disagreement, and shall provide Seller, upon Sellers reasonable
request and at Sellers expense, with copies of any such books, contracts,
records and work papers; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall not
unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Purchaser, its Affiliates, the
Transferred Entities or the Business.

representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which
case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date), in each case except for breaches as to matters that,

reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur, as required by Section
8.04.

ARTICLE IV

_Representations and Warranties of Seller_

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule attached hereto (the "
_Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ") ( _provided_ that the disclosure of an item in
one section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a
disclosure in each section of the Seller Disclosure  



 

18  Schedule and to apply to any other representation and warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement to the extent the relevance and applicability of
such disclosure to such other section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is
reasonably apparent), Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as

Enforceability._ (a) Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing

transactions contemplated thereby will be, prior to Closing, duly and properly
taken.

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and, prior
to Closing, Seller and the Selling Affiliates will have duly executed and
delivered each Other Transaction Document to which it is, or is specified to
be, a party. Assuming that this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes, and, upon the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Other Transaction Documents
by Purchaser, each Other Transaction Document will constitute, a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Seller or the Selling Affiliates, as the case may
be, enforceable against such person in accordance with its terms.

SECTION 4.02. _No Conflicts; Consents._ (a) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Seller do not, and the execution and delivery of the Other
Transaction Documents by Seller and the Selling Affiliates specified to be
parties thereto will not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance by Seller and the Selling
Affiliates with the terms and conditions hereof and thereof will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of, breach or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancelation, payment or acceleration of any obligation or to
loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any liens, claims,
encumbrances, security interests, options, charges, right of first refusal,
easements, mortgages, deeds of trust, rights of way, restrictions on the
use of real property, encroachments, licenses to third parties or other
restrictions of any kind (" _Liens_ ") (other than Permitted Liens or Liens
arising from acts of Purchaser or its Affiliates) upon any of the Acquired
Assets or any properties or assets of any of the Transferred Entities under,
any provision of (i) the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws (or the
comparable governing instruments) of Seller, any Selling Affiliate or any of
the Transferred Entities, (ii) any Transferred Contract, Transferred Real
Property Contract,  



 

19  Transferred Entity Contract or any Contract set forth on Section 4.11 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or (iii) any Injunction, or, subject to
the matters referred to in paragraph (b) below, applicable Law, other than,
in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Seller
Material Adverse Effect (without giving effect to clause (vii) of the
definition thereof).

(b) No consent, waiver, approval, license, Permit, order or authorization of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Seller, any Selling
Affiliate or any Transferred Entity in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Other Transaction
Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, other than (i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act and
compliance with and filings and approvals under applicable foreign merger
control or competition Laws, (ii) compliance with and such filings and
notifications as may be required under applicable state property transfer Laws
or Environmental Laws, including the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act,

in the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Other Transaction
Documents, (iv) compliance with and filings under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (v)

of the New York Stock Exchange and (vi) such consents, waivers, approvals,
licenses, permits, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings the absence of which, or the failure to make or obtain
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
have a Seller Material Adverse Effect (without giving effect to clause (vii)
of the definition thereof).

SECTION 4.03. _Transferred Equity Interests._ Seller or a Selling Affiliate
has good and valid title to the applicable Purchased Companies Equity
Interests set forth opposite Sellers or such Selling Affiliates name in
Section B of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, in each case free and clear of
any Liens, and is the record and beneficial owner thereof. Each
Purchased Company has good and valid title to the Purchased Company
Subsidiaries Equity Interests set forth opposite such Purchased Companys
name in Section B of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, free and clear of all
Liens, and is the record and beneficial owner thereof. Assuming Purchaser has
the requisite power and authority to be the lawful owner of the Purchased
Companies Equity Interests, upon delivery to Purchaser at the Closing of
certificates representing the Purchased Companies Equity Interests, duly
endorsed by Seller or the applicable Selling Affiliate for transfer to
Purchaser, and upon Sellers receipt of the Closing Date Amount, good and
valid title to the Purchased Companies Equity Interests will pass to
Purchaser, free and clear of any Liens, other than those arising from acts of
Purchaser or its Affiliates.

SECTION 4.04. _Organization, Standing and Documents of Transferred Entities._
Section 4.04 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name and the
jurisdiction of organization of each Transferred Entity. Each Transferred
Entity is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, where
applicable, in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. Each Transferred Entity has all requisite corporate power and
authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise
hold its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations
and  



 

20  approvals the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Each
Transferred Entity is in good standing and duly qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or holding of its properties makes such qualification
necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to be in good standing
or so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably
likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Seller has, prior to the date
hereof, delivered or otherwise made available to Purchaser true and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
organizational documents), each as amended to the date hereof, of each
Transferred Entity. As of the Closing, none of the Fundamental Transferred
Entities is in violation of the provisions of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents). Any copies of
minutes of meetings or written consents of stockholders (or other
equityholders), board of directors (or similar body) and any committee
thereof of each Fundamental Transferred Entity that has been provided by or on
behalf of Seller to Purchaser accurately reflect in all material respects the
substance of the applicable meetings or consents.

SECTION 4.05. _Equity Interests in the Transferred Entities._ (a) As of the
date of this Agreement, there are not any outstanding bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness of any Transferred Entity having the right to vote
(or that are convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, securities
having the right to vote) on any matters on which holders of the
Transferred Equity Interests may vote (" _Transferred Entity Voting Debt_ ").
As of the date of this Agreement, there are not any outstanding (i) warrants,
options, convertible or exchangeable securities or other commitments or
undertakings (other than this Agreement) (x) pursuant to which Seller, any
Selling Affiliate or any Transferred Entity is or may become obligated to
issue, deliver or sell any additional units of its equity interests or any
security convertible into, or exchangeable for, any equity interest in any
Transferred Entity or any Transferred Entity Voting Debt, or (y) pursuant to
which Seller, any Selling Affiliate or any Transferred Entity is or may become
obligated to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such warrant, option,
right, unit, security, arrangement, commitment or undertaking.

(b) Section 4.05(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement and for each Transferred Entity, the number of
authorized equity interests in such Transferred Entity, the number of
outstanding equity interests in such Transferred Entity and the record and
beneficial owners thereof. Except for the Transferred Equity Interests, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are no shares of capital stock or other
equity securities of the applicable Transferred Entity issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. The Transferred Equity Interests have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. The
Transferred Equity Interests have not been issued in violation of, and are not
subject to, any preemptive, subscription or similar rights under any
provision of applicable Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws (or
comparable governing instruments) of the applicable Transferred Entity, or any
Contract to which the applicable Transferred Entity is subject, bound or a
party or otherwise. As of the date of this Agreement, there are not any
outstanding "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock based
performance units or arrangements or commitments that give any person the
right to receive any benefits or rights similar to any rights enjoyed by or
accruing to the holders of the Transferred Equity Interests.



 

21 (c) Except for equity interests in another Transferred Entity, as of the date
of this Agreement, no Transferred Entity owns, directly or indirectly, any
equity interests in any other person.

(d) Other than this Agreement, the Transferred Equity Interests are not
subject to any voting trust agreement or other Contract, including any such
Contract restricting or otherwise relating to the voting, dividend rights or
disposition of the Transferred Equity Interests.

Disclosure Schedule sets forth complete and correct copies of the following
financial statements of the Business: (i) the audited carve-out Balance Sheets

material respects the net assets of the Business as of the respective dates
thereof and the results of operations, changes in divisional equity and cash

forth in Section 4.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) and are not (with
or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or
default in any material respect thereunder except to the extent that such
failure to perform, breach or default, individually or in the aggregate, would
not be reasonably likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of Seller, no other party to any Contract set forth in Section
4.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (or required to be set forth in
Section 4.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) is (with or without the
lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default in

of each Transferred Permit, and each Transferred Entity validly holds and has
complied with all the terms and conditions of each Transferred Entity Permit,
except, in each case, for any such invalidity or non-compliance that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. Seller has delivered or made available to
Purchaser for inspection a true and correct copy of each Transferred Permit
and each Transferred Entity Permit. Each material Transferred Permit and each
Transferred Entity Permit are in full force and effect. Any applications for
the renewal of any such Transferred Permit or Transferred Entity Permit which

the appropriate Selling Affiliate or Transferred Entity prior to the Closing

Transferred Entity has received written notice of any suit, action or
proceeding relating to the revocation, withdrawal, termination, modification
or limitation of any Transferred Permit or Transferred Entity Permit the loss
of which, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have
a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Section 4.12(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, a true and complete list of all Permits that are

other person in any way affecting or arising out of the operation of the
Business or against a Transferred Entity or any of its properties, assets or
rights or any Acquired Assets and which (a) involve a claim of, or which
involve an unspecified amount which would reasonably be expected to result in
a Liability of, more than $1,000,000, (b) seek any material injunctive relief
 



 

30  affecting the Business or (c) seek to prohibit the Acquisition. To the
knowledge of Seller, as of the date of this Agreement, none of Seller,
any Affiliate of Seller or any Transferred Entity is a party or subject to or
in default under any material Injunction of any Governmental Entity or
arbitration tribunal applicable to the operation of the Business, a
Transferred Entity or any Acquired Asset. This Section 4.13 does not relate

to the extent no such copy exists, a description of the material terms),
summary plan descriptions and summaries of material modification for the U.S.
Benefit Plans (if applicable) and the most recent Internal Revenue Service or
Puerto Rico Department of Treasury (as applicable) determination letter or
opinion letter related to the U.S. Benefit Plans (if applicable). Except as
set forth in Section 4.14(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no U.S.
Benefit Plan is sponsored or maintained by a Transferred Entity.

(b) Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate of Seller has incurred any
unsatisfied liability (other than Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("
_PBGC_ ") premiums) to the PBGC or the Internal Revenue Service under Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA that could
result in the imposition of any liability on Purchaser or any of its ERISA
Affiliates.

(c) Each U.S. Benefit Plan with respect to which Purchaser or any Affiliate of
Purchaser could have any material Liability hereunder, including,
without limitation, under Article IX, that covers any Business Employee has
been and is being administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws. All the U.S. Benefit
Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
and/or Section 1165 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 1994, as
amended (the " _PR Code_ "), have received determination letters from the IRS
and/or the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury to the effect that such U.S.
Benefit Plans are qualified and the plans and trusts related thereto are
exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code and/or Sections 1101 and 1165 of the PR Code,
respectively, and no condition exists and no event has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of such letters.



 

31 (d) Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate of Seller nor any person appointed
or otherwise designated to act on behalf of Seller or any ERISA Affiliate of
Seller has engaged in any transactions in connection with any U.S. Benefit
Plan that are reasonably expected to result in the imposition of material
penalties pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA, material damages pursuant to
Section 409 of ERISA or a material tax pursuant to Section 4975(a) of the Code
that could result in the imposition of any material Liability on Purchaser or
any of its ERISA Affiliates.

(e) Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate of Seller has incurred any
"withdrawal liability" within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA to any
multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.

Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to Article IX to any employee, officer or
director of the Transferred Entities or the Business under any existing
contract, agreement or U.S. Benefit Plan (including by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby) would be nondeductible under Section 280G
of the Code.

(g) Neither the execution of, nor consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional or subsequent event) constitute an event under any U.S. Benefit
Plan that will or may result in any payment or provision of, acceleration
of, vesting or increase in, any benefits (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), with respect to any current or former employee, independent
contractor, consultant, agent or director of the Seller or any Affiliate
thereof, or any beneficiary thereof, with respect to which the Purchaser or
its Affiliates may have any obligations or material Liability.

(h) No claim, litigation or administrative or other action, proceeding,
audit, examination or investigation is pending or asserted, or, to the
knowledge of Seller, threatened, anticipated or expected to be asserted with
respect to any U.S. Benefit Plan or the assets of any such plan (other than
routine claims for benefits arising in the ordinary course) that could result
in the imposition of any material Liability on Purchaser or its ERISA
Affiliates.

(i) Section 4.14(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
each Benefit Plan maintained, or contributed to, by Seller or its Affiliates
for the benefit of Business Employees primarily based outside of the United
States and Puerto Rico (the " _Foreign Benefit Plans_ "). Each Foreign Benefit
Plan with respect to which Purchaser or its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Entities) could have any material Liability has been operated
in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with applicable Laws
of the relevant jurisdiction in which such Foreign Benefit Plan is maintained.
Each Foreign Benefit Plan with respect to which the Purchaser or its
Affiliates may have any obligations or material liability that is intended to
qualify for favorable tax benefits under the Laws of any jurisdiction is so
qualified, and, to the knowledge of Seller, no condition exists and no event
has occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in the loss or
revocation of such status. All benefits, contributions and premiums relating
to each Foreign Benefit Plan with respect to which the Purchaser or its
Affiliates may have any obligations or material liability have been timely
paid or made in material compliance with its terms and with applicable Laws
and any related Contract. Seller has made available to Purchaser true
and complete copies of the Foreign Benefit Plans. There  



 

32  are no pending promised or committed, whether legally binding or not,
undertakings to create or terminate any new Foreign Benefit Plan or to make
material improvements, increases or changes to any Foreign Benefit Plan, nor
is there any pattern of _ad hoc_ benefit increases under any Foreign Benefit
Plan that may be enforceable against Purchaser or its Affiliates. All Foreign
Benefit Plans with respect to which Purchaser or its Affiliates may have any
Liability which provide benefits after termination of employment of a
Transferred Employee, other than any pension plan, can be terminated upon
reasonable notice without material Liability to Purchaser or its Affiliates.
Neither the execution of, nor consummation of, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional
or subsequent event) constitute an event under any Foreign Benefit Plan that
will or may result in any payment or provision of, acceleration of, or vesting
or increase in, any benefits (whether of severance pay or otherwise), with
respect to any current or former employee, independent
contractor, consultant, agent or director of Seller or any Affiliate thereof,
or any beneficiary thereof, with respect to which the Purchaser or its
Affiliates may have any obligations or material Liability. No claim,
litigation or administrative or other action, proceeding, audit, examination
or investigation is pending or asserted, or, to the knowledge of Seller,
threatened, anticipated or expected to be asserted with respect to any Foreign
Benefit Plan or the assets of any such plan (other than routine claims for
benefits arising in the ordinary course) that could result in the imposition
of any material Liability on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

SECTION 4.15. _Absence of Changes or Events._ (a) Since December 31, 2007,
there have not been any facts, changes, developments, conditions, effects,
events or occurrences that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or
would reasonably be likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

(b) During the period since December 31, 2007 until the date of this
Agreement, Seller has caused the Business to be conducted in all material
respects in the ordinary course and none of Seller, any Selling Affiliate or
any Transferred Entity has taken any action that, if taken after the date of

and other than clause (vii) solely with respect to Business Employees with a
base salary less than $200,000) other than any actions that are permitted by

Transferred Entity has received any written communication from a Governmental
Entity that alleges that the Business or any Transferred Entity is in
violation of any applicable Laws, except for any such violations that,

Seller Material Adverse Effect. This Section 4.16 does not relate to matters
with respect to Taxes, which are the subject of Section 4.07, employee
benefit or ERISA matters, which are the subject of Section 4.14, or employee
or labor matters, which are the subject of Section 4.18.

such transaction, if applicable) entitled to vote on matters to be determined
by the shareholders of Seller (or such successor, if applicable).

(b) Section 5.06(a) shall be deemed not breached as a result of the ownership

in any Competing Business; _provided_ that neither Seller nor any Affiliates
of Seller shall have the right to appoint a member of the board of directors
of such Competing Business or (ii) an interest otherwise proscribed by this
Section 5.06 if such interest arises as a result of the acquisition following
the Closing Date of a person that engages, directly or indirectly, in a
Competing Business; _provided_ that (A) such acquisition is not undertaken
for the primary purpose of evading the obligations of Seller or any of its
controlled Affiliates under Section 5.06(a) and (B) either (1) at the time of

during the Non-Compete Period any interest in a person that engages, directly
or indirectly, in a Competing Business that constitutes more than fifteen
percent (15%) of such persons consolidated annual revenues and has annual
revenues in excess of $25 million, then Seller shall, or shall cause any such
acquiring controlled Affiliate to, divest such interest as promptly as

terminated by Purchaser or its Affiliates without cause, (B) solicit for
employment, hire or employ any Restricted Transferred Employees who are no
longer employed by the Business at the time of Sellers or its Affiliates
first contact with them and who have been terminated by Purchaser or its

Employee where required by applicable Law, a collective bargaining agreement

precedent to the availability of the Debt Financing. Subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions of the Financing, and subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions of this Agreement, the Financing would provide
Purchaser with acquisition financing at the Closing sufficient to consummate

Agreement, Purchaser has delivered to Seller a guarantee, dated the date
hereof, of each of the Equity Funds guaranteeing certain of Purchasers
obligations hereunder (the " _Sponsor Guarantees_ "). Each Sponsor Guarantee

obligation of the applicable Equity Fund, enforceable in accordance with its
terms.

warranties made by Purchaser in this Article VI are the exclusive
representations and warranties made by Purchaser to Seller. Purchaser hereby
disclaims any other express or implied representations or warranties by

terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents
shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement for a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date. 

SECTION 7.02. _No Additional Representations._ Purchaser acknowledges that it
and its Representatives have received or been afforded the opportunity to

and its Representatives have been permitted satisfactory access to the books
and records, facilities, equipment, Contracts, insurance policies (or

and the Acquired Assets that it and its Representatives have desired or
requested to see and/or review, and that it and its Representatives have had
satisfactory opportunity to meet with the officers and employees of Seller
and its Affiliates to discuss the Business, the Transferred Entities, the
Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees

Assets or the Assumed Liabilities furnished or made available to Purchaser
and its representatives and (b) other than in the case of fraud, none of
Seller, any Selling Affiliate or any other person shall have or be subject to
any liability to or claim to indemnification (whether pursuant to Section

distribution to Purchaser, or Purchasers use of, any such information,
including the Confidential  



 

47  Information Memorandum with respect to the Business dated December 2007, and
any information, documents or material made available to Purchaser and

manufacturers anywhere in the world) or in any other form in expectation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 7.03. _No Use of Certain Names; Transitional License._ (a) Purchaser
shall as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, revise sales and product literature,
packaging and labeling to (i) delete all references to the BMS Names and (ii)
delete all references to Sellers or any Selling Affiliates customer service
address or phone number; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for a period of
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date, Purchaser may continue to
distribute sales and product literature, Transferred Inventory and any
Inventory of the Transferred Entities that uses any of the BMS Names,
addresses or phone numbers to the extent that such sales and product
literature, Transferred Inventory and Inventory of the Transferred Entities
exists on the Closing Date or is manufactured within the ninety (90)-day
period after the Closing Date, and Seller hereby grants to Purchaser the
limited right and a royalty-free paid-up license to use Sellers trademarks,
trade dress, copyrights and other Intellectual Property owned by Seller (and
covenants to cause each of its Affiliates to grant Purchaser the limited right
and a royalty-free paid-up license to use such Affiliates trademarks, trade
dress and copyrights under any copyrights and other Intellectual Property
owned by such Affiliate) that have been used in connection with the
manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of the Products, to the extent
necessary to allow Purchaser to use such sales and product literature,
Transferred Inventory and Inventory of the Transferred Entities. In no event
shall Purchaser use any BMS Names, addresses or phone numbers after the
Closing Date in any manner or for any purpose different from the use of such
BMS Names, addresses or phone numbers by the Business during the ninety
(90)-day period preceding the Closing Date. " _BMS Names_ " means "Bristol-
Myers", "Bristol-Myers Squibb", "Bristol-Myers Squibb Company", "E.R. Squibb

of Seller or its Affiliates not included in the Transferred Intellectual
Property.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within ten (10)
business days following the Closing, to the extent necessary, Purchaser shall
cause each Transferred Entity to change its corporate name to a name not
including, or, in the reasonable judgment of Seller, not confusingly similar
to, any of the BMS Names. As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within ten (10) business days following the Closing, to the extent necessary,
Purchaser shall cause each Transferred Entity to amend or terminate any
certificate of assumed name or d/b/a filing by such Transferred Entity so as
to eliminate their right to use any of the BMS Names or any name that, in the
reasonable judgment of Seller. is confusingly similar to any of the BMS Names.

(c) Notwithstanding Sections 7.03(a) and 7.03(b), Purchaser shall be entitled
to use BMS Names to accurately reference entities and products
which historically bore such names in historical descriptions of the Business
and its operations; _provided_ that Seller shall have the right to review and
approve any such use prior to its use, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld. 



 

48 SECTION 7.04. _FDA Reporting; NDC._ (a) Purchaser shall take any and all
actions, as soon as practicable following the date hereof so that as soon as
practicable following the Closing (but in no event later than ninety (90)
business days following the Closing) Sellers National Drug Code number or
Labeler Code on the packaging for the Products shall be replaced with
Purchasers National Drug Code number or Labeler Code; _provided_ that
Purchasers obligation pursuant to this sentence shall not apply with respect
to any finished goods and packaging included in the Transferred Inventory or
any Inventories of the Transferred Entities as of the Closing Date or
manufactured within the ninety (90)-day period after the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, such action shall include Purchasers obtaining a new
National Drug Code number or Labeler Code, if it does not already have one.
From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all
obligations with respect to annual or adverse event reporting to the United
States Food and Drug Administration (the " _FDA_ ") with respect to the
Brands and Purchaser shall promptly submit any and all such reports as may be
required by the FDA.

(b) Purchaser shall communicate to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (" _CMS_ "), with a copy to Seller, the expiration dates for the
last manufactured lots (" _Last Lot Expiration Dates_ ") of each of the
Products manufactured by or on behalf of Purchaser that bears Sellers
National Drug Code number or Labeler Code as soon as each such Last
Lot Expiration Date is available. Seller shall maintain with the FDA Sellers
National Drug Code number or Labeler Code for each Product as required for the
manufacture and distribution of the Products until the latest expiry of lots
of Products included in the Transferred Inventory.

SECTION 7.05. _Litigation Matters._ Following the Closing, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including, in the case of Purchaser, the
Transferred Entities) to, cooperate fully with Seller and its Affiliates in
the prosecution, defense and/or settlement and all other aspects of the
administration of the litigation listed in Section 1.03(b)(iii) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or such other lawsuit, action, other proceeding, claim or
investigation against Seller or any of its Affiliates as Seller in its sole
discretion determines is necessary, to the extent such cooperation does not
unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Purchaser and its Affiliates.
Such cooperation shall include (i) affording Seller, its Affiliates, its
counsel and its other representatives full and complete access,
upon reasonable written notice during normal business hours, to all relevant
personnel, properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, (ii)
furnishing promptly to Seller, its Affiliates, its counsel and its other
representatives any information reasonably requested by it, such Affiliates,
such counsel or such other representatives and (iii) providing any other
assistance to Seller, its Affiliates, its counsel and its other
representatives reasonably requested by Seller, such Affiliates, such counsel
or such other representatives, in each case to the extent such cooperation
would not be reasonably expected to result in the forfeiture of any attorney-
client privilege of Purchaser or its Affiliates or violate any Contract or
applicable Law; _provided_ that Seller shall, and shall cause the Selling
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to make reasonable and
appropriate substitute cooperation arrangements under circumstances in which
such cooperation restrictions apply. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting Seller
pursuant to this Section 7.05.



 

49 SECTION 7.06. _Bulk Transfer Laws._ Purchaser hereby waives compliance by

shall be responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for all applicable
recordations of the assignment of the Transferred Intellectual Property from
the title owner of such Intellectual Property to Purchaser or a Purchaser

SECTION 7.08. _Debt Financing_. (a) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws, and to execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such instruments and documents as may be required, to
arrange the Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and
subject only to the conditions contained in the Financing Letters and, if
applicable, the Interim Facility Letter (or any replacement commitments
obtained by Purchaser in compliance with this Section 7.08), including, in the
case of the Debt Financing, to (i) satisfy, and cause its Affiliates to
satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser or its
Affiliates contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or, if applicable, the
Interim Facility Letter (or any replacement commitments obtained by Purchaser
in compliance with this Section 7.08) and (ii) consummate the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or, if applicable, the Interim
Facility Letter (or any replacement commitments obtained by Purchaser in
compliance with this Section 7.08) at the Closing, including using its
reasonable best efforts to cause the financial institutions providing the Debt
Financing to fund the Debt Financing (including by taking enforcement action
to cause such financial institutions to fund the Debt Financing). Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from taking, directly or
indirectly, any action that is reasonably likely to result in the failure of
any of the conditions contained in the Financing Letters and the
Interim Facility Letter (or any replacement commitments obtained by Purchaser
in compliance with this Section 7.08) or in any definitive agreement related
to the Financing. Purchaser shall draw, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Financing Lenders to fund at Closing, the Interim
Facility Letter in the event that the definitive facilities contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter have not been executed by the Purchaser and the
Financing lenders on or prior to the date that is three (3) business days
prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall cause the Equity Funds to fund the
Equity Financing at Closing.

(b) Purchaser shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any Financing Letter or the
Interim Facility Letter (or any replacement commitments obtained by Purchaser
in compliance with this Section 7.08) or the definitive agreements relating
to the Financing without Sellers prior written consent, except that Purchaser
may amend, supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Interim Facility Letter (or any replacement commitments obtained by Purchaser
in compliance with this Section 7.08) if such amendment, supplement or other
modification (i) does not reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financings,
(ii) does not contain additional or modified conditions or other
contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing relative to those contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Interim Facility Letter, as the case may
be (or any replacement commitments obtained by Purchaser in compliance with
this Section 7.08) and (iii) is otherwise not reasonably likely to impair or
delay  



 

50  the funding of the Debt Financing or the Closing (it being understood that,
subject to the requirements of this clause (b), such amendment, supplement
or other modification of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Interim Facility
Letter, as the case may be (or any replacement commitments obtained by
Purchaser in compliance with this Section 7.08), may provide for the
assignment of a portion of the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Interim Facility Letter, as the case may be (or any replacement
commitments obtained by Purchaser in compliance with this Section 7.08), to
additional agents or arrangers and grant such persons approval rights with
respect to certain matters as are customarily granted to additional agents or
arrangers).

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Letters or the Interim Facility Letter
(or any replacement commitments obtained by Purchaser in compliance with this
Section 7.08), Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller, and Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, replacement commitments on terms that
will enable Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that are not less favorable in the aggregate (as determined by
Purchaser in its reasonable judgment) to Purchaser and Seller than those
contained in the Financing Letters and/or the Interim Facility Letter, as
the case may be (or any replacement commitments obtained by Purchaser in
compliance with this Section 7.08); _provided_ that such replacement
commitments shall not (i) be subject to any additional or modified conditions
or other contingencies to the funding of the Financing than those contained
in the Financing Letters and/or the Interim Facility Letter, as the case may
be (or any replacement commitments obtained by Purchaser in compliance with
this Section 7.08) or (ii) otherwise be reasonably likely to impair or delay
the funding of the Financing or the Closing. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller
complete and correct copies of all amendments, supplements, other
modifications or agreements pursuant to which any amended, supplemented,
modified or replacement commitments shall provide Purchaser with any portion
of the Financing; _provided_ that Purchaser may redact from any such copies
the fee amounts payable to their Financing sources. 

(d) Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a timely basis of the status of
the Financing and any material developments relating to the Financing.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 7.08, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein are not conditioned upon the
availability or consummation of the Debt Financing or receipt of the proceeds
therefrom.

SECTION 7.09. _Benefits and Payroll Transition_. Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to put in place the necessary personnel and systems
to enable Purchaser to administer its own benefit plans and payroll systems on
the Closing Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, with a view
to reducing both the extent and the duration of the transitional services
with respect to such matters to be provided to Purchaser pursuant to the
Transitional Services Agreement.



 

51 SECTION 7.10. _Joint Tender Contracts_. Purchaser acknowledges that, in
certain international jurisdictions, Seller is a party to certain joint
tender contracts with third parties relating to the Business. Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Business to (a) comply with its
obligations to supply Products to Seller in connection with each such joint
tender contract and (b) otherwise cooperate with Seller in the administration
of, compliance with the terms of, and performance under, each such joint
tender contract, in each case, until the scheduled expiration of the term of
such contract (or, if earlier, the termination of such contract). Each of
Seller and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, upon the expiration of the
term of each such joint tender contract (or, if earlier, the termination of
such contract), the parties will not have any obligation to renew such joint
tender contract.

ARTICLE VIII

_Mutual Covenants_

SECTION 8.01.  _Consents._ Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents and
waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
required from parties to the Transferred Real Property Contracts, the

Transferred Permits, the Transferred Entity Permits and the Transferred
Environmental Permits in order to transfer such Transferred Real Property
Contracts, Transferred Contracts, Transferred Entity Contracts, Transferred
Permits, Transferred Entity Permits or Transferred Environmental Permits to
Purchaser and that such consents and waivers have not been obtained. Purchaser
agrees that, except as provided in Section 1.05(b), Seller and its Affiliates
shall not have any liability or obligation whatsoever to Purchaser arising out
of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or waivers that may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or because of the termination of any Transferred Real Property Contract,
Transferred Contract, Transferred Entity Contract, Transferred Permit,
Transferred Entity Permit or Transferred Environmental Permit as a result
thereof. Purchaser further agrees that no representation, warranty or
covenant of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and
no condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (a) the failure to
obtain any such consent or waiver, (b) any such termination or (c) any
lawsuit, action, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on
behalf of any person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
such consent or waiver or any such termination except to the extent Sellers
representations in Section 4.02 are untrue. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause the Selling Affiliates and the Transferred Entities to,
(i) make the initial request for such consent or waiver from the applicable
third party and (ii) otherwise cooperate with Purchaser upon its reasonable
request in any reasonable manner in connection with Purchaser obtaining any
such consents and waivers; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case such
cooperation shall not include any requirement of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Selling Affiliates and the Transferred Entities) to
expend money, commence, defend or participate in any litigation, incur any
obligation in favor of, or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to, any third party.

SECTION 8.02. _Transition; Cooperation._  (a) Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate with each other, and shall cause their respective Representatives to
cooperate with each other, for a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing
to ensure the orderly transition of the Business from Seller to Purchaser and
to minimize any disruption to the respective  



 

52  businesses of Seller, the Selling Affiliates, the Transferred Entities and
Purchaser that might result from the transactions contemplated hereby. After
the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Purchaser and Seller shall
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their respective
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to such
information and assistance relating to the Business, the Transferred
Entities, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as is reasonably
necessary for financial reporting and accounting matters, the preparation and
filing of any Tax Returns, reports or forms or the defense of any Tax claim,
assessment or inquiry. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
avail itself of any available exemptions from any Transfer Taxes or fees
applicable to the Acquisition, and to cooperate with the other party in
providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain
such exemptions. The obligation to cooperate pursuant to the preceding
sentence insofar as it concerns Taxes shall terminate at the time the relevant
applicable statute of limitations expires (giving effect to any extension
thereof). Each party shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to this Section
8.02. Neither party shall be required by this Section 8.02 to take any action
that would (i) unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or
unreasonably disrupt its normal operations, (ii) result in its forfeiture of
any attorney-client privilege or (iii) violate any Contract or applicable
Law; _provided_ that Seller shall, and shall cause the Selling Affiliates and
the Transferred Entities to, use commercially reasonable efforts to make
reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions on access set forth in clauses (ii) or
(iii) apply.

(b) From time to time, as and when requested by either party hereto, the
other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,
all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all
such further or other actions (subject to the provisions of Sections 8.01 and
8.04), as such other party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Without limiting Sections 1.05(b) or 8.01(a), Purchaser, Seller and the
Selling Affiliates shall cooperate using their commercially reasonable efforts
to transfer, obtain, or to cause to be transferred or obtained, prior to the
Closing or as soon as practicable thereafter, any Permit or Environmental
Permit necessary for Purchaser to own or operate the Business, the Transferred
Entities or the Acquired Assets. During the period commencing on the
date hereof and continuing until one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing, (i) each of Seller, the Selling Affiliates and Purchaser shall
provide or cause to be provided to the other parties all commercially
reasonable assistance as is reasonably requested in connection with securing
(and/or terminating, if required by applicable Law or Environmental Law) any
such Permits or Environmental Permits and (ii) if any Permits or Environmental
Permits are not secured prior to the Closing, Seller, the Selling Affiliates
and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith in any lawful and reasonable
arrangement reasonably proposed by either party under which Purchaser shall
obtain the benefit of Permits or Environmental Permits held by Seller or the
Selling Affiliates in connection with the ownership or operation of the
Business, the Transferred Entities or the Acquired Assets following the
Closing; _provided_ that such assistance and cooperation shall not include
any obligation to expend money to any third party or Governmental Entity from
whom such Permits or Environmental Permits are requested under this Section
8.02(c), or to commence, defend or participate in any litigation or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.



 

53 SECTION 8.03. _Publicity._ Seller and Purchaser agree that, from and after the
date hereof, no public release or announcement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by either party or its
Affiliates without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in
the form agreed by the parties.

SECTION 8.04. _Reasonable Best Efforts._ Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement (including the provisions set forth in Sections
1.05(b) and 8.05), each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Closing to occur. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller and
Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur on or prior to July 1, 2008, or as soon as practicable
thereafter. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any
of their respective Affiliates to, take any action that would, or that would
reasonably be expected to, result in any of the conditions set forth in
Article III not being satisfied.

SECTION 8.05. _Antitrust Notification and Other Regulatory Filings._ (a)
Purchaser and Seller shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, file with
all applicable U.S. and foreign Governmental Entities any notices and
applications necessary to obtain merger control or competition Law approval
for the Acquisition; _provided_ that Seller shall have the right to review and
provide comments on any such notices and applications prior to their filing,
consistent with applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser and
Seller shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later
than fifteen (15) business days after the date of this Agreement, file with
the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United
States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form,
if any, required under the HSR Act for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Any such notices and applications, including such HSR Act
notification and report form, shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable foreign merger control or
competition Law. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary
under the HSR Act or any such foreign merger control or competition Law. Each
of Seller and Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other Governmental Entity and shall comply with
any such inquiry or request as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than five (5) business days after receipt of such inquiry or request. Any such
additional information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable foreign merger control or
competition Law. Purchaser agrees not to extend directly any waiting period
under the HSR Act or any foreign merger control or competition Law or enter
into any agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written
consent of Seller. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall use its best efforts to
obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act and any such foreign merger
control or competition Law for the consummation of the Acquisition.



 

54 (b) Without limiting the generality of Purchasers obligations pursuant to
Section 8.05(a), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any competition or antitrust
Law, or if any Law or Injunction is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced
by a Governmental Entity that would make the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement illegal or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Purchaser shall use its best efforts to resolve, contest or resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Injunction, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to have such Law or Injunction repealed,
rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) selling, holding
separate or otherwise disposing of, or proposing and agreeing to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of, or permitting the sale, holding separate or
other disposition of, any assets of Purchaser or its subsidiaries, or after
the Closing, the Business and (ii) conducting its business in a specified
manner, or proposing and agreeing or permitting to conduct its business in a
specified manner. Solely with respect to the Business, the Acquired Assets
and the Transferred Entities, Seller will cooperate with Purchaser in all
respects in Purchasers implementation of any of the measures described in the
preceding sentence that is undertaken in order to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) If any approval or clearance required under an applicable merger control
or competition law in China is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing
shall nonetheless take place and, thereafter, Seller and the Selling
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall cooperate
in any lawful and reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Purchaser
(not including the payment of any consideration) under which Purchaser shall
obtain the economic claims, rights and benefits under, and shall bear all the
costs, liabilities and burdens with respect to, the Business conducted in
China (which shall not be transferred to Purchaser at Closing and shall be
held separate by Seller until such approval is obtained at which time it shall
be transferred to Purchaser); _provided_ that Purchaser shall pay or satisfy
all the costs, expenses, obligations and liabilities incurred by Seller or the
Selling Affiliates in connection with any such alternative arrangements (other
than legal fees incurred by Seller and the Selling Affiliates in connection
with documenting and negotiating such arrangement, which shall be borne by
Seller).

SECTION 8.06. _Support Services._ Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Entities) provide certain support services (" _Support Services_
") to the Business and employees of the Business in connection with the
operation of the Business as conducted as of the date of this Agreement.
Purchaser acknowledges that, except to the extent provided in the Transitional
Services Agreement, all Support Services will be terminated as of the Closing
Date. Seller and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take the actions necessary to enable Seller and its Affiliates to perform in
all material respects as of and following Closing all services to be provided
under the Transitional Services Agreement.

SECTION 8.07. _Tax Matters._ (a) Seller and Purchaser agree in principle on an
allocation of the Final Purchase Price among (i) the Transferred Entities,
(ii) the portion of the Acquired Assets that relates to property, plant and
equipment and (iii) the portion of the Acquired Assets that relates to
inventory, working capital and accounts receivable on a  



 

55  jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis of 40% to the U.S., 45% to the U.K. and
15% to all other countries (the " _Initial Purchase Price Allocation_ "). For
purposes of this provision, the U.S. includes the Dominican Republic. Each of
Seller and Purchaser shall (i) further allocate the Initial Purchase Price
Allocation among the Transferred Entities and Acquired Assets in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and relevant provisions of local Law and (ii)
use its best efforts and work together in good faith to agree on such further
allocation prior to the Closing and to agree on any allocation of post-
Closing adjustments in a timely manner; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Seller and Purchaser agree that the amount to be allocated to the Purchasers
purchase of the stock of ConvaTec Dominican Republic, Inc. shall
be approximately $10,400,000. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall (i) report
the sale and purchase of the Transferred Entities and Acquired Assets for
United States and other Tax purposes in accordance with such allocations
determined in accordance with this Section 8.07(a), including as required on
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and (ii) not take any position inconsistent
with such allocations on any of its respective United States and other Tax
Returns except as otherwise required by Law.

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall be entitled to any refunds or credits relating
to Taxes arising out of, relating to or in respect of the Acquired Assets as
determined in Article I. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds or
credits of Taxes of the Transferred Entities, or of any affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which a Transferred Entity is or
has been a member, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
Seller. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds or credits of Taxes of
the Transferred Entities for any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the
account of Purchaser unless such item relates to a carryforward in a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, in which case such item is for the account of Seller.

(i) Each party shall forward, or cause to be forwarded, to the party entitled
pursuant to this Section 8.07(b) to receive the amount or economic benefit of
a refund or credit of Taxes the amount of such refund or credit within ten
(10) days after such refund is received or after such credit is allowed or
applied against another Tax liability, as the case may be.

(ii) Purchaser shall waive any carrybacks to any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the
extent permitted by Law.

(iii) If, subsequent to a taxing authoritys allowance of a refund or credit,
such taxing authority reduces or eliminates such allowance, any refund or
credit, plus any interest received thereon, forwarded or reimbursed under this
Section 8.07 shall be returned to the party who had forwarded or reimbursed
such refund or credit and interest, upon the request of such forwarding
party, in an amount equal to the applicable reduction, including any interest
received thereon.

(c) To the extent permitted by Law or administrative practice, the taxable
years of the Transferred Entities shall end at the close of business on the
Closing Date.



 

56 (d) Purchaser and Seller agree that:

(i) Seller shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
on a basis consistent with past practice, (A)(I) the United States
consolidated federal income Tax Returns that include the Transferred Entities
and (II) where applicable, all other Tax Returns of the Transferred Entities
filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with Seller or any of its
Affiliates, in each case for taxable periods beginning on or before the
Closing Date, and (B) all other Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred
Entities that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date. Seller
shall timely pay, or cause to be paid, any Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns. Seller shall provide the Purchaser with copies of such completed Tax
Returns (or, in the case of Tax Returns referred to in clause (A) of this
Section 8.07(d)(i), the portion of such Tax Returns relating to the
Transferred Entities) at least twenty (20) days before such Tax Returns are
due and consider in good faith any comments provided by the Purchaser.
Purchaser shall pay Seller for the amount of Taxes shown on such Tax Return
to the extent the Taxes shown on the Tax Return are an obligation of the
Purchaser under Section 10.03(b) at least three (3) days before the last day
of the Tax shown on the Tax Return is due and payable. 

(ii) Purchaser shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, on a basis consistent with past practice (to the extent consistent
with applicable Law), all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred Entities
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and that relate to a
taxable period or portion thereof beginning on or before the Closing Date
(other than any Tax Return described in Section 8.07(d)(i)(A)). With respect
to Tax Returns for a Straddle Period, Purchaser shall provide Seller with a
draft of any such Tax Returns at least twenty (20) days before such Tax Return
is due for approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) and the Purchaser will consider in good faith any comments provided
by the Seller (and reasonably accept any such comments to the extent relating
to Taxes that are an obligation of the Seller under Section 10.03(a)). The
Purchaser shall timely pay, or cause to be paid, any Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns. Seller shall pay the Purchaser for the amount of Taxes shown
on such Tax Return to the extent the Taxes shown on the Tax Return are an
obligation of the Seller under Section 10.03(a) at least three (3) days before
the last day that the Tax shown on the Tax Return is due and payable.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Tax Returns that
must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed
when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible under the
applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party
at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns.

(e) For all Tax purposes, Purchaser, Seller and each of their respective
Affiliates agree to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price received by Seller for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless a final determination (as defined
in Section 1313 of the Code) provides otherwise.



 

57 (f) Upon Purchasers request, Seller and Purchaser (or its relevant Affiliate)
shall timely make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and
similar provision of state or local law) with respect to ConvaTec Dominican
Republic, Inc.

(g) All tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving Seller or the Selling Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Transferred Entities, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Transferred Entities shall
not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(h) All amounts expressed in this Agreement as being payable by Purchaser
with respect to the Business and/or Acquired Assets are expressed to be
exclusive of any value added Tax (or similar Taxes) which may be chargeable
and Purchaser will pay to Seller in addition to such amounts, an amount equal
to any value added Tax (or similar Tax) for which Seller is liable to account
to the applicable Taxing authority in respect of any supply made to Purchaser
under or in connection with this Agreement upon production to Purchaser of a
valid value added Tax (or other similar Tax) invoice in respect of the sale of
the Business and/or Acquired Assets.

SECTION 8.08. _Customer Databases._ (a) At least twenty (20) business days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause a Selling Affiliate
to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to contact by letter or email (i)
each customer of Products in the United States that has not previously
consented to have its personal information transferred to a third party in
connection with a sale, disposition or other transfer of the Business (each
such non-consenting customer to be specifically identified on the master
list, maintained by Seller and its Affiliates, of customers of the Business
within the United States (the " _U.S. Customer List_ ")) and (ii) each
customer of Products in jurisdictions other than the United States and Japan,
the laws of which require the consent of a customer for the transfer of such
customers personal information to a third party (each such customer to be
specifically identified on the master list, maintained by Seller and its
Affiliates, of customers of the Business outside the United States and Japan
(the " _Non-U.S. Customer List_ ")), in each case, to allow each such person
ten (10) business days to decline (or, in the case of customers on the
Non-U.S. Customer List, to the extent required by Law, to permit or decline)
to have such persons identity and other personal information provided to
Purchaser (and, in the case of customers on the Non-U.S. Customer List, to be
transferred to a country designated by Purchaser), which election shall be
made by a reply letter, email or registration on a website designated by
Seller (or the applicable Selling Affiliate). Any person that
Seller reasonably determines it was unable to contact ( _e.g._ , if Seller
does not have a postal or an email address for such person or if Seller or the
applicable Selling Affiliate received an "undeliverable" response to a letter
or an email addressed to such person) or any person who did not reply to the
communication sent by Seller will be deemed to have declined to have such
persons identity and personal information provided to Purchaser.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of Section 1.02 to the contrary, upon the
Closing, Sellers sole obligation with respect to each of the U.S. Customer
List and the Non-U.S. Customer List shall be to deliver to Purchaser a single
electronic copy of such list; _provided_ that Seller shall, to the extent
necessary to comply with applicable Law, delete the identity and other
personal information of each person that declined (or was deemed to decline)
to have such information provided to Purchaser from the copy of the applicable
list to be delivered to Purchaser prior to delivery thereof. Subsequent to
such delivery, Seller shall delete and/or destroy any other copies of such
lists and provide written verification thereof.



 

58 (c) At all times following the Closing, Purchaser shall have in place and
strictly observe a privacy policy with respect to the copy of U.S. Customer
List and the Non-U.S. Customer List that is at least as protective of the
interests of the persons identified on such customer lists in the privacy of
their respective identities and personal information as the privacy policy of
Seller as in effect on the date of this Agreement, a copy of which is included
in Section 8.08(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

(d) In the event a Selling Affiliate remains a "Data Controller," as that term
is defined by the EU Data Protection Directive, in an EU member state after
the Closing, the provisions of Section 8.08(a) and (b) shall not apply and
such Selling Affiliate shall be permitted to retain its entire Non-U.S.
Customer List, without any deletion.

SECTION 8.09. _Treasury, Payroll and Employee Benefit Transitional Services_.
(a) From the date hereof through Closing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to acquire, lease, license, hire or otherwise put in place all
personnel, Contracts, assets and services necessary for Purchaser to perform
without assistance from Seller or any of its Affiliates, the Treasury
Services, the Payroll Services and the Benefit Services (each, a " _Service_
" and, collectively, the " _Services_ ") on the Closing Date or as soon
practicable thereafter with a view to reducing the scope of each such Service
to be provided by Seller following the Closing (including the jurisdictions
in which each such Service is to be provided and the duration of each such
Service), and Seller shall cooperate with such efforts by Purchaser;
_provided_ that none of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to
hire any personnel, independent contractors or consultants, to incur any out-
of-pocket costs or expenses, or to enter into any binding Contract or other
arrangement under which Seller or such Affiliate will incur any Liability
other than a Liability of a Transferred Entity arising after the Closing. To
the extent that Seller determines (in consultation with Purchaser) that it is
reasonably necessary to hire any personnel, independent contractors or
consultants, incur any out-of-pocket costs or expenses, or to enter into any
binding Contract or other arrangement (the " _Set-Up and Administrative Costs_
") in order to provide any Payroll Service or Benefit Service, all such Set-
Up and Administrative Costs (including the cost of legal, IT and other
services) and such costs incurred by Seller after such Services are no longer
required and which are necessary in order to return its payroll and benefits
administrative function to its pre-provision of Services status (the " _Post-
Services Costs_ ") shall be borne solely by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
fully indemnify Seller for such Set-Up and Administrative Costs and such Post-
Services Costs incurred prior to, on and after the Closing Date, whether or
not such Services are actually needed or utilized post-Closing. The payment of
such Set-Up and Administrative Costs and such post-services costs shall be in
addition to the $20,000,000 payment by Purchaser specified in Section 3(c) of
the Transitional Services Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no
termination, amendment or modification of any Benefit Plan, program or
arrangement shall be required to be made by Seller or any of its Affiliates
in order to provide any Benefit Service. Furthermore, nothing herein shall
prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from making changes to its Benefit
Plans, programs and arrangements following the Closing Date; _provided_  that
(i) such change does not apply exclusively to Business Employees but generally
to all participants in such Benefit Plan, regardless of whether such
participants are Business Employees and (ii) such change does not cause
Purchaser to Breach its covenant under Section 9.05(a).



 

59 (b) If Purchaser shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under Section 8.09(a), and Purchaser shall not have in place all
such personnel, Contracts, assets and services necessary for Purchaser to
provide all the Services to the Business at the effective time of Closing
without receiving any portion of or all of one or more of the Services from
Seller, then (i) with respect to each Service, Seller shall provide, or cause
one or more of its controlled Affiliates to provide, subject to applicable
Law, the portion of each such Service (as shall be mutually agreed by Seller
and Purchaser) that Purchaser is not yet able to provide in each such
jurisdiction as may still be required on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Transitional Services Agreement for such Service for a period of up
to three (3) months at a cost payable monthly at a fixed amount equal to (i)
one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the Sellers or such Affiliates fully
allocated costs of providing such Service and (ii) where Purchaser requests
with sixty (60) days prior written notice to Seller or such Affiliate an
extension of the term of the relevant Service (up to a maximum of an
additional three (3) months), one hundred and fifty percent (150%)
of Sellers or such Affiliates fully allocated costs of providing such
services, plus a percent allocation of related overhead expenses, including
supplies, mailing, telecommunications, occupancy depreciation insurance and
system support. Any significant efforts related to non-routine activities
shall be billed at a rate per hour to be agreed by the parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller or such Affiliate may not bill Purchaser for such
efforts unless Purchaser has received notification thereof in advance and
consented in writing to the undertaking of such effort, such notification not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (it being understood that Seller or
such Affiliate shall not be obligated to utilize any such significant efforts
related to activities outside of what is routine unless Purchaser shall have
provided such consent).

(c) For purposes of this Section 8.09, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

" _Payroll Services_ " means the services currently provided to the Business
by Seller or one or more of its Affiliates related to the compensation and
reimbursement of Business Employees.

" _Benefits Services_ " means benefit administration support services
currently provided to the Business by Seller or one or more of its Affiliates
with respect to the Benefits Plans currently in place for Business Employees.

" _Treasury Services_ " means treasury services related to the management and
monitoring of cash transactions and bank accounts currently provided to
the Business by Seller or one or more of its Affiliates, which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include funding of any cash disbursements.

ARTICLE IX

_Employee Matters_

SECTION 9.01. _Employees; Assumption of Terms and Conditions of Employment;
Continuation of Employment; General Principles._ (a) For purposes of this
Article  



 

60  IX, Business Employees (as defined) shall also include such other employees
who may be hired by Seller or its Affiliates for the Business between the
date hereof and the Closing Date and whose services primarily relate to the
Business, in each case whether employed within or outside the United States,
whether active or on vacation, holiday, jury duty, bereavement or other leave
of absence or on short-term disability or long-term disability, but
excluding, in each case, employees whose services primarily relate to the
Excluded Assets.

(b) With respect to those Business Employees (other than Business Employees of
any Transferred Entity or except as required by applicable Law) who are not
actively at work on the Closing Date because they are on approved long-
term disability or short-term disability leave in accordance with the
applicable Benefit Plan (" _Inactive Business Employees_ "), from and after
the Closing Date, Seller shall continue to provide such Inactive Business
Employees with disability coverage under the applicable Benefit Plan to the
extent consistent with the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan; _provided_
that if any such Inactive Business Employee returns to active work at the
conclusion of such leave (and it being understood that Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall offer employment to each such Inactive Business Employee who
becomes ready, willing and able to return to active work within twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date or as otherwise required by applicable Law),
such Inactive Business Employee shall become a "Transferred Employee" for
purposes hereunder as of the date of such individuals return to active
employment with the Business (such date, the " _Commencement Date_ ").

(c) Where applicable Law or rules provide for the transfer of employment of
any Business Employee upon a sale of the Business, Purchaser and Seller shall
take or cause to be taken such actions as are required under applicable Law to
accomplish such transfer of employment of such Business Employee to Purchaser
or an Affiliate of Purchaser as a matter of Law as of the Closing. Where
applicable Law or rules do not provide for the transfer of employment of any
Business Employee upon the sale of the Business to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make
offers of at-will (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) employment in
accordance with the provisions of this Article IX, to be effective as of the
Closing, to all such Business Employees.

(d) To the extent not provided for by operation of Law, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, make offers of at-will (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) employment to the Business Employees
(subject to Section 9.01(b)), in accordance with the provisions of this
Article IX, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date (or such
longer period required by applicable Law, collective bargaining agreement,
trade union agreement or works council agreement), to be effective as of the
Closing. Except as otherwise provided in this Article IX, each offer of
employment by Purchaser or its Affiliate to each Business Employee shall in
each case provide a base salary (or wages) and bonus target no less favorable
than the base salary and bonus target provided to such Business Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and such other terms and conditions
(including, but not limited to, pension and welfare benefits, but excluding
stock-based compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to such Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not
be obligated to offer or to provide any defined benefit pension plan except
where required by applicable Law, collective bargaining agreement, trade union
agreement or works council agreement. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall
set forth in a Purchaser Disclosure Letter the employee benefits that shall be
provided to  



 

61  Transferred Employees on the Closing Date and through the Continuation
Period set forth in Section 9.05(a) on a country by country basis. Section
9.01(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name, title or job
position, base salary (or wages) and target bonus, as in effect as of the
Closing Date, with respect to each Business Employee (which Schedule is
attached to the document entitled "ConfidentialEmployee Benefit Matter
Information" (the " _Confidential Employee Benefit Letter_ ")). Each Business
Employee whose employment transfers from Seller or an Affiliate of Seller to
any Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser on the Closing by operation of
Law, and each Business Employee who accepts the offer of employment from
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, is referred to herein as a "
_Transferred Employee_ ". Transferred Employees who are employed primarily
within the United States or Puerto Rico immediately prior to the Closing are
referred to herein as " _U.S. Transferred Employees_ ". Transferred Employees
who are employed primarily outside of the United States and Puerto Rico
immediately prior to the Closing are referred to herein as " _Foreign
Transferred Employees_ ". If any Transferred Employee requires a work permit
or an employment pass or other approval for his or her employment to continue
with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser following the Closing or the
Commencement Date, as applicable, Purchaser shall use its, or shall cause its
Affiliate to use its, commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any
necessary applications are promptly made and to secure prior to Closing or the
Commencement Date, as applicable, the necessary permit, pass or other
approval.

(e) Without limiting Purchasers obligations under Section 9.01(d), Purchaser
or an Affiliate of Purchaser, as the case may be, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make the offers of employment described in Section
9.01(d) on terms and conditions sufficient to avoid statutory severance or
similar obligations under applicable Law, except to the extent such severance
or similar obligations arise without regard to such terms. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Article IX to the contrary, if applicable Law
requires Seller or its Affiliates to make any payment or provide any benefit
to any Business Employee in the event Purchaser and its Affiliates do not
offer to provide such Business Employee with a specified level of compensation
or benefits, then Purchaser and its Affiliates shall offer to provide such
level of compensation or benefits to the extent necessary to prevent Seller
and its Affiliates from being so obligated to such Business Employee. Seller
and Purchaser intend that for purposes of any severance or termination benefit
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Seller and its Affiliates,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute a
severance of employment of any Transferred Employee prior to or upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that Transferred
Employees will have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately
before, during and immediately following the Closing. Purchaser shall assume
and be solely responsible for all obligations, liabilities and commitments in
respect of claims made by any Business Employee for severance or other
termination pay or other benefits (including, but not limited to, claims for
wrongful dismissal, constructive dismissal, notice of termination of
employment, pay in lieu of notice or termination, termination indemnities or
other indemnities, any damages arising from a breach of a Business Employees
employment contract, and any payments required to be made under any Law of any
jurisdiction or the applicable collective bargaining agreement in respect of
the termination of the Business Employees employment, including payments in
respect of accrued wages, vacation, overtime, bonuses and other plans,
programs or obligations) arising out of, relating to or in connection
with (i) Purchasers failure to offer employment to any Business Employee (or
failure to continue the employment of any Business Employee of a Transferred
Entity) or failure to offer or continue  



 

62  employment on terms and conditions which would preclude any claims of
constructive dismissal or similar claims under any applicable Law or other
failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) where any such
severance or termination benefits are required to be paid under applicable Law
upon the Closing without regard to such terms and conditions or such
continuation of employment. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against all Losses which
Seller may suffer or incur as a result of any claim, action or any proceeding
made by any Business Employee against Seller or its Affiliates from and after
the Closing Date or arising from any breach of Purchasers obligations under
Section 9.01.

(f) Seller and Purchaser and its Affiliates acknowledge and agree that under
the provisions implementing Council Directive 2001/23/EC (the " _Acquired
Rights Directive_ "), the contracts of employment between Seller and/or its
Affiliates and the Foreign Transferred Employees and, subject to applicable
Law, any labor or collective bargaining agreement or works council agreement
shall have effect for the Foreign Transferred Employees employed primarily in
Europe as if originally made between Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and
the Foreign Transferred Employees or between Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates and the other parties to the labor or collective bargaining
agreements or works council agreements (as the case may be). 

(g) As of the Closing, Purchaser shall assume, or shall cause an Affiliate of
Purchaser to assume, any labor or collective bargaining agreements, works
council agreements or trade union agreements in effect with respect to any
Foreign Transferred Employee.

SECTION 9.02.  _Assumption of Liabilities._ (a) Unless otherwise expressly
provided in this Article IX, Seller and its Affiliates shall retain liability
and responsibility for all employment, compensation, severance and employee
benefit-related Liabilities, obligations and commitments (including, but not
limited to, claims for wrongful dismissal, constructive dismissal, unfair
dismissal, notice of termination of employment, pay in lieu of notice or
termination, termination indemnities or other indemnities, any damages
arising from a breach of a Business Employees or Former Business Employees
employment contract, and any payments required to be made under any Law of any
jurisdiction or the applicable collective bargaining agreement in respect of
the termination of a Business Employees or Former Business Employees
employment, including payments in respect of accrued wages, vacation,
overtime, bonuses and other plans, programs or obligations) (i) arising prior
to the Closing Date that relate to any current or former officer, director,
employee or independent contractor of the Business including any Former
Business Employee or any Business Employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof); (ii) or arising on or after the Closing Date that
relate to any Business Employee to whom Seller and its Affiliates offer
employment between the date hereof and the Closing; or (iii) arising between
the Closing Date and the Commencement Date that relate to any Inactive
Business Employee.

(b) (i) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Article IX, effective as
of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Purchaser
to, assume and be solely responsible and liable for all employment,
compensation, severance and employee benefit-related Liabilities, obligations
and commitments arising on or after the Closing Date (including, but not
limited to, claims for wrongful dismissal, constructive dismissal, unfair
dismissal, notice  



 

63  of termination of employment, pay in lieu of notice of termination,
termination indemnities or other indemnities, any damages arising from a
breach of a Transferred Employees, Business Employees or Former Business
Employee of a Transferred Entitys employment contract, and any payments
required to be made under any Law of any jurisdiction or the applicable
collective bargaining agreement in respect of the termination of a
Transferred Employee, or Former Business Employee of a Transferred Entitys
employment including payments in respect of accrued wages, vacation, overtime,
bonuses and other plans, programs or obligations) that relate to any
Transferred Employee or such Former Business Employee; (ii) Seller and its
Affiliates shall, solely in relation to obligations triggered by the sale of
the Business, including the sale of any Transferred Entity, retain all
Liabilities and responsibilities arising from Sellers and its Affiliates
failure to perform and discharge any obligation and requirement of Seller or
its Affiliates to inform and consult with any works council or union
or employee representatives and under the Acquired Rights Directive or under
transfer of undertakings in the applicable foreign jurisdiction prior to the
Closing that relate to any Former Business Employee, Business Employee or
Transferred Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) incurred prior
to, on or after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate
of Purchaser to, solely in relation to obligations triggered by the sale of
the Business, including the sale of any Transferred Entity, assume all
Liabilities and responsibilities arising from Purchasers or its Affiliates
failure to perform and discharge any obligation or requirement of Purchaser or
its Affiliate to inform and consult with any works council or union or
employee representatives and under the Acquired Rights Directive or under
transfer of undertakings in the applicable foreign jurisdiction prior to
Closing that relate to any Former Business Employee, Business Employee of
a Transferred Entity or Transferred Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof) incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date.

(c) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be liable for Liabilities relating to
the litigations and claims set forth in Section 9.02(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

(d) Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all liabilities and obligations for
all workers compensation, short- and long-term disability, medical,
prescription drug, dental, vision, life insurance, accidental death and
dismemberment and other welfare benefit claims incurred by Business Employees
(other than Business Employees of any Transferred Entity) prior to the Closing
Date or incurred by Inactive Business Employees prior to becoming
Transferred Employees that are covered under the terms of the applicable
plans of Seller or its Affiliates. With respect to claims incurred prior to
the Closing with respect to Business Employees of the Transferred Entities and
with respect to claims incurred on or after the Closing Date or the
Commencement Date, as applicable, by the Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents for workers compensation, short- and long-term
disability, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, life insurance,
accidental death and dismemberment and other welfare benefit claims,
Purchaser, or its Affiliates, shall be responsible. For these purposes, a
claim shall be deemed to be incurred: (i) in the case of workers compensation
and short- or long-term disability benefits (including related health
benefits), at the time of the injury, sickness or other event giving rise to
the claim for such benefits; (ii) in the case of medical, prescription drug,
dental or vision benefits, at the time professional services, equipment or
prescription drugs covered by the applicable plan are obtained; (iii) in the
case of life insurance benefits, upon death; and (iv) in the case of
accidental death and dismemberment benefits, at the time of the accident. For
the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
 



 

64  herein, this Section 9.02(d) shall not apply to any claims, Liabilities or
obligations arising out of or relating to exposure of any Business
Employee, Former Business Employee, Transferred Employee or former employee
or independent contractor of the Transferred Entities or the Business to
Hazardous Materials, which matters shall be addressed exclusively by the
provisions of Sections 1.03(a)(ii) and 4.17 herein.

(e) Except as specifically set forth in this Article IX or required by
applicable Law, collective bargaining agreement, trade union agreement or
works council agreement: (i) none of Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall be
obligated to assume, continue or maintain any of the Benefit Plans that are
sponsored or maintained by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than a
Transferred Entity); (ii) no assets or Liabilities of any such Benefit Plans
shall be transferred to, or assumed by, Purchaser or its Affiliates or their
respective benefit plans; and (iii) Seller and its Affiliates (other than
the Transferred Entities) shall be solely responsible for funding and/or
paying any benefits under such Benefit Plans, including any termination
benefits and other employee entitlements accrued under such plans by or
attributable to employees of any of the Seller or its Affiliates.

(f) Seller shall indemnify and keep indemnified each of Purchaser and its
Affiliates against any Liability relating to: (i) any Liability which may be
treated as due from Purchaser or its Affiliates in relation to the trustees of
any occupational pension scheme operated for the benefit of Transferred
Employees who are employed primarily in the United Kingdom (the " _UK
Transferred Employees_ "), including the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pension Plan
(the " _Seller s UK DB Pension Plan_") and the Sellers supplemental pension
and ancillary benefits provision as described in the December 13, 2007 letter
to certain UK Transferred Employees (the " _Seller s UK Supplemental Pension
Program_") under section 75 or section 75A of the United Kingdom Pensions Act
1995 (as amended) to the extent that the Liability arises out of or in
connection with an employment cessation event (within the meaning of the
Occupational Pension Schemes (Employer Debt) Regulations 2005 (as amended)) as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) any
contribution notice or financial support direction that may be issued pursuant
to the Pensions Act 2004 in relation to any occupational pension scheme
operated prior to Closing for the benefit of the UK Transferred Employees,
including Sellers UK DB Pension Plan and Sellers UK Supplemental Pension
Program.

SECTION 9.03. _Independent Contractors._ Effective as of the Closing, (i)
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, assume all contracts,
obligations and liabilities with respect to independent contractors working
for the Business on the Closing Date and (ii) Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless against any such contracts,
liabilities, obligations or any and all Losses which Seller or its Affiliates
may suffer or incur as a result of any claim, action or other proceeding made
by such independent contractor against Seller or its Affiliates from and after
the Closing Date or arising from any breach of Purchasers obligations under
this Section 9.03.

SECTION 9.04. _Credited Service._ Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, credit service accrued by Transferred Employees with,
or otherwise recognized for purposes of benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements by, Seller or its Affiliates as of the Closing (the " _Pre-
Closing Service_ ") for all purposes (other than for benefit accrual purposes
under any  



 

65  defined benefit pension plan of Purchaser or its Affiliates unless required
by applicable Law) under the benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements (including any pension, 401(k), savings, profit-sharing,
medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, vacation bonus, seniority payment,
post-retirement health and life insurance, equity, severance, indemnification
or separation pay plans and benefits under the applicable collective
bargaining agreement) of Purchaser and its Affiliates.

SECTION 9.05. _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits._ (a) Without
limiting the generality of Section 9.01, from the Closing Date through at
least December 31, 2009 (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser shall (except as otherwise required by applicable Law,
collective bargaining agreement, trade union agreement or works council
agreement) provide each Transferred Employee with base salary (or wages) and
bonus target that in each case is no less favorable than the base salary (or
wages) and bonus target provided to such Transferred Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date. During the Continuation Period, Purchaser shall
maintain, or cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to maintain, employee benefits
and compensation plans (excluding equity compensation plans), programs,
arrangements, and perquisites for the Transferred Employees that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Transferred Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be obligated to maintain any defined
benefit pension plan except where required by applicable Law, collective
bargaining agreement, trade union agreement or works council agreement.

(b) Purchaser shall provide, or cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to provide, to
each U.S. Transferred Employee whose employment terminates during the
Continuation Period, cash severance benefits equal to the greater of (x) the
cash severance payable, if any, under the applicable severance plan of
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser s Severance Plan_")
based on the eligibility criteria applicable under Purchasers Severance Plan
as then in effect, and subject to the terms and conditions of Purchasers
Severance Plan, or (y) the cash severance payable, if any, under the terms
and conditions set forth in Section 9.05(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
based on the eligibility criteria, and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in Section 9.05(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. With respect to
any U.S. Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated during the
Continuation Period, Purchaser shall further provide, or cause an Affiliate of
Purchaser to provide, to U.S. Transferred Employees who are entitled to cash
severance pursuant to the preceding sentence payment for all medical and
dental coverage to which such U.S. Transferred Employees are eligible pursuant
to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (" _COBRA_ ") for the
number of weeks corresponding to the number of weeks of base salary (or wages)
covered by their cash severance payments and at an employee cost no greater
than the then-current cost of such medical and dental coverage for active
employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, refrain from enticing, encouraging or requiring any U.S.
Transferred Employee to elect to receive COBRA coverage from Seller on
or following the Closing Date.

(c) Purchaser shall provide, or cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to provide, to
each Foreign Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated by Purchaser
or its Affiliates during the Continuation Period severance and other
separation benefits that are no less favorable than the severance and other
separation benefits described in Section 9.05(c) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. Purchaser shall also assume and be solely responsible for paying any
other  



 

66  severance obligations that are payable under applicable Law, collective
bargaining agreement, trade union agreement or works council agreement as a
result of termination of a Foreign Transferred Employees employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing Date. Nothing herein shall be
construed as giving any Foreign Transferred Employee any right to continued
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates following the Closing other than
as required by applicable Law, employment contracts, collective bargaining
agreements, trade union agreements or works council agreements, or as
expressly provided in this Article IX.

 

SECTION 9.06. _U.S. and Puerto Rico Savings and Investment Plans; Vesting._
(a) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.05, effective as of the
Closing Date, Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser shall have in effect (i)
a defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code intended to be
qualified pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Purchaser s U.S.
401(k) Plan_") and (ii) a defined contribution plan that includes a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code
intended to be qualified pursuant to both Section 401(a) of the Code and the
PR Code (the " _Purchaser s PR 401(k) Plan_"), which will provide during the
Continuation Period benefits, rights and features to U.S. Transferred
Employees, who immediately prior to the Closing are participants or who would
be permitted during the Continuation Period to become participants in the
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Savings and Investment Program (" _U.S. SIP_ ")
or the Bristol-Myers Squibb Puerto Rico, Inc. Savings and Investment Program
(" _PR SIP_ "), that pursuant to the terms thereof are substantially identical
in all material respects (except for such changes as may be required by Law
or as provided below) to those provided by the U.S. SIP and the PR SIP
immediately prior to the Closing. Each U.S. Transferred Employee participating
in the U.S. SIP or the PR SIP immediately prior to the Closing shall become a
participant in Purchasers U.S. 401(k) Plan or Purchasers PR 401(k) Plan (as
applicable) as of the Closing. U.S. Transferred Employees shall receive credit
for all service with Seller and its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility
and vesting under Purchasers U.S. 401(k) Plan and Purchasers PR 401(k) Plan
(as applicable).

(b) At such time as Seller is reasonably satisfied that Purchasers 401(k)
Plan meets the requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code
and that Purchasers PR 401(k) Plan meets the requirements for qualification
under both Section 401(a) of the Code and the PR Code, Seller shall cause the
U.S. SIP and the PR SIP to transfer to the trusts that form a part of
Purchasers 401(k) Plan and Purchasers PR 401(k) Plan (as applicable) cash,
assets (including shares of Seller common stock, to the extent U.S.
Transferred Employees accounts are invested in Seller common stock) or a
combination thereof (the " _Asset Transfer_ ") in an amount equal to the
account balances of the U.S. Transferred Employees (including any promissory
notes evidencing outstanding loan balances under the U.S. SIP and the PR SIP)
as of the valuation date for the U.S. SIP and the PR SIP next preceding such
transfer, and Purchaser shall cause Purchasers 401(k) Plan and Purchasers
PR 401(k) Plan (as applicable) to accept such transfer. Seller shall debit the
accounts of each U.S. Transferred Employee under the U.S. SIP and the PR SIP
by the amount transferred to Purchasers 401(k) Plan and Purchasers PR
401(k) Plan, and Purchaser shall allocate the cash and property transferred to
Purchasers 401(k) Plan and Purchasers PR 401(k) Plan to the accounts of U.S.
Transferred Employees by crediting such accounts in relative proportion to
the amount debited from the U.S. Transferred Employees accounts under the
U.S. SIP and the PR SIP. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Purchasers 401(k) Plan and Purchasers PR 401(k) Plan shall maintain an
investment option  



 

67  consisting primarily of investments in Sellers common stock (the " _Seller
s Stock Fund_") for a period of no fewer than twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that U.S. Transferred Employees
participating in Purchasers 401(k) Plan and Purchasers PR 401(k) Plan will
be permitted to transfer amounts out of Sellers Stock Fund, but no
additional amounts will be permitted to be invested in or transferred into
Sellers Stock Fund.

(c) Following such Asset Transfer, Purchaser and/or Purchasers 401(k) Plan
and Purchasers PR 401(k) Plan shall assume all liabilities and obligations of
Seller and its Affiliates under the U.S. SIP and the PR SIP with respect to
U.S. Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries, and Seller and its
Affiliates shall have no further liability to Purchaser or any U.S.
Transferred Employees with respect thereto. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
Seller and its Affiliates and the U.S. SIP and the PR SIP harmless against
any such liabilities, obligations, benefits, acts, omissions and transactions.

(d) Purchaser shall assume all liability with respect to benefits under
Sellers Benefit Equalization Plan  Savings and Investment Program that are
accrued prior to the Closing Date with respect to U.S. Transferred Employees
who participate in such plan.

(e) Seller shall take all action necessary to provide that all U.S.
Transferred Employees who participate in the U.S. SIP or the PR SIP or the
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Retirement Income Plan or the Bristol-Myers
Squibb Puerto Rico, Inc. Retirement Income Plan have a fully vested and non-
forfeitable right to their entire account balances or entire accrued benefit,
as applicable, under such plans as of the Closing Date.

SECTION 9.07. _U.S. Medical and Dental Plans._ (a) Without limiting
the generality of Section 9.05, effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall
make available to each U.S. Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) who is enrolled immediately prior to the Closing in the medical,
dental and prescription drug benefit plans and programs of Seller and its
Affiliates (collectively, " _Seller s Health Plans_") participation in
medical, dental and prescription drug plans and programs maintained or
contributed to by Purchaser or its Affiliates (collectively, " _Purchaser s
Health Plans_"). Purchasers Health Plans shall provide, during the
Continuation Period, benefits to each U.S. Transferred Employee that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided under Sellers
Health Plans. Any and all waiting periods and pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements shall be waived under Purchasers
Health Plans with respect to the U.S. Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents, to the extent such employee or dependent was not subject
to any such waiting periods, exclusions or requirements under a similar
Sellers Health Plan in which such employee or dependent participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date. In addition, Purchaser shall cause
Purchasers Health Plans to recognize any out-of-pocket medical and dental
expenses incurred by the U.S. Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents prior to the Closing and during the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductibles and out-
of-pocket maximums under Purchasers Health Plans, to the same extent so
recognized under a similar Sellers Health Plan prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, (A) Seller agrees to provide or cause to be provided to each
individual who retires on or after the Closing Date and who was, immediately
prior to the Closing Date, formerly employed by Seller  



 

68  or its Affiliates in connection with the Business and each Business Employee
who is eligible to retire on or immediately prior to the Closing (and
such employees eligible dependents) retiree health care benefits and
coverage set forth in the Comprehensive Medical Summary Plan Description of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or such other retiree benefit plan or
arrangement of Seller or its Affiliates that is applicable to such individual
or employee immediately prior to the Closing ( " _Seller s Retiree Health
Plan_") with such retiree health care benefits and coverage set forth in the
Sellers Retiree Health Plan; and (B) Purchaser shall provide or cause to be
provided under Purchasers Health Plans to each U.S. Transferred Employee (and
his or her eligible dependents) who is not described in the immediately
preceding clause (A), but who would have satisfied the eligibility
requirements for retiree health care benefits and coverage set forth in
Sellers Retiree Health Plan within the Continuation Period had such
Transferred Employees service as an employee of Purchaser or its Affiliate
during the Continuation Period been service as an employee of Seller or its
Affiliate, and who retires on or after the Closing Date and during the
Continuation Period either (i) health care benefits and coverage that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those set forth in Sellers
Retiree Health Plan (or that would have been applicable had such U.S.
Transferred Employee been eligible to retire immediately prior to the Closing)
without regard to any Rule of 70 benefit, or (ii) if more favorable to such
U.S. Transferred Employee than the foregoing, the health care benefits and
coverage that are provided to similarly situated retirees of Purchaser and its
Affiliates; _provided_ that such U.S. Transferred Employees participation
cost shall be taken into account for purposes of determining whether benefits
and coverage are no less favorable or more favorable. Nothing herein shall
prevent Seller from amending Sellers Retiree Health Plan (subject to Section
5.02), or Purchaser from amending its retiree health plans (subject to Section
9.05) at any time in its sole discretion.

(c) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have in effect health care and
dependent care flexible spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan
qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (" _Purchaser s Cafeteria Plan_"),
which will provide, during the Continuation Period, benefits, rights and
features to U.S. Transferred Employees that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided under the health care and dependent care
flexible spending reimbursement account plans of Seller and its Affiliates ("
_Seller s Cafeteria Plan_") immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall
cause Purchasers Cafeteria Plan to accept a spin-off of the flexible
spending reimbursement accounts of each U.S. Transferred Employee who
participates in Sellers Cafeteria Plan immediately prior to the Closing
(each, an " _FSA Participant_ ") and to honor and continue through December
31 of the year in which the Closing occurs (the " _FSA Participation Period_
") the elections made by each FSA Participant under Sellers Cafeteria Plan in
respect of such flexible spending reimbursement accounts that are in effect
immediately prior to the Closing. As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall cause to be transferred in cash from
Sellers Cafeteria Plan to Purchasers Cafeteria Plan the excess, if any, of
the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement
accounts made by FSA Participants prior to the Closing during the year in
which the Closing occurs over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made to the
FSA Participants prior to the Closing for such year from such accounts. From
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for
all claims by FSA Participants under Sellers Cafeteria Plan incurred at any
time during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, whether incurred
prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have not been paid in full as of
the Closing Date. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim for reimbursement
shall be deemed to have been incurred on the date on which the charge or
expense giving rise to such claim is incurred.



 

69 (d) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall assume and be solely
responsible for all liabilities and obligations under COBRA with respect to
each U.S. Transferred Employee, and his or her qualified beneficiaries, who is
eligible to elect "continuation coverage" (as such term is defined under
Section 602 of ERISA) or any similar benefit under any state Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall assume and be
solely responsible for the provision of health care coverage after the Closing
to U.S. Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries that satisfies the
continuation coverage requirements imposed in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by Section 4980B of the Code.

SECTION 9.08. _U.S. Short-Term Disability and Long-Term Disability._ Without
limiting the generality of Section 9.05, effective as of the Closing,
Purchaser shall make available to each U.S. Transferred Employee who is
enrolled immediately prior to the Closing in the short-term disability plans
and long-term disability plans of Seller and its Affiliates (collectively, "
_Seller s Disability Plans_") participation in short-term disability plans
and long-term disability plans maintained or established by Purchaser
(collectively, " _Purchaser s Disability Plans_"). Purchasers Disability
Plans shall provide, during the Continuation Period, benefits to each U.S.
Transferred Employee that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided under Sellers Disability Plans.

SECTION 9.09. _U.S. Life and Accident Insurance._ (a) Without limiting the
generality of Section 9.05, effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall make
available to each U.S. Transferred Employee who is enrolled immediately prior
to the Closing in the life insurance and accident insurance plans of Seller
and its Affiliates (collectively, " _Seller s Life and Accident Insurance
Plans_") participation in life insurance and accident insurance
plans maintained or established by Purchaser (collectively, " _Purchaser s
Life and Accident Insurance Plans_"). Purchasers Life and Accident Insurance
Plans shall provide, during the Continuation Period, benefits to each
U.S. Transferred Employee that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to those provided under Sellers Life and Accident Insurance Plans.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (A)
Seller agrees to provide or cause to be provided to each individual who
retires on or after the Closing Date and who was, immediately prior to the
Closing Date, formerly employed by Seller or its Affiliates in connection
with the Business and each Business Employee who is eligible to retire on or
immediately prior to the Closing (and such employees eligible dependents)
retiree life insurance benefits and coverage under Sellers Life and Accident
Insurance Plans, or such other retiree benefit plan or arrangement of Seller
or its Affiliates that is applicable to such individual or employee
immediately prior to the Closing ( " _Seller s Retiree Life and Accident
Insurance Plan_") with retiree life insurance benefits and coverage under
Sellers Retiree Life and Accident Insurance Plans; and (B) Purchaser agrees
to provide or cause to be provided under Purchasers Life and Accident
Insurance Plans to each U.S. Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) who is not described in the immediately preceding clause (A), but
who would have satisfied the eligibility requirements for retiree insurance
coverage set forth in the Sellers Retiree Life and Accident Insurance Plan
within the Continuation Period had such  



 

70  Transferred Employees service as an employee of Purchaser or its Affiliate
during the Continuation Period been service as an employee of Seller or
its Affiliate, and who retires on or after the Closing Date and during the
Continuation Period either (i) life insurance benefits and coverage that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those under Sellers Retiree Life
and Accident Insurance Plans (or that would have been applicable had such
U.S. Transferred Employee been eligible to retire immediately prior to the
Closing) or (ii) if more favorable to such Employee than the foregoing, the
life insurance benefits and coverage that are provided to similarly situated
retirees of Purchaser and its Affiliates; _provided_ that such U.S.
Transferred Employees participation cost shall be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether benefits and coverage are no less favorable
or more favorable. Nothing herein shall prevent Seller from amending Sellers
Retiree Life and Accident Insurance Plan (subject to Section 5.02), or
Purchaser from amending its retiree life and accident insurance plans
(subject to Section 9.05), at any time in its sole discretion.

SECTION 9.10. _Performance Bonuses._ Purchaser shall, to the extent accrued
therefor in the Financial Statements, assume and be solely responsible for all
liabilities under, and shall make any and all payments required to be made
pursuant to, the cash performance and incentive plans and
related administrative guidelines and procedures of Seller and its Affiliates
(" _Seller s Incentive Plans_") with respect to the Transferred Employees
where such liabilities and/or payments relate to performance periods in which
the Closing Date occurs or that have ended but have not been paid prior to
the Closing, to the extent true and complete copies of all Sellers Incentive
Plans have been provided to Purchaser prior to the date hereof. Purchaser
agrees to calculate and make such payments pursuant to the terms and
conditions of such Sellers Incentive Plans. Section 9.10 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the threshold target and maximum bonus for each
Business Employee under such Sellers Incentive Plans for the calendar year
2008 (which Schedule is attached to the Confidential Employee Benefit Letter).

SECTION 9.11. _Relocation Benefits._ With respect to each Transferred
Employee who, as of the Closing, is in the process of undergoing a relocation
and who is identified in Section 9.11 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (which
Schedule is attached to the Confidential Employee Benefit Letter), Purchaser
shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to, provide relocation
benefits that are identical, in all material respects, to Sellers relocation
benefits, at the expense of Purchaser or its Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Section 9.11 shall require Purchaser or its
Affiliates to be liable for any relocation costs incurred prior to the Closing
Date. With respect to each Transferred Employee who is on expatriate
assignment as of the Closing and who is identified in Section 9.11 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide repatriation benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than Sellers repatriation benefits in effect immediately prior to the
Closing.

SECTION 9.12. _Vacation Benefits._  Upon termination of employment with
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser on or after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall pay each Transferred Employee (other than a Transferred Employee of a
Transferred Entity) for any vacation days banked (but excluding any vacation
days taken) through the Closing and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
or the terms of the applicable vacation policy, any vacation days accrued (but
excluding any vacation days taken) through the Closing. To the extent the
payment of accrued vacation described in the immediately preceding sentence is
not required to  



 

71  be made, Purchaser shall assume and honor all vacation days accrued but not
yet taken by Transferred Employees as of the Closing, to the extent of
the liabilities accrued therefor in the Financial Statement (it being
understood that Purchaser and its Affiliates may deduct from the number of
vacation days made available to any Transferred Employee the number of days of
vacation previously taken by such Transferred Employee in the applicable
year). In the event that any Transferred Employee has taken more vacation days
than he or she has accrued as of the Closing, neither Purchaser nor its
Affiliates shall have any obligation to reimburse Seller in respect thereof.

SECTION 9.13. _Employment and Other Agreements._ Effective as of the Closing,
Purchaser shall (i) assume all Liabilities arising in accordance with all
employment agreements, supplemental benefit agreements and other agreements
which have been entered into between a Transferred Employee, on the one hand,
and Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand, (which agreements not
required to be assumed under applicable Law, collective bargaining agreement,
trade union agreement or works council agreement are set forth in Section 9.13
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule), and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates against any such liabilities.

SECTION 9.14. _Retention Arrangements._  Seller shall retain the economic
obligations under the retention bonus arrangements of Seller and its
Affiliates that are payable before the Closing Date and are identified in
Section 9.14 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Purchaser shall retain the
economic obligations under retention bonus arrangements of Seller and/or
Purchaser and their respective Affiliates that are payable at any time on or
following the Closing Date and are identified in Section 9.14 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule.

SECTION 9.15. _Other Programs and Benefits._ Effective as of the Closing,
Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for all Liabilities with
respect to (a) tuition assistance programs, (b) automobile policies, (c)
statutory benefits and (d) expatriate allowances, including foreign or U.S.
tax payments and tax equalization payments, in each case provided to
Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries by Seller and its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing and, except for statutory benefits, are
listed on Section 9.15 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

SECTION 9.16. _U.S. WARN Act and Other Notices._ Purchaser agrees to provide
any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act (" _WARN_ ") and any similar state or other applicable Law and to
otherwise comply with any such requirement with respect to any "plant closing"
or "mass layoff" (as defined in WARN) or similar event affecting Employees
and occurring on or after the Closing Date. With regard to applicable Laws
other than those of the United States, Purchaser agrees to provide notice and
to inform and consult with workers, their representative bodies and
any relevant Governmental Entities as required by applicable Law in relation
to the transactions contemplated herein. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates against any such liabilities relating to
Purchaser and its Affiliates obligations under this Section 9.16.

SECTION 9.17. _Special Provisions for Foreign Transferred Employees._  (a)
_Foreign Health and Welfare Plans._ Without limiting the generality of Section
9.05, effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall have in effect health and
welfare plans for the benefit of  



 

72  Foreign Transferred Employees (" _Purchaser s Foreign Health and Welfare
Plans_"). Purchasers Foreign Health and Welfare Plans shall provide
benefits, during the Continuation Period to each Foreign Transferred Employee,
that (i) are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided under the
health and welfare plans and programs maintained or contributed to by
Seller and its Affiliates that are applicable to such Foreign Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) meet the requirements of
applicable Law with respect to continuity of benefits. With respect to any of
Purchasers Foreign Health and Welfare Plans, any and all waiting periods and
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements shall be
waived with respect to the Foreign Transferred Employees, to the extent such
employee was not subject to any such waiting periods, exclusions or
requirements under a similar plan or program of Seller or its Affiliates in
which such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(b) _Foreign Pension Plans._ Without limiting the generality of Section 9.05,
effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall have in effect retirement plans
for the benefit of Foreign Transferred Employees (" _Purchaser s Foreign
Retirement Plans_") that provide benefits, during the Continuation Period to
each Foreign Transferred Employee, that (i) are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided under the pension plans and programs maintained
or contributed to by Seller and its Affiliates (" _Seller s Foreign
Retirement Plans_") that are applicable to such Foreign Transferred Employee
immediately prior to the Closing subject to the Foreign Transferred Employees
paying contributions under Purchasers Foreign Retirement Plans at no greater
rate than under Sellers Foreign Retirement Plans and (ii) meet
the requirements of applicable Law with respect to continuity of benefits.
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against
all Losses incurred by Seller in respect of any claims by Foreign Transferred
Employees relating to any changes in their pension benefits as of the
Closing.

SECTION 9.18. _Personnel Records._ To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the originals of all records created prior to the Closing Date (or such later
date of transfer of employment, as applicable) set forth in the Transferred
Employees personnel files shall remain with the Transferred Entity or be
transferred to Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates (as of the Closing Date or
such later date of transfer of employment, as applicable), as the case may be
(the " _Personnel Records_ "). The originals of all personnel records of all
Former Business Employees and all Business Employees who are not Transferred
Employees shall remain with Seller and its Affiliates; _provided_ that
Purchaser shall be provided with a copy of all employee health and safety
records required by applicable Law to be maintained by the Transferred
Entities and Seller shall permit Purchaser or its Affiliates or successors and
their authorized representatives to have full access to all such personnel
records to the extent reasonably necessary in order for Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates or successors to respond to a subpoena, court order, audit,
investigation or otherwise as required by applicable Law or in connection with
any pending or threatened lawsuits, actions, arbitrations, claims,
complaints, investigations or other proceedings. Purchaser or Purchasers
Affiliates (or their respective successors) shall retain the Personnel Records
for a period of at least ten (10) years following the Closing Date (the "
_Retention Period_ "). Purchaser and its Affiliates shall permit Seller and
its authorized representatives to have full access upon reasonable notice
during normal business hours to all the Personnel Records during the
Retention Period in order for Seller or any of its Affiliates to respond to a
subpoena, court order, audit, investigation, to obtain data for pension or
other benefits, or otherwise as required by applicable Law (such determination
by the parties of access shall be reasonable and shall not be unreasonably
delayed) and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall provide Seller, upon Sellers
reasonable request and at Sellers expense, with copies of such Personnel
records.



 

73 SECTION 9.19. _No Third Party Remedies._ Nothing in this Article IX is
intended or shall be intended to entitle any person other than the parties
hereto and their respective transferees and permitted assigns to any claim,

75 SECTION 10.02. _Indemnification by Purchaser._ From and after the Closing,
Purchaser and the Transferred Entities shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify Seller and its Affiliates (other than any Transferred Entity) and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives and permitted successors and assigns (the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ ") against and hold them harmless from any Loss suffered or
incurred by any such Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising from (a) any

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller against (i)

applicable to the Acquisition, (iv) the breach of any covenant or
other agreement of Purchaser contained in Section 8.07 and (v) any Taxes
relating to the Acquired Assets allocated to Purchaser under Section
1.03(a)(viii). The Purchasers liability for Transfer Taxes under this clause
10.03(b) shall be limited to the first $10,000,000 of Transfer Taxes. For the
avoidance of doubt, amounts paid by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.07(h)
shall be credited against Purchasers obligation to indemnify for any value
added Taxes (or similar Taxes) under this Section 10.03(b).

(c) Any indemnity payment to be made hereunder shall be paid within ten (10)
days after the indemnified party makes written demand upon the indemnifying
party, but in no case earlier than five (5) business days prior to the date on
which the relevant Taxes (including any estimated Tax payments) are required

76 (d) Any Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period on a closing of the books basis,
except that in the case of Taxes, deductions or credits determined on a
periodic basis, the amount of Tax, deduction or credit shall be allocated on a
daily pro rata basis. These principles shall apply for the purposes of
allocating any Taxes applicable to the Acquired Assets for the purposes of
Article I and for allocating any refunds or credits of Tax.

that liability is also a liability of Purchaser under Section
10.03(b)(ii)-(v). Purchaser shall have no liability under Section 10.03(b)(i)
to the extent that liability is also a liability of Seller under Section
10.03(a)(ii)-(v).

SECTION 10.04.  _Limitations on Liability; Cooperation._ (a) Notwithstanding
any provision herein, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall in any event be
liable to the other party or its Affiliates or Representatives on account of
any indemnity obligation set forth in Section 10.01 or Section 10.02 for any
indirect, consequential, special, incidental or punitive damages (including
lost profits, loss of use, damage to goodwill or loss of business), other than
to the extent such damages arise out of a breach of Section 4.06 and result
in a diminution of value that is proximate and reasonably foreseeable.

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability.

(c) Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing occur,
its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to
this Agreement, any Other Transaction Document, the Acquisition, any document
or certificate delivered in connection herewith, the Business, the Transferred
Entities, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities or any Federal,
state, local or foreign Law or otherwise (other than claims of, or causes of
action arising from, fraud) or Environmental Law (including CERCLA) shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law or Environmental
Law (including CERCLA), any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) it or
any of its Affiliates may have against Seller and its Affiliates arising under
or based upon this Agreement, any Other Transaction Document, the Acquisition,
any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, the Business,
the Transferred Entities, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities or
any Federal, state, local or foreign Law or otherwise or Environmental Law
(including CERCLA) (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article X). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 10.04
shall not preclude the Purchaser Indemnitees from pursuing the remedies of
specific performance, injunctive relief, non-monetary declaratory judgment or
any other non-monetary equitable remedies available to the Purchaser
Indemnitees under applicable Law or Environmental Law.

SECTION 10.05. _Indemnity Net; Losses Net of Insurance, Etc._ (a) For the
purposes of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X, any
Losses or amounts  



 

77  otherwise payable hereunder (including amounts relating to Taxes pursuant to
Section 10.03) as reduced under Section 10.05(b) shall be determined on the
basis of the net effect after giving effect to any actual cash payments,
setoffs or recoupment or any payments in each case actually received, realized
or retained by the indemnified party (including any amounts recovered or
recoverable by the indemnified party under insurance policies) as a result of
any event giving rise to a claim for such indemnification.

(b) The amount of any Loss or amount relating to Taxes pursuant to Section
10.03 for which indemnification is provided under this Article X shall be
reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit (including as a result of any
basis adjustment) actually realized by the indemnified party on or before the
taxable year to which the indemnification relates arising from the incurrence
or payment of any such Loss or amount relating to Taxes pursuant to Section
10.03. In computing the amount of any Loss or amount relating to Taxes
pursuant to Section 10.03, the indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize
all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing
any item arising from the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss or
amount relating to Taxes pursuant to Section 10.03.

SECTION 10.06. _Termination of Indemnification._  (a) The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto pursuant to (i) Sections
10.01(a)(i) and 10.02(a), as each relates to breaches of representations and
warranties, shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty
terminates pursuant to paragraph (b) below, (ii) Section 10.01(a)(i) and
10.02(a), as each relates to breaches of covenants, shall terminate at the
close of business on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (iii) the
other clauses of Sections 10.01 and 10.02 shall not terminate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that as to clause (i) and (ii) of this sentence such obligations
to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item
as to which the person to be indemnified or the related party thereto shall
have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim
by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis
of such claim) to the indemnifying party.

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement and in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing
solely for purposes of Sections 10.01 and 10.02 and shall terminate at the
close of business on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided_ that (i) the representations in relation to Tax contained in
Section 4.07 shall terminate at Closing and (ii) the Fundamental
Representations shall terminate on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing
Date.

SECTION 10.07. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party
Claims._ (a) In order for a party (the " _indemnified party_ ") to be
entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect
of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any person against
the indemnified party other than claims for Taxes which are addressed
by Section 10.09 (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such indemnified party must
notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the
Third Party Claim within ten (10) business days after receipt by
such indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_
, _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party
shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the
period in which the indemnified party failed to give such notice). Thereafter,
the  



 

78  indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly after
the indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating
to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel is not
reasonably objected to by the indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party
so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party
shall not be liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel (not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it
being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying
party has failed to assume the defense thereof (other than during the period
prior to the time the indemnified party shall have given notice of the Third
Party Claim as provided above). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.07
to the contrary, (i) if such Third Party Claim would give rise to Losses that
are more than 250% the amount indemnifiable by such indemnifying
party pursuant to this Article X, then the indemnified party may elect to
retain control of such defense, provided its legal fees and expenses shall be
at its own expense and shall not be indemnified pursuant to this Article X,
and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and (ii) if the claim for indemnification with respect to a Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment or investigation, the indemnified party shall be entitled
to jointly control the defense thereof with the indemnifying party (and to
employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party, at its own
expense) for so long as such criminal proceeding, action, indictment or
investigation is continuing.

(c) If the indemnifying party so elects to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim, all of the indemnified parties shall cooperate with the
indemnifying party in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying partys request) the
provision to the indemnifying party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not
the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim without the
indemnifying partys prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.
If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a
Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its
terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability
in connection with such Third Party Claim and which releases the indemnified
party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim. 



 

79 SECTION 10.08. _Procedures Related to Indemnification for Other Claims._ In
the event any indemnified party should have a claim against any indemnifying
party under Section 10.01 or 10.02 that does not involve a Third Party Claim
being asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified party
or does not otherwise involve a Tax claim, the resolution of which is
governed by Section 10.09, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such
claim to the indemnifying party promptly after obtaining knowledge of such
claim. The failure by any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may
have to such indemnified party under Section 10.01 or 10.02, except to the
extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been prejudiced
by such failure. If the indemnifying party disputes its liability with respect
to such claim, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed
in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation
in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

SECTION 10.09.  _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims._ (a)
If a claim relating to Taxes shall be made against any indemnified party (the
" _tax indemnified party_ ") by any taxing authority, which, if successful,
might result in an indemnity payment to any tax indemnified party pursuant to
Article X, the tax indemnified party shall promptly notify the other party
(the " _tax indemnifying party_ ") in writing of such claim (a " _Tax Claim_
"). If notice of a Tax Claim is not given to the tax indemnifying party
within a sufficient period of time to allow the tax indemnifying party to
effectively contest such Tax Claim, or in reasonable detail to apprise the tax
indemnifying party of the nature of the Tax Claim, in each case taking into
account the facts and circumstances with respect to such Tax Claim, the tax
indemnifying party shall remain liable to the tax indemnified party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the tax indemnifying party shall have no
liability under Section 10.03 to the extent that it has been actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
the tax indemnifying party shall control all proceedings taken in connection
with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel reasonably acceptable to
the tax indemnified party) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its
sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals,
proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with respect
thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue
for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax
Claim in any permissible manner. In no case shall any tax indemnified party
settle or otherwise compromise any such Tax Claim without the tax
indemnifying partys prior written consent nor shall any tax indemnifying
party settle or otherwise compromise any such Tax Claim that may adversely
affect the Tax liability of the tax indemnified party or any Affiliate
thereof without the tax indemnified partys prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld). However, in the case of a Tax Claim with respect to
amounts for which Seller could be liable under Section 10.03(a) and
that relate to a Straddle Period or a Post-Closing Tax Period, (i) neither
party shall control the proceedings and each party shall have the right to
participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax
Claim and (ii) neither party shall settle any such Tax Claim without prior
written consent of the other.

such date to no earlier than September 29, 2008 and no later than December 28,
2008 (such date, the " _Extended Termination Date_ "), in which case neither

hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by Purchaser or Seller
(including by operation of Law in connection with a merger, consolidation or
sale of all or substantially all the assets of Purchaser or Seller) without

SECTION 12.08. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed
by each of the parties and delivered to the other party. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or
other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 12.09. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, the Other Transaction
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter.

SECTION 12.10. _Fees._  Each party hereto hereby represents and warrants that
(a) the only brokers or finders that have acted for such party (and, in the
case of Seller, each Affiliate of Seller and each Transferred Entity) in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
that may be entitled to any brokerage fee, finders fee or commission in
respect thereof are Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley and Co.
Incorporated with respect to Seller, its Affiliates and the Transferred
Entities and Bear Stearns International Limited with respect to Purchaser and
(b) each party shall pay all fees or commissions which may be payable to the
firm so named with respect to such party.

SECTION 12.11. _Severability._ If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.



 

97 SECTION 12.12. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would
result and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law if any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened to be breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to equitable
relief, without the proof of actual damages, including in the form of an
injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance (including
causing Purchaser to enforce its rights under any of the Financing Letters),
in addition to all other remedies available to the parties at law or in equity
as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Each party agrees to (a)
cooperate fully in any attempt by the other party in obtaining any such
equitable remedy and (b) waive any requirement for the security or posting of
any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy. Each party further
agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any
action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or
threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement. Such equitable remedies
may be sought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New
York County (and, if such Supreme Court of the State of New York shall be
unavailable, in any other New York State court or in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York), and any appellate court
from any thereof.

SECTION 12.13. _Consent to Jurisdiction._ Each of Purchaser and Seller
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, New York County, and (b) the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any
thereof, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement, the Other Transaction Documents or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all
claims in respect of any such suit, action or other proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, in such Federal court. Each of Purchaser and Seller agrees to
commence any such action, suit or proceeding either in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or if such suit, action
or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional
reasons, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. Each
of Purchaser and Seller further agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such partys respective address
set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding in New York with respect to any matters to which it has submitted
to jurisdiction in this Section 12.13. Each of Purchaser and Seller
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Other
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in
any court referred to in the first sentence of this Section 12.13 and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

SECTION 12.14. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement,  



 

98  any of the Other Transaction Documents or any transaction contemplated
hereby or thereby. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative,
agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties
hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Other
Transaction Documents, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this Section 12.14.

SECTION 12.15. _GOVERNING LAW._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE,
WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE OTHER THAN
SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW.



 

99 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Seller and Purchaser have duly executed this Agreement as
of the date first written above.
