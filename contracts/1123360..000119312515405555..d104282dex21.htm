Merger, be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.6687 (as may be adjusted
pursuant to this 

 



-13-   _Section 2.7(b)_, the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (unless the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Mergers pursuant
to this _Section 2.7(b)_ together with _Section 2.7(d)_ would exceed 19.9%
of Parents issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time (19.9% of such issued and outstanding shares
rounded down to the nearest whole share, the " _Maximum Share Number_ ") in
which case the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced (the amount of such reduction,
the " _Exchange Ratio Reduction Number_ ") to the minimum extent necessary
such that the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
the Mergers pursuant to this _Section 2.7(b)_ together with _Section 2.7(d)_
equals the Maximum Share Number) (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (ii)
$53.28 in cash, without interest, _plus_ , solely if the Exchange Ratio is
adjusted pursuant to the preceding clause (i), the amount in cash equal to the
Exchange Ratio Reduction Number _multiplied by_ the Parent Measurement Price
(the total cash per share of Common Stock to be paid pursuant to this clause
(ii), the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration,
the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and such shares shall otherwise cease to be
outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor pursuant to
_Section 2.9(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which holders
become entitled upon the surrender of such shares of Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 2.9(c)_, without interest.

(c)

 

(i) Each share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or held
by Parent, or a Merger Sub, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Canceled Shares_ "), shall be canceled and retired without any
conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.

 

(ii) Each share of Common Stock held by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Continuing Shares_ ") shall remain outstanding.

(d) _Treatment of Equity Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Equity
Awards as contemplated under this _Section 2.7(d)_ and shall terminate,
effective as of the Closing, each of the Company Equity Plans:

(i) As to each Option (that is not an Underwater Option) that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Option shall,
by virtue of the Initial Merger and without any action on the part of any
party, be canceled and converted into the right to receive (x) the Cash
Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor pursuant to _Section
2.9(e)_) and (y) the Stock Consideration, in each case, with respect to each
whole Net Option Share relating to such Option, and the portion of the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration relating to each fractional Net
Option Share relating to such Option, in each case, as set forth in _Section
2.7(b)_ hereto.

 

(ii) As to each Option that is an Underwater Option such Option shall be
canceled and cease to exist immediately prior to the Effective Time, with no
consideration therefor.

(iii) As to each Restricted Stock Unit (other than a Performance Share Unit),
such Restricted Stock Unit shall, by virtue of the Initial Merger and without
any action on the part of any party, become fully vested and cease to be
subject to any forfeiture condition and be canceled and converted into the
right to receive (x) the Cash Consideration (and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor pursuant to _Section 2.9(e)_) and (y) the Stock Consideration, in
each case, for each share of Common Stock underlying such Restricted Stock
Unit as set forth in _Section 2.7(b)_ hereto. Any accrued but unpaid dividend
equivalents corresponding to each such Restricted Stock Unit shall, by virtue
of the Initial Merger and without any action on the part of any party, become
fully vested and be paid in cash at the time the corresponding Restricted
Stock Unit is settled.

 



-14- (iv) As to each Performance Share Unit, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each such Performance Share Unit granted before December 1, 2015 shall
vest assuming achievement of maximum performance and each such Performance
Share Unit granted on or after December 1, 2015 shall vest assuming
achievement at target performance, in each case, as set forth in each
applicable award agreement, and such vested Performance Share Unit shall, by
virtue of the Initial Merger and without any action on the part of any party,
be canceled and converted into the right to receive (x) an amount in cash
equal to the Cash Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor pursuant to
_Section 2.9(e)_) and (y) the Stock Consideration, in each case for each
share of Common Stock underlying such vested Performance Share Unit as set
forth in _Section 2.7(b)_ hereto. Any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents
corresponding to each such Performance Share Unit shall, by virtue of the
Initial Merger and without any action on the part of any party, become fully
vested assuming achievement of maximum performance and be paid in cash at the
time the corresponding Performance Share Unit is settled.

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.7(d)_ to the contrary, any
amounts receivable pursuant to this  _Section 2.7(d)_ by a holder of an
Equity Award shall be reduced by the Applicable Withholding Amount, as
provided in _Section 2.9(j)_ hereof. In each case, the Applicable Withholding
Amount in respect of an Equity Award shall first be applied to reduce the
aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of such Equity Award and, to
the extent such Applicable Withholding Amount exceeds the aggregate Cash
Consideration payable in respect of an Equity Award, the excess of such
Applicable Withholding Amount over the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in
respect of such Equity Award shall be applied to reduce the Stock
Consideration payable in respect of such Equity Award (based on the Parent
Measurement Price).

 

(vi) Parent or the Surviving Company shall pay or issue, or cause to be paid
or issued, the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration described in this
_Section 2.7(d)_ within five (5) Business Days following the Initial Merger;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any payment or settlement in respect of a Restricted Stock Unit or
Performance Share Unit that immediately prior to the conversion described in
_Section 2.7(d)(iii)_ and _Section 2.7(d)(iv)_ constituted deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the
earliest practicable payment or settlement date for such Restricted Stock Unit
or Performance Share Unit that does not give rise to a violation of, or the
imposition of taxes or penalties under, Section 409A of the Code. The Company
and Parent shall cooperate to instruct, and provide other documentation
reasonably required by, Parents transfer agent with respect to the Stock
Consideration issuable in connection with the conversion of Equity Awards
as provided in this _Section 2.7(d)_.

2.8. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who
shall have not voted in favor of the Mergers or consented thereto in writing
and who shall have properly demanded and are entitled to appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders instead shall only be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Common
Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have waived, withdrawn, or
otherwise are not entitled to, the right to appraisal of such shares of Common
Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
canceled and converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the
Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the
Merger Consideration upon surrender in the manner provided in _Section 2.9_.
The Company shall (i) give Parent prompt notice of any notice or demand for
appraisal or payment for shares of Common Stock or any withdrawals of such
demands received by the Company, (ii) give Parent the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands and (iii) not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle any such demands.

 



-15- 2.9. _Exchange of Common Stock_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company of national recognition and reasonably
acceptable to the Company, or Parents transfer agent, to act as exchange
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder. At the Closing, at or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Section 2.9_, (i)
certificates or evidence of book-entry shares representing a number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the Maximum Share Number, or such lesser
number of shares of Parent Common Stock payable as the aggregate Stock
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ and (ii) cash representing
the sum of the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to _Section
2.7(b)_ _plus_ cash necessary to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.9(e)_ in respect of Common Stock (such shares of
Parent Common Stock together with such cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In
addition, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time
to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to  _Section 2.9(c)_, which cash shall be considered part of the
Exchange Fund.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, and in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of (x)
a Certificate whose shares of Common Stock were converted into the right to
receive the consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ (i) a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in
customary form and contain customary provisions) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.9(c)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant
to _Section 2.9(e)_ and (y) Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Common Stock
were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.7(b)_ instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_ and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(e)_. Each holder of
record of one or more Certificates, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
such Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, and each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares, upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent of such Book-Entry Shares (which shall be deemed
surrendered upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" in
customary form or such other evidence as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request), shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the amount of
Cash Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.7(b)_, (ii) certificates or evidence of book-entry shares representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_, (iii) any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to  _Section 2.9(c)_ and (iv) cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(e)_, and the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the transfer or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.9(b)_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_ and cash in lieu
of any fractional shares payable pursuant to  _Section 2.9(e)_. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.9(e)_, in each
case until the holder of such Certificate shall have surrendered
such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to escheat,

 



-16-  Tax or other applicable Law, following the surrender of any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole share of Parent Common Stock and the amount
of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.9(e)_ and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
share of Parent Common Stock.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration,
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_
and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section
2.9(e)_ paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject,
however, to the Surviving Companys obligation to pay any dividends or make
any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which
may have been declared or made by the Company on the shares of Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At
the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the
share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving
Company of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-
Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Company for transfer, it shall be
canceled against delivery of and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or Equity Awards, no
dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to such fractional
share interests and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder
of Common Stock or an Equity Award who otherwise would have been entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash
(without interest) equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (A) the
fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all
shares of Common Stock formerly represented by all Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares surrendered by such holder, with respect to such holders Common
Stock, or the portion of all of such holders Equity Awards convertible into
Merger Consideration hereunder, with respect to such holders Equity Awards)
would otherwise be entitled _by_ (B) the Parent Measurement Price.

(f)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and
Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.9(c)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant
to _Section 2.9(e)_ paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Merger Subs, the Company, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock, dividends or other distributions
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to such date on which any Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.9(c)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant
to _Section 2.9(e)_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_ and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(e)_ shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) After the Effective Time, any Common Stockholders or holder of Equity
Awards will be entitled to look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for
payment of their respective claims for the consideration set forth in this
_Article II_, without interest thereon, but will have no greater rights
against Parent or the Surviving Company than may be accorded to general
creditors thereof under applicable Law.

 



-17- (i) _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent will issue, or will cause to be issued, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the payments with respect to such
Certificate to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_;
_provided_ , that the Person to whom such payments are made shall, as a
condition precedent to the payment thereof, indemnify Parent and the
Surviving Company against any claim that may be made against Parent, a Merger
Sub or the Surviving Company with respect to the Certificate claimed to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Merger Subs and the Surviving
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and
withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

(k) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
_provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
acquisition or a combination of the foregoing. Subject to  _Section 2.9(f)_,
to the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make
prompt cash payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration as contemplated
hereby, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section
2.9(c)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section
2.9(e)_, in each case to holders of Common Stock, Parent or the Surviving
Company shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost
through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is at all applicable times maintained at a level sufficient to make such
cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to this
_Section 2.9_.

 

2.10. _Certain Adjustments_. If, during the Interim Period (and as permitted
by _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.3_), the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event
shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration and the consideration
payable to holders of Options and Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to 
_Section 2.7(d)_ shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change.

2.11. _Conversion of Shares in the Follow-On Merger_. At the effective time
of the Follow-On Merger, by virtue of the Follow-On Merger and without any
action on the part of any party, each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company as the surviving corporation in the Initial Merger
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Follow-
On Merger shall be converted into and become one limited liability company
interest of the Surviving Company, and each limited liability company
interest in Merger Sub Two issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Follow-On Merger shall remain outstanding as a limited
liability company interest of the Surviving Company.

 

2.12. _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Initial Merger and the
Follow-On Merger, taken together, will qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, and that this Agreement will constitute, and is adopted as, a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section 368 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder; _provided_ that this _Section 2.12_ will
apply only if (i) the value of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Initial
Merger equals 40% or more of the 

 



-18-  aggregate value of all the consideration provided in the Mergers in exchange
for Common Stock (including, without limitation, cash paid as Cash
Consideration, cash paid to dissenters and cash paid in lieu of fractional
shares). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to
change any of the consideration (including by altering the portion of the
Merger Consideration which is Stock Consideration and the portion which is
Cash Consideration) to be paid under this Agreement in order for the Initial
Merger and the Follow-On Merger, taken together, to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with, or furnished to,
the SEC after January 1, 2014 and prior to the date hereof (excluding any
disclosures set forth in any such Company SEC Document in any risk factor
section, any forward-looking disclosure in any section relating to forward-
looking statements or any other statements that are non-specific, predictive
or primarily cautionary in nature other than historical facts included
therein) or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (each section or subsection of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation or warranty specified therein and any
such other representations or warranties where its applicability to, relevance
as an exception to, or disclosure for purposes of, such other representation
or warranty is reasonably apparent on its face), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and the Merger Subs as follows:

 

3.1. _Due Incorporation; Capitalization; Indebtedness_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and, where such concept is applicable, in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, with all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its respective assets
and properties as they are now being owned, leased and operated and to carry
on its business as now conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and, where such concept
is applicable, is in good standing in all jurisdictions in which it is
required to be so qualified or in good standing, except where the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to Parent complete
copies of the Organizational Documents of the Company as amended through the
date hereof and made available to Parent complete copies of the Organizational
Documents of its Subsidiaries as amended through the date hereof, and none of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of such
Organizational Documents in any material respect.

(b) The entire authorized capital stock of the Company is one hundred and ten

" _Common Stock_ ") and ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ "). As of the close of
business on December 14, 2015 (the " _Reference Date_ "): (i) 36,853,226

granted on or after December 1, 2015, which assume applicable performance
criteria are satisfied at target levels), and (vi) 4,727,276 shares of Common
Stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to future awards under the Benefit
Plans. _Section 3.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ contains a
complete and correct list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each holder
of Equity Awards, specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis (i) the name of each
holder, (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each such award,
(iii) the grant date of each such award, (iv) the exercise price for each
Option and (v) the expiration date of each Option. Each Option has been
granted with a per share exercise price at least equal to the per share fair
market value, as reasonably and in good faith determined by the Board or a
committee thereof under Section 409A of the Code, of a share of Common Stock
on the applicable date of grant. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. No shares
of the Common Stock are subject to or were issued in violation of the
preemptive rights of any

 



-19-  stockholder or any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any agreement to
which the Company is a party or otherwise bound. Except as set forth in this
_Section 3.1_ and in _Section 3.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter_,
as of the date of this Agreement, there are no (i) issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of or other voting or equity interests in the Company,
(ii) securities of the Company convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for shares of capital stock of or other voting or equity interests in the
Company, (iii) options, warrants or other rights or agreements to acquire from
the Company, or other obligation of the Company to issue, deliver, transfer or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered, transferred or sold, any shares of
capital stock of or other voting or equity interests in the Company or
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock of or other voting or equity interests in the Company, (iv)
voting trusts, proxies or other similar agreements to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound with respect to the voting of any shares of capital
stock of or other voting or equity interests in the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (v) obligations requiring the registration for sale of any
shares of capital stock of or other voting or equity interests in the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (vi) outstanding or authorized appreciation
rights, rights of first offer, performance shares, "phantom" stock rights or
similar agreements or obligations (contingent or otherwise) pursuant to which
any Person is or may be entitled to receive any payment or other value from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries based on the revenues, earnings or
financial performance, or stock price performance or other attribute of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their businesses or assets
are calculated in accordance therewith (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) being referred to collectively as the " _Company Securities_ "). There
are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities (other than
in connection with the exercise, settlement or vesting of Equity Awards
outstanding as of the Reference Date in accordance with their terms). No
Subsidiary of the Company owns any shares of capital stock of the Company.
Since the Reference Date, through the date hereof, the Company has not issued
or repurchased any shares of its capital stock (other than in connection with
the exercise, settlement or vesting of Equity Awards outstanding as of the
Reference Date in accordance with their terms) or issued or granted any other
rights to purchase or receive capital stock or granted any Equity Awards.

 

(c) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of and other voting or
equity interests in each of the Companys Subsidiaries have been and are duly
authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned
beneficially and of record wholly by the Company or one of the Companys

reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.4. _Financial Statements; Company SEC Documents; No Undisclosed Liabilities;
Information Supplied_.

 

(a) There are no liabilities, debts, claims or obligations of any nature of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, whether known, unknown, accrued, absolute,
direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise, whether due or to become due ("
_Liabilities_ "), except (i) Liabilities disclosed in _Section 3.4(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter_, (ii) Liabilities to the extent reflected or
reserved against in the Latest Company Balance Sheet, (iii) Liabilities
incurred since the date of the Latest Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary

(b) Each report, schedule, form, statement and other document (including any
amendments or supplements thereto) required to be furnished or filed by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with the SEC since January 1, 2013 (such
documents, together with any documents filed with the SEC by the Company and
its Subsidiaries during such period, including any amendments or supplements
thereto, collectively referred to as the " _Company SEC Documents_ ") has been
timely filed or otherwise furnished by the Company to the SEC and (i) at the
time filed (and giving effect to any amendments or supplements thereto filed
prior to the date of this Agreement), and, in the case of registration
statements, at the time of effectiveness, complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document and (ii) did not at the
time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior
to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment),
and, in the case of registration statements, at the time of effectiveness,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is, or at any time since
January 1, 2012 has been, required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer
of the Company has failed in any respect to make the certifications required
of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of SOX. There are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in any comment letters of the staff of the SEC received by
the Company relating to the Company SEC Documents. None of the Company SEC
Documents is, to the Knowledge of the Company, the subject of ongoing SEC
review. Each of the consolidated financial statements (including all related
notes and schedules) included in the Company SEC Documents (A) complied at
the time it was filed as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, (B) was prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or Form 8-K of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods shown (except that the unaudited
statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments not material in nature or amount) and (C) have been prepared from,
and are in accordance with, the books and records of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries. The books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been and are being maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements. No independent public accountant of the Company or
its Subsidiaries has resigned (or informed the Company that it intends to
resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of the Company as
a result of or in connection with any disagreements with the Company on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain systems of
internal accounting controls with respect to their businesses designed to
ensure that (i) all transactions are executed in accordance with the general
or specific authorization of the management of the Company and (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP. The Company maintains

 



-22-  disclosure controls and procedures required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of
the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
ensuring that material information required to be disclosed by the Company is
recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure
documents. Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in all
material respects in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys
financial statements for external purposes, in each case, in accordance with
GAAP. The Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer have
disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board (A) any "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" in the
design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting,
and in each case the Company has made available to Parent (or its
Representatives) prior to the date of this Agreement all such disclosures from
January 1, 2013 to the date of this Agreement. The terms
"significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" have the meanings
assigned to such terms in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. To the Knowledge
of the Company, there is no reason to believe that the Companys outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of SOX, without
additional qualification, when next due.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract, agreement or arrangement (including any
contract, agreement or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
contract, agreement or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys financial statements or
other Company SEC Documents.

(e) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of the
Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time
it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or (ii) the Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the
Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or the Merger Subs
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act.

3.5. _Title to Assets, etc._ Except as disclosed in  _Section 3.5 of the
Company Disclosure Letter_ and except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or a valid leasehold interest in or
valid license to, each of its assets and properties reflected in the
consolidated financial statements included in the Company SEC Documents or
that are material to its business as conducted as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Assets_ "), in each case, free and clear of any Lien,
except for Permitted Liens, (ii) any Permitted Liens on the Assets,
individually or in the aggregate, do not materially interfere with the current
use of any such Asset by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or materially
detract from the value of any such Asset, and (iii) to the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no facts or conditions affecting any Assets that, with or
without notice or the lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to materially interfere with the use,
occupancy or operation of such Assets as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing.

_Section 3.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ or as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect: (A) neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any license to a third party or

January 1, 2013, no third party has asserted any such claim in writing or
otherwise against the Company or its Subsidiaries (1) challenging or seeking
to deny or restrict in any material respect the rights of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in the Owned Intellectual Property or (2) alleging that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated in any material respect any Intellectual Property of any third party.

that would reasonably be expected to result in the cancelation or
unenforceability of such Owned Intellectual Property.

 

(b) _Section 3.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ lists all agreements

Company and its Subsidiaries. The Owned Intellectual Property and the
intellectual property licensed by the Company and its Subsidiaries constitute
all of the material Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with past practice.

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries own all right, title
and interest in and to, or have the right to use, all other Intellectual
Property used in or necessary for the operation of their respective
businesses, in each case free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens ( _provided_ that the foregoing representation will not be read as a
representation of non-infringement, which is solely dealt with in _Section
3.6(a)(B)_).

 

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, no current or former employee, consultant or contractor has

hereby. Each of Parent and each Merger Sub has duly and validly executed and
delivered this Agreement. Assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery hereof by the Company, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of each of Parent and each Merger Sub, enforceable
against them in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws now or hereafter in effect which
affect the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by rules of Law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and equitable principles.

4.4. _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except for (a) filings under 
_Section 2.3_, and (b) filings under the HSR Act, (c) the applicable

registration by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with, or consent or
approval with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of, or other action

consent, action, Lien, right, violation, conflict, breach or default would not
be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.5. _Operations of the Merger Subs_. Each Merger Sub was formed specifically
for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has conducted no
operations and incurred no obligations other than those incident to its
formation and in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Merger Sub Two is, and at the effective time of the Follow-On
Merger will be, treated as a "disregarded entity" of Parent for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

 



-34- 4.6. _Financial Statements; Parent SEC Documents; Information Supplied_.

 

(a) There are no Liabilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries, except (i)
Liabilities disclosed in _Section 4.6(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter_,
(ii) Liabilities to the extent reflected or reserved against in the Latest
Parent Balance Sheet, (iii) Liabilities incurred since the date of the Latest
Parent Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice or (iv) Liabilities that would not be reasonably expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Each report, schedule, form, statement and other document (including any
amendments or supplements thereto) required to be furnished or filed by
Parent and its Subsidiaries with the SEC since June 1, 2013 (such documents,
together with any documents filed with the SEC by Parent and its Subsidiaries
during such period, including any amendments or supplements thereto,
collectively referred to as the " _Parent SEC Documents_ ") has been timely
filed or otherwise furnished by Parent to the SEC and (i) at the time filed
(and giving effect to any amendments or supplements thereto filed prior to
the date of this Agreement), and, in the case of registration statements, at
the time of effectiveness, complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as
the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Document and (ii) did not at the time
it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to
the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment),
and, in the case of registration statements, at the time of effectiveness,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of Parents Subsidiaries is, or at any time since June 1,
2012 has been, required to file any forms, reports or other documents with
the SEC. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Parent has
failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under
Section 302 or 906 of SOX. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
any comment letters of the staff of the SEC received by Parent relating to
the Parent SEC Documents. None of the Parent SEC Documents is, to the
Knowledge of the Company, the subject of ongoing SEC review. Each of the
consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules)
included in the Parent SEC Documents (A) complied at the time it was filed as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (B) was
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q or Form 8-K of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
periods shown (except that the unaudited statements may not contain footnotes
and are subject to normal year-end audit adjustments not material in nature or
amount) and (C) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books
and records of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries. The books and
records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been and are being maintained in
all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal
and accounting requirements. No independent public accountant of Parent or
its Subsidiaries has resigned (or informed Parent that it intends to resign)
or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Parent as a result of
or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

(c) Parent and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain systems of
internal accounting controls with respect to their businesses designed to
ensure that (i) all transactions are executed in accordance with the general
or specific authorization of the management of Parent, and (ii) transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP. Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information
required to be disclosed by Parent is recorded and reported on a timely basis
to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Parents filings with
the SEC and other public disclosure documents. Such internal control over
financial reporting is effective in all material respects in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of Parents financial statements for external
purposes, in each case, in accordance with GAAP. Parents chief executive
officer and chief financial officer have disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parents auditors and the
audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent (A) any "significant
deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" in the design or operation of its
internal

 



-35-  controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents internal
control over financial reporting, and in each case Parent has made available
to the Company (or its Representatives) prior to the date of this Agreement
all such disclosures from June 1, 2012 to the date of this Agreement. The
terms "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" have the meanings
assigned to such terms in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. To the
Knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parents outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of SOX, without
additional qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract, agreement or arrangement (including any
contract, agreement or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract,
agreement or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
Parents or such Subsidiarys financial statements or other Parent SEC
Documents.

(e) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
Parent or a Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the
SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii)
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders
of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or a
Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement. The Form S-4 will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

4.7. _Litigation_. Except as set forth on _Section 4.7 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter_ or as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, (a) none of Parent, its Subsidiaries or any of their
material assets is subject to any outstanding or unsatisfied Order, (b) there
is no Litigation of, before or in any, Governmental Authority, court or quasi-
judicial or administrative agency or official of any federal, state, local or
foreign jurisdiction, arbitrator or mediator, pending, or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened against or affecting any of Parent, its Subsidiaries or
their material assets, (c) there are no settlements or similar written
agreements with any Governmental Authority affecting any of Parent,
its Subsidiaries or their material assets and (d) as of the date hereof,
there is no Litigation involving Parent, its Subsidiaries or their material
assets, pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, which questions or
challenges (i) the validity of this Agreement, or (ii) any action taken or to
be taken by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

target of Sanctions or designated as a "Specially Designated National" or

the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been conducted only in the

there has not been any change, event, fact, effect, condition, development or
occurrence that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.10. _Financial Ability_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete
and correct copies of the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
hereof, from the Debt Financing Sources and the executed fee letter (with only
the amounts or fees, "pricing flex" and economic terms therein redacted (none
of which redacted terms will affect the amount or availability of the
financing contemplated thereby)) associated therewith (such commitment letter,
including all exhibits schedules, annexes, supplements, amendments and
joinders thereto and the fee letter, including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes, supplements, amendments and joinders thereto, collectively, the "
_Debt Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources
party thereto have committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein (including after giving
effect to any "flex" provisions in the fee letter (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Notes (as defined in such fee letter, the " _Debt
Financing_ ") for the purposes of financing the Mergers and related fees and
expenses. Parent will have at Closing, together with cash on hand at the
Company, all funds necessary to (a) pay the aggregate Cash Consideration
payable to holders of Common Stock and Equity Awards pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (b) repay, redeem, purchase,
defease or discharge on the Closing Date any indebtedness then-outstanding
under the Existing Credit Facility (up to the amounts outstanding as of

or discharge is required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (c) pay any fees and
expenses or other amounts payable by Parent in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the
date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments are in full force and

-37-  Knowledge of the Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of equitable
relief. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments have
not been amended or otherwise modified in any respect and to the Knowledge of
Parent, no amendment or modification of the Financing Commitments is
contemplated (other than customary joinder agreements with respect to
additional lenders). As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of
Parent, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of any of Parent or
the Merger Subs under the Debt Financing Commitments. As of the date of this
Agreement, the commitment contained in the Debt Financing Commitments has not
been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, to the

fees and amounts in connection with the Debt Financing Commitments that are

funding of the full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing, including
any condition or other contingency relating to the availability of the Debt
Financing pursuant to any "flex" provision, other than as set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement and
assuming satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by law) of the
conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Mergers,
Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Debt Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a timely basis or that the
Debt Financing will not be available to Parent at the Effective Time.

4.11.  _Brokers and Finders_. There is no investment banker, broker or finder

or any of Parents stockholders or Affiliates who might be entitled to any

taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

4.13. _No Additional Representations_. Except as otherwise expressly
set forth in this _Article IV_ , neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any other Person acting on their behalf, makes any representations or
warranties of any kind or nature, express or implied, in connection with the

warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates or budgets of
future revenues, future results of operations or future financial condition
(or any component thereof) of any of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

COVENANTS

5.1. _Access to Information and Facilities_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date this Agreement is terminated (the " _Interim Period_ "), subject to
_Section 5.1(c)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
give Parent and its Representatives and Financing Sources, upon reasonable
notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to the books and
records (including personnel records), real property, offices and facilities
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to make the officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries available to Parent and its Representatives and to furnish to
Parent all financial, operating and other data and information, in each case,
as Parent shall from time to time reasonably request, in each case to the
extent that such access and disclosure would not obligate the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to take any actions that would unreasonably interfere with
the normal course of their businesses or otherwise result in any significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by their employees of their
normal duties or violate any applicable Law ( _provided_ that the Company uses
its commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements
to provide such access and disclosure); _provided_ , _however_ , that this
_Section 5.1_ does not authorize any invasive or destructive environmental
testing or sampling of the Company Real Property.

 



-38- (b) During the Interim Period, subject to _Section 5.1(c)_, to the extent
reasonably necessary for the Company to confirm the accuracy of the
representations of Parent and the Merger Subs set forth in Article IV and the

_Section 7.2_, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, give the
Company and its Representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access
during normal business hours to reasonably accessible information and relevant
officers and employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(c) Nothing in _Section 5.1(a)_ or _Section 5.1(b)_ shall require the
Company or Parent to provide access or to disclose any information to the
other party or its representatives if such access or disclosure would be in
violation of applicable Laws or binding agreements entered into by the Company
or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, prior
to the date of this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to result in a
loss or impairment of the protection of any attorney-client or work product
privilege ( _provided_ that the Company or Parent, as the case may be, uses
its commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements to
provide such access or disclosure in a way that does not violate applicable
Laws or binding agreements or would not result in the loss or impairment of
such privilege). If any of the information or material furnished pursuant to
_Section 5.1(a)_ or _Section 5.1(b)_ includes material or information
subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other
applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened Litigation or
governmental investigations, each party hereto understands and agrees that the
parties hereto have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters
and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the parties hereto
that the sharing of such material or information is not intended to, and shall
not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or
information or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information
provided by the Company or Parent that is entitled to protection under
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges,
this Agreement and the joint defense doctrine. All such information provided
by the Company or Parent shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality

respects their businesses and the Assets, keep available the services of
directors, officers and employees and preserve intact their relationships with

reasonable best efforts to cause the attorneys, accountants, investment
bankers and other advisors or representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") of the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly induce or encourage or
otherwise knowingly facilitate (including by providing non-public information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries) any inquiries with respect to,
or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
engage, continue or otherwise participate in any negotiations or discussions
concerning, or provide access to its properties, books and records or any

with, relating to or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other

the Company shall not resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of any of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representatives of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this _Section
5.4(a)_. The Company shall, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and internal
Representatives to, and shall direct and use its best efforts to cause each of
its external Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any solicitations, discussions or negotiations or other activities with any
Person (other than Parent and the Merger Subs) in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that it will promptly request
each Person (other than Parent and the Merger Subs) that has prior to
the date hereof executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of an Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or destroy all
confidential information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any
of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof in accordance with the terms of
the applicable confidentiality agreement, and shall terminate access to data
rooms furnished in connection therewith. The Company shall promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing
of the receipt by the Company or its Representatives of any inquiries,
proposals or offers, any requests for information, or any requests for
discussions or negotiations with the Company or any of its Representatives,
in each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any offer, inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
which notice shall include a summary of the material terms and conditions of,
and the identity of the Person making, such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
proposal or offer, and copies of any such written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements, and thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a current basis (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours), of any material developments regarding any Acquisition Proposals
or any material change to the terms and status of any such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any existing
standstill or similar agreement to which it or one of its Subsidiaries is a
party, except that prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite
Vote, if after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of,
outside legal counsel, the Company Board determines that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive any such standstill
provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make, on a
confidential basis, to the Company Board, an Acquisition Proposal conditioned
upon such third party agreeing that the Company shall not be prohibited from
providing any information to Parent (including regarding any such Acquisition
Proposal) in accordance with and otherwise complying with this _Section 5.4_.
The Company shall promptly after the date of this Agreement terminate any
waiver that may have heretofore been granted to any Person other than Parent
or a Merger Sub under any confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
confidentiality agreement entered into with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or any offer, inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



-43- (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing contained
herein shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from:

(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer), in each case, to the extent legally required,
or from making any other disclosure to stockholders if, after consultation
with, and taking into account the advice of, outside legal counsel, the
Company Board determines that the failure to make such disclosure would be
reasonably likely to be a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law ( _provided_ that neither the Company nor the Company Board may recommend
any Acquisition Proposal unless expressly permitted by _Section 5.4(c)_, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such disclosure that has the substantive
effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Recommendation shall be
deemed to be a Change of Recommendation); _provided_ , _further_ , that the
issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen"
communication as contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to its stockholders) in which the Company
indicates that the Company Board has not changed the Recommendation shall not
constitute a Change of Recommendation;

(ii) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, (1)
providing access to its properties, books and records and providing
information or data or (2) engaging in negotiations or discussions, in each
case in response to a request therefor by a Person or group who has made a 
_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date hereof
and was not initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in, and did not
otherwise arise from a, violation of _Section 5.4_ or any other violation of
this Agreement, if the Company Board (A) shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably expected to constitute,
result in or lead to a Superior Proposal, (B) shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, outside
legal counsel, that the failure to provide such access or engage in such
negotiations or discussions would be reasonably likely to be a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (C) has received from the Person
so requesting such information or to engage in such discussions or
negotiations an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
that any such access, information or data has previously been provided to
Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with
the time such access, information or data is provided to such Person or
group; _provided_ , _further_ , that, without limiting the requirements set
forth in _Section 5.4(a)_, the Company shall promptly, and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours, notify Parent if the Company furnishes any
such access, information or data to Parent and/or enters into any discussions
or negotiations; and

(iii) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, making a
Change of Recommendation (but only if permitted by _Section 5.4(c)_).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, at any time prior to,
but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, in response to a _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date hereof and was
not initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in, and did not otherwise
arise from a, violation of _Section 5.4_ or any other violation of this
Agreement, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
(taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and the Merger Subs in response to
such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise) and, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, the failure to take the action in (i) or (ii) below would be
reasonably likely to be a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, the Company or the Company Board may (i) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal or (ii) (1) withdraw, modify,
qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or change the Recommendation, or
formally resolve to effect or publicly announce an intention to effect any of
the foregoing or (2) approve, endorse or recommend or propose publicly to
approve, endorse or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal (either, a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ");  _provided_ , however, that, if the Company terminates
the Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, the Company pays to Parent
the Company Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)(i)_ concurrently with or prior to such termination; _provided_ further
that the Company will not be entitled to enter into such definitive agreement
and to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or
effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to this paragraph unless (x) the
Company delivers to Parent a written notice (a " _Company Notice_ "), advising
Parent that the Company Board proposes to take such action and containing the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of
the proposed action by the Company Board (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal and copies of any written proposals or offers,
including proposed agreements) and (y) at or

 



-44-  after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company
Notice (such period from the time a Company Notice is provided until 11:59
p.m. New York City time on the fourth (4th) Business Day immediately following
the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice, the " _Notice
Period_ "), the Company Board reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor and taking into
account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed
in writing by Parent during the Notice Period) that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause
its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, engage in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material amendment to the terms and conditions of a
proposed agreement relating to a Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new
proposal or proposed agreement relating to a Superior Proposal for purposes of
this  _Section 5.4(c)_ requiring a new Company Notice and an additional
Notice Period, _provided_ that the applicable Notice Period shall end at 11:59
p.m., New York City time, on the second (2nd) Business Day immediately
following the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice (it being
understood and agreed that in no event shall any such additional Notice Period
be deemed to shorten the initial four (4) Business Day Notice Period).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to but not
after obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may effect a
Change of Recommendation referred to in clause (1) of such definition (other
than in response to the receipt or making of an Acquisition Proposal) if there
exists, with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries, any event,
development, change, effect or occurrence that was not known by the Company
Board or, if known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable, as of the date of this Agreement, and the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with, and taking into
account the advice of, outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company
Board to effect such a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to
be a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  _provided_ ,
that the Company will not be entitled to effect such a Change of
Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless (1) the Company delivers to
Parent a Company Notice advising Parent that the Company Board proposes to
take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor
and (2) at or after the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board reaffirms
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors and taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent during the Notice Period)
that, taking into account the advice of outside legal counsel, the failure to
effect such a Change of Recommendation pursuant to this sentence would be
reasonably likely to be a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause
its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, engage in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board shall not
make the determination referred to in clause (2) of the immediately preceding
sentence at the end of the Notice Period.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have
the meanings assigned below:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer (including
a tender offer) from any Person or group of Persons (other than Parent or a
Merger Sub) relating to (A) any merger, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, recapitalization, reorganization, spin off, share exchange,
business combination, purchase, joint venture or similar transaction with
respect to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, (B) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company) or businesses that constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or twenty percent (20%) or more of the total voting power of the
equity securities of the Company or (C) any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person or group of Persons
beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the total voting power of
the equity securities of the Company.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_  unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal (with all references to twenty percent (20%) in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal being treated as references to fifty
percent (50%) for these purposes) that the Company Board in good faith, after
consultation with the

 



-45-  Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines is more
favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company
than the Mergers taking into account all financial, legal, financing
(including availability thereof), regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal, including all conditions contained therein, and risks, likelihood
and timing of consummation of such proposal, such other matters that the
Company Board deems relevant and any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal pursuant to, and in
accordance with, _Section 5.4(c)_.

 

5.5. _Preparation of Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Stockholder s
Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) the
Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the proxy statement to
be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating to the Stockholders
Meeting and the prospectus relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Mergers (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") and (ii) Parent shall prepare (with the Companys
reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-4 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Form S-4_ "), in
which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with
the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in the Mergers. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and, prior to the
effective date of the Form S-4, Parent shall take all action
reasonably required (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction
in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of
process) to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection
with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Mergers. Each of
Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be reasonably
requested by the other in connection with any such action and the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement. As promptly
as practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become effective, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Proxy Statement will made by the Company, in each case without
providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The
parties shall notify each other promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the
qualification of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection
with the Mergers for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional information. Unless the Company
Board has made a Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section
5.4(c)_, the Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement.

(b) The Company, acting through the Company Board (or a committee thereof),
shall as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 has been declared
effective, take all action necessary, including under the DGCL, to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose
of approving and adopting this Agreement (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") and shall not postpone,
recess or adjourn such meeting; _provided_ that the Company may postpone,
recess or adjourn such meeting to the extent required by applicable Law or in
order to solicit additional votes as needed to obtain the Company Requisite
Vote; _provided_ that the Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed,
recessed or adjourned pursuant to the preceding proviso to a date that is
more than thirty (30) days after the date on which the Stockholders Meeting
was originally scheduled without the prior written consent of Parent. The
Company, acting through the Company Board (or a committee thereof), shall (a)
subject only to a Change of Recommendation made in accordance with _Section
5.4(c)_, include in the Proxy Statement the Recommendation, (b) include the
written opinion of the Company Financial Advisors, dated as of the date of
this Agreement, that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration is fair, from
a financial point of view, to the holders of the Common Stock

 



-46-  (other than Parent and its Affiliates) and (c) subject only to a Change of
Recommendation made in accordance with _Section 5.4(c)_, use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Vote, including to actively
solicit proxies necessary to obtain the Company Requisite Vote. The Company
shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if subsequent to the date of this Agreement the
Company Board makes a Change of Recommendation, the Company nevertheless shall
submit this Agreement to the holders of shares of Common Stock for approval
and adoption at the Stockholders Meeting unless and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms.

5.6.  _Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each party hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including using its
reasonable best efforts to obtain or make all necessary or appropriate filings
required under applicable Law and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

parties shall knowingly take, cause or permit to be taken or omit to take any
action which such party reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or
prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) (i) The Company and Parent will as soon as practicable but in any event
no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof file with the
United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice the notification and report forms required
for the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) subsequent to any filing
made hereunder, Parent and the Company will provide any supplemental
information that may be requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR
Act, which notification and report forms and supplemental information will
comply in all material respects with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of
Parent and the Company will promptly furnish to the other (x) all necessary
information as the other may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of any filing or submission pursuant to the HSR Act and (y) copies
of all substantive written communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance of any oral communication) with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent or Company can redact discussions of the transaction
value and reasonably designate applicable materials as for review by
the others outside counsel only. The parties shall also consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other
Competition Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree to
(i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings, substantive
telephone calls or discussions with any Governmental Authority in connection
with or relating to the HSR Act or any other Competition Laws, (ii) give each
other an opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, substantive
telephone calls or discussions, (iii) to the extent practicable, give each
other reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral communications
with any Governmental Authority in connection with or relating to HSR Act or
any other Competition Laws, (iv) if any Governmental Authority initiates a
substantive oral communication in connection with or relating to the HSR Act
or any other Competition Laws, promptly notify the other party of the
substance of such communication, (v) provide each other with a reasonable

other with copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental

additional information (a "second request", under the HSR Act received from a
Governmental Authority and to all other inquiries and requests received from
a Governmental Authority in connection with Competition Law matters, and (ii)
use their reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Competition Laws and to cause the
waiting periods, approvals or other requirements under the HSR Act and all
other Competition Laws to terminate or expire or be obtained prior to the
Termination Date.

 



-47- (d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with
the efforts referenced in _Sections 5.6(c)_ and _5.6(d)_ to obtain all
necessary consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of any Governmental
Authority required, or considered by Parent to be advisable to be obtained
pursuant to the HSR Act, each party to this Agreement shall: (i) cooperate
fully with the other parties hereto, shall execute and deliver such further
documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and shall take such other
actions as may be reasonably requested by any other party hereto to evidence
or reflect the Merger (including the execution and delivery of all documents,
certificates, agreements and instruments reasonably necessary for all filings
hereunder); (ii) use reasonable best efforts to give all notices (if any)
required to be made and given by such party to any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain each approval,
consent, ratification, permission, waiver or authorization required to be
obtained by such party in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) use reasonable best
efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in no event will Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
be required to (and in no event will the Company, and the Company will cause
its Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of Parent) (x)
commit, agree, or submit (or offer to commit, agree, or submit) to any consent
decree, hold separate order, sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer,
disposal, Lien, other change or restructuring of, or operating restriction
with respect to the businesses, properties, product lines, assets, permits,
operations, rights, or interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that would have, or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case measured on a scale relative
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (y) commit, agree, or
submit (or offer to commit, agree, or submit) to any action or agree to any
remedies, terms or conditions in connection with its obligations under this
_Section 5.6_ not conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers. If
requested by Parent, the Company (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, as
appropriate) will agree to any action contemplated by this _Section 5.6_,
_provided_ that any such agreement or action is conditioned on the
consummation of the Mergers. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Merger Subs agree to provide such assurances as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any Governmental Authority or other Person whose consent or approval is sought
hereunder. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this
section so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall bear the
cost of any filing fee payable to a Governmental Authority in connection with
any filings made under this _Section 5.6_.

5.7. _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) For the one (1) year period immediately following the Closing Date, Parent
shall provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to provide, each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing, to the extent that each
such employee remains employed with Parent or any of its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Company) as of and following the Closing (any such employee, a
" _Continuing Employee_ ") with: (i) at least the same annual base salary or
wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) at least
the same cash bonus or other short-term cash incentive opportunities
(excluding any equity-based incentive opportunities) provided to such
Continuing Employee by the Company in respect of the fiscal year in which the
Closing Date occurs, (iii) equity-based incentive compensation opportunities
that are substantially comparable to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent (other than with respect to sales employees), and (iv)
other employee benefits (including paid time off and perquisites) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those employee benefits provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date under the
Benefit Plans. Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, each Continuing
Employee (other than any Continuing Employee who is party to an individual
employment or severance agreement) whose employment is terminated by Parent or
its Subsidiaries during the one (1) year period immediately following the
Closing Date with severance benefits on the same terms and

 



-48-  conditions and at a level at least equal to the level of severance benefits
provided by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance
with the Companys severance policy, determined (1) without taking into
account any reduction after the Closing in compensation paid to such
Continuing Employee and (2) by taking into account each Continuing Employees
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities)
and, after the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries, and subject to such
Continuing Employees execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in
the form used by the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall require Parent to make any specific bonus
payment to a Continuing Employee, _provided_ that such Continuing Employees
bonus opportunity remained the same during the one (1) year period
immediately following the Closing Date to the extent required by this _Section
5.7_.

(b) Periods of employment with the Company or any of its current or former
Affiliates, to the extent recognized under any comparable Benefit Plan of the
Company and its Affiliates, including their predecessor entities (and if no
such comparable Benefit Plan exists, as such service would generally be
recognized by the Company prior to the Closing Date), shall be taken into
account for all purposes, including, as applicable, eligibility for
participation, vesting, level of benefits, and benefit accrual of any
Continuing Employee under the corresponding employee benefit plan offered by
Parent or an Affiliate of Parent to the Continuing Employees, including
vacation plans or arrangements, defined contribution, and any severance and
welfare plans;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its Affiliates shall
not be required to recognize such service (x) for purposes of benefit accrual
under defined benefit pension plans, (y) for purposes of plans that are frozen
to new participants, or (z) to the extent such credit would result in
duplication of benefits. Additionally, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health insurance coverage of
the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents due to pre-existing
conditions under all applicable health care plans of Parent or an Affiliate of
Parent to the extent such condition was satisfied or waived under the
comparable Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date and (ii) credit all
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents with all payments credited
against out-of-pocket maximums and deductible payments and co-payments paid by
such Person, in each case, under the comparable Benefit Plan prior to the
Closing Date during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs (or if
later, the plan year in which such Person becomes eligible to participate in a
plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent) for the purpose of determining the
extent to which any such Person has satisfied his or her deductible and
whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any health
insurance plans of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent for such year.

 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assume and honor all
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms. Parent hereby acknowledges that
a "change in control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Benefit
Plans will occur at the Effective Time.

 

(d) Parent and the Company each agree to the additional matters set forth in
_Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter_.

(e) Upon written notice from Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions that may be necessary or
appropriate to cause the Heartland Payment Systems 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan
and any other Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code that contains a Code Section
401(k) cash or deferred arrangement (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_") to
terminate effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing
Date, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time. All resolutions,
notices or other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with such
termination shall be subject to Parents prior reasonable review and comment.
In the event Parent provides the written notice described in this _Section
5.7(e)_, as of the Closing Date, Parent shall have in place a tax qualified
defined contribution retirement plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") in which
Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in any Company 401(k)
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date (whether or not actively
participating) shall be immediately eligible to participate (with the waiting
period for any Continuing Employee who is not actively participating in a
Company 401(k) Plan not to exceed the applicable waiting period under the
Company 401(k) Plans). The Parent 401(k) Plan shall permit each such
Continuing Employee with an account balance in any Company 401(k) Plan to make
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) to the Parent 401(k) Plan, in the
form of cash, common stock or loan promissory notes as applicable, in an
amount equal to all or any portion of the account balance distributed to such
Continuing Employee from any Company 401(k) Plan.

 



-49- (f) Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of,
or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan or (ii) prohibit Parent or
any of its Affiliates from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan
or from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee. The provisions
of this _Section 5.7_ are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to
this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 5.7_, express or implied, shall
confer upon any Continuing Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary
thereof or other Person, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right
of any employee or beneficiary of such employee or other Person under an
employee benefit plan that such employee or beneficiary or other Person would
not otherwise have under the terms of that employee benefit plan without
regard to this Agreement.

 

5.8. _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall agree on a joint
press release announcing the entering into of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Thereafter (and subject to any Change of
Recommendation to the extent permitted by _Section 5.4(c)_ in the case of the
Company), each party hereto will consult with the other party before
issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public statements or
disclosures with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the terms hereof, and each party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the other party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), issue any such press release or make any
such public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law or regulation
(including any NYSE requirement).

5.9. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Parent and the Merger Subs agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company or
any such Subsidiary or in any written agreement set forth on _Section
5.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Indemnity Agreements_ ")
shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms to the extent provided in the following sentence.
From and after the Effective Time for a period of six (6) years, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses (subject to the
Person to whom expenses are advanced providing an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Person is not entitled to indemnification) to, any individual who, on or
prior to the Effective Time, was an officer or director of the Company or any
of the Companys Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ ") with respect to all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law as required by (x) the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any such Subsidiary as in effect on
the date of this Agreement and (y) the Indemnity Agreements, and (ii) not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions referenced in
subsections (i)(x) and (y) above in any manner that would adversely affect the
indemnification rights thereunder of any Indemnitees. The Company has made
available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of the Indemnity
Agreements.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.9(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in
connection with any Litigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent such Litigation arises out of or pertains to the
fact that an Indemnitee is or was an officer or director of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or an officer, director or trustee of any other Person
at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the
Effective Time, in each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition
of any such Litigation the expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of
any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.

 



-50- (c) The Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case,
for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time with respect to any events occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Companys existing policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
maximum aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies for any such year
shall not be in excess of the maximum aggregate annual premium contemplated by
the immediately following sentence. If the Company or the Surviving Company
for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, there shall be no breach of this provision so long as (i) the
Surviving Company shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or
with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms
that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent will cause the
Surviving Company to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years
after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys
DandO Insurance as of the date hereof with comparable DandO Insurance that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier, on terms that are no less favorable than the
existing policy of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be required to pay an
annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of the annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its
last full fiscal year for such insurance.

 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this  _Section 5.9_. The provisions of this _Section 5.9_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 5.9_ shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which such a Person is entitled,
whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

5.10. _Financing_.

 

(a) To the extent that the Parent does not have cash currently, or at any time
prior to the Effective Time, available that is sufficient to enable it to
consummate the Mergers, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and procure and have available, as
of the Effective Time, funds sufficient to pay all of the cash amounts
required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the amounts payable in connection with the
consummation of the Mergers, all related fees and expenses required to be
paid as of the date of the consummation of the Mergers and the funds to be
provided by (or on behalf of) Parent to the Company to enable the refinancing
of the Existing Credit Facility. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and
the Merger Subs shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments, including using reasonable best efforts to satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions to funding in the Debt Financing Commitments. Parent and
the Merger Subs shall not (without the prior written consent of the Company)
consent or agree to any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision under, the Debt Financing Commitments, or enter into any
other agreement or arrangement with respect to alternative financing, if such
amendment, modification or waiver or other agreement or arrangement imposes
new or additional material conditions or otherwise materially expands any of
the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or otherwise would or
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the funding or
financing described therein or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, Parent and the Merger Subs shall be permitted to consent or agree to
any amendment or modification, or any waiver of any provision, under the Debt
Financing Commitments if such amendment, modification or waiver solely adds
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof as
parties thereto. Parent and the Merger Subs acknowledge 

 



-51-  and agree that the obtaining of the Debt Financing is not a condition to the
Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Debt Financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to keep the Company informed when so reasonably requested by the
Company and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange any
financing required in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any Debt Financing.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to
provide all cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent to assist
Parent and the Merger Subs in the arrangement of any third-party debt
financing (including the Debt Financing and, if the Debt Financing Sources
exercise the Notes Flex, any debt capital markets financing) for the purpose
of funding the payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration payable to holders
of Common Stock and Equity Awards pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the repayment, redemption, purchase, defeasance or
discharge of any outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money of any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the
payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith or pursuant to
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Financing_ "), including, without
limitation: (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnishing to Parent
and the Financing Sources the Required Information; (ii) upon request of
Parent, furnishing such other information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of such
Financing to the extent reasonably requested by Parent to assist in
preparation of customary confidential information memorandum, rating agency
presentations, road show presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda (including, to the extent
necessary, an additional bank information memorandum that does not include
material non-public information), prospectuses and similar documents to be
used for the completion of the Financing or otherwise in connection with the
marketing or placement of the Financing; (iii) cooperating with the marketing
efforts of Parent and the Financing Sources, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to participate, in each case at mutually agreeable times
and places and with reasonable advanced notice, in a reasonable number of
requested meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for,
and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing and the Companys
senior management and Representatives, presentations, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions, road shows and sessions with rating agencies in connection
with the Financing; (iv) if the Debt Financing Sources exercise the
Notes Flex, using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys and
any of its Subsidiaries independent accountants, as reasonably requested, to
provide reasonable assistance to Parent consistent with such accountants
customary practice (including to consent to the use of their audit reports on
the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in any materials relating to
the Financing or in connection with any filings made with the SEC or pursuant
to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and to participate in reasonable
and customary due diligence sessions); (v) if the Debt Financing Sources
exercise the Notes Flex, using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (I)
customary consents of independent accountants of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for use of their auditor opinions in customary materials relating
to the Financing and (II) drafts of customary "comfort" letters of
independent accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries (which shall
include customary "negative assurance" comfort) prior to the beginning of the
Marketing Period, which such accountants would be prepared to issue at the
time of pricing and at closing of any offering or private placement of the
Debt Financing (in the form of debt securities) pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act upon completion of customary procedures; and (vi) to the
extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are to be party to the
Financing following the occurrence of the Effective Time, (1) facilitating the
execution and delivery at the Closing of definitive documents (including loan
agreements, customary guarantee and collateral documentation (if applicable)
and other applicable loan documents and closing certificates) related to the
Financing, (2) to the extent requested by the Financing Sources at least 2
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing to the Financing Sources
at least 5 Business Days prior to the Closing Date all customary and
reasonable documentation and other information required by regulatory
authorities with respect to the Company under applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act
of 2001, as amended, (3) facilitating substantially concurrently with the
Closing all organizational actions by the Company and its Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in order to permit the consummation of such
Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to Parent,
its Subsidiaries and/or the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (4)
facilitating the pledging of collateral substantially concurrently with the
Closing (including using reasonable best efforts to facilitate the delivery to
Parent or its Financing Sources at Closing of original share
certificates, together

 



-52-  with share powers executed in blank, with respect to the Companys
Subsidiaries) and taking reasonable actions necessary to permit the Debt
Financing Sources to evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries assets for
the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements; _provided_ , however,
that nothing in this _Section 5.10_ shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would (A) unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the conduct thereof,
(B) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any fees, incur or
reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any payment in connection with the
Financing, prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time (except to the extent
Parent promptly reimburses (in the case of ordinary course out-of-pocket costs
and expenses) or provides the funding (in all other cases) to the Company or
such Subsidiary therefor), or incur any liability in connection with the
Financing that is effective prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time, (C)
require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
instrument, document, certificate, or agreement or agree to any change or
modification to any instrument or agreement at or prior to the Effective Time
or that would be effective if the Effective Time does not occur, (D) require
Persons who are directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time, in their capacity as such, to pass resolutions or consents
to approve or authorize the execution of the Financing, (E) provide access to
or disclose information that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
reasonably determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the effects of such
restriction or to provide a reasonable alternative to such access or (F)
prepare separate financial statements for any Subsidiary of the Company,
prepare any "guarantor /non-guarantor" footnote to any financial statements
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or change any fiscal period. Without
limiting the foregoing proviso, Parent agrees, promptly upon request, to
reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all of their out-of-pocket
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel) in connection with the Financing promptly following the incurrence
thereof (but excluding any costs, fees and expenses of preparing the Required
Information set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of the definition thereof, which
shall not be reimbursed). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and penalties of any type actually
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any action taken, or
cooperation provided, by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives at the request of Parent pursuant to this _Section
5.10_ and/or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith
(other than information provided in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries
specifically for use in connection therewith); in each case, except to the
extent that any such obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
awards, judgments and penalties, fees, costs or other liabilities are suffered
or incurred as a result of the Companys or its Representatives
gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or material breach of this
Agreement, as applicable, as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by
a court of competent jurisdiction. The Company hereby consents to the use of
its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing, _provided_
, that such logos are used solely in a customary manner that is not intended
to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and on such other customary terms and conditions as the Company
shall reasonably impose. Parent and the Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that
the obtaining of the Financing (including the Debt Financing), or any
alternative financing, is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirm their
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the
Financing (including the Debt Financing) or any alternative financing,
subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall be permitted, in connection with the
syndication of the Financing, to share all information subject to such
agreements with its potential financing sources and their Representatives,
subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by such potential financing
sources with respect thereto.

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver
all notices and take all other actions solely in the Companys control
required to facilitate the termination at the Closing of commitments in
respect of the Existing Credit Facility and, to the extent requested in
writing at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date by Parent,
any other indebtedness incurred by any of the Company and its Subsidiaries
after the date hereof pursuant to _Section 5.2(f)_ (it being understood that
the Company shall promptly and in any event no later than ten (10) days prior
to the Closing Date notify Parent whether it has entered into or intends prior
to the Closing Date to enter into any third-party debt facilities pursuant to
_Section 5.2(f)_ (other than any third-party debt facilities in effect as of
the date hereof)), the repayment in full of all obligations in respect of such
indebtedness, and the release of any Liens securing such indebtedness and
guarantees in connection therewith on the Closing Date (such terminations,
repayments and releases, the " _Existing Credit Facility Terminations_ "). In
furtherance

 



-53-  and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent on the Closing Date
payoff letters with respect to the Existing Credit Facility and, to the
extent requested by Parent, any indebtedness incurred by any of the Company
and its Subsidiaries after the date hereof pursuant to _Section 5.2(f)_
(each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance customary for
transactions of this type, from the applicable agent on behalf of the Persons
to whom such indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letters together with any
related release documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff
amount and provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in connection
therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries securing such indebtedness, shall, upon the payment of the amount
set forth in the applicable Payoff Letter at or prior to the Closing, be
released and terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.10(c), the obligations of the Company pursuant to this _Section
5.10(c)_ shall be subject to the following conditions and qualifications: (A)
Parent shall provide all funds required to effect all such repayments at or
prior to the Closing, (B) as of the Closing, with respect to each of the
letters of credit, bankers acceptances and similar instruments or facilities
of the Company or its Subsidiaries issued pursuant to the Existing Credit
Facility, Parent shall cause such letter of credit to be returned to the
issuers thereof or otherwise satisfy the issuers of such letters of credit as
to the disposition or retention of such letters of credit (including by cash
collateralizing such obligations on terms satisfactory to the applicable
issuers thereof, providing to the issuers of such letters of credit back-to-
back letters of credit, or otherwise providing other satisfactory arrangements
to the applicable issuers of such letters of credit, in each case, to the
extent applicable, on terms reasonably satisfactory to the applicable
issuer), and (C) in no event shall this _Section 5.10(c)_ require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (x) cause any Existing Credit Facility
Terminations to be effective until the Closing shall have occurred, (y) pay
any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any payment in
connection with the Existing Credit Facility Terminations, at or prior to the
occurrence of the Effective Time (except to the extent Parent promptly
reimburses (in the case of ordinary course out-of-pocket costs and expenses)

(i) this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii),_ (y) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_ or (z) by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ at a time when this

Company shall pay one hundred fifty three million dollars ($153,000,000) (the
" _Company Termination Fee_ ") to Parent (or its designee), at or prior to the
time of termination and as a condition to such termination in the case of a

the date of the Stockholders Meeting (in the case of _Section 8.1(f)_), prior
to the breach giving rise to such right of termination (in the case of
_Section 8.1(e)(i)_) or prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting (or if
the Stockholders Meeting is not held, prior to such termination) (in the case
of _Section 8.1(b)_), any Person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal, or an
Acquisition Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known and (B) within
twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether consummated), or an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been consummated involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether or not involving the same Acquisition Proposal as that
which was announced or otherwise became publicly known prior to such
termination), then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its
designee) the Company Termination Fee, such payment to be made within two (2)
Business Days from the earliest to occur of the foregoing events, payable by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and the Merger Subs acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a
Party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_,
and the other Party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
failing Party for the amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_ or a portion
thereof, the failing Party shall pay to the other Party all fees, costs and
expenses of enforcement (including attorneys fees as well as expenses
incurred in connection with any such action), together with interest on such
amount or such portion thereof at the prime lending rate as published in the
_Wall Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment is required to be
made. The amounts payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of
fraud or Willful Breach, shall be, together with any amounts payable pursuant
to this _Section 8.3(d)_, the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of
a termination of this Agreement where the Company Termination Fee is
payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ and the Company
Termination Fee is actually paid to Parent.

8.4. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable remedies
to prevent and restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in
any court specified in _Section 9.13_, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) any party has
an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

-62- 9.14. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES OF FACT AND LAW, AND THEREFORE, EACH SUCH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
OTHERWISE HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE NEGOTIATION, EXPLORATION, DUE

WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.14_.

9.15. _Disclosure Letters_. Disclosure in any section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall apply only to
the indicated Section of this Agreement, except to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to or relevant to another Section of this Agreement. The inclusion
of information in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to any of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. In addition, matters reflected in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited
to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters are
set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount
in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor
the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or
lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not
material, and shall not be construed as an admission of liability or
responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or controversy. Further,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are
or are not in the ordinary course of business (except where expressly stated
in the relevant representation, warranty or covenant), and shall not be
construed as an admission of liability or responsibility under any Law or in
any dispute or controversy.

9.16. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

9.17. _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise.

 

9.18. _Financing Source Arrangements_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that,
except as specifically set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments, all claims
or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against the Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt
Financing Commitments or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal

 



-63-  laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules
of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the Company and its
subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents, partners, managers, and members shall not have any rights or claims
against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Financing Commitments or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (ii) no Financing Source shall have any liability (whether in
contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company and its subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, or members for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto
under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing Commitments or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries of,
and shall be entitled to the protections of this provision to the same extent
as if the Financing Sources were parties to this Agreement. This _Section
9.18_ and _Sections 9.7_ , _9.10_ and _9.13_ may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, or any of its provisions waived, without the written consent of
the Financing Sources, which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole
discretion of the Financing Sources.
