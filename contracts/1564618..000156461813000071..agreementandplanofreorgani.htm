AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION ("Agreement") is made and entered
into as of the 21st day of November, 2013, by and between INDEPENDENT BANK
GROUP, INC., a Texas corporation and registered bank holding company with its
principal offices in McKinney, Texas ("IBG"), and BOH Holdings, Inc., a Texas
corporation and registered bank holding company with its principal offices in
Houston, Texas ("BOHI").

RECITALS:

WHEREAS, BOHI owns all of the capital stock of Bank of Houston, a Texas
banking association with its home office in Houston, Texas ("Bank of
Houston");

WHEREAS, IBG desires to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common
shares of BOHI (the "BOHI Shares") through the merger (the "Merger") of BOHI
with and into IBG, with IBG continuing as the corporation surviving the
Merger, pursuant to which holders of BOHI Shares will be entitled to receive
cash and common shares of IBG (the "IBG Shares") as provided for herein;

WHEREAS, IBG and BOHI believe that the Merger, as provided for and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and all exhibits,
schedules and supplements hereto, is in the best interests of IBG and BOHI and
their respective shareholders;

WHEREAS, after the Merger, IBG will effect the merger of Bank of Houston with
and into Independent Bank, McKinney, Texas, a Texas banking association and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of IBG ("Independent Bank"), with Independent Bank
continuing as the surviving bank (the "Bank Merger");

WHEREAS, the parties intend that: (i) the Merger will qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of § 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code") and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, (ii) that the Bank Merger qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of § 368(a) of the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and (iii) that this Agreement constitutes a plan of reorganization
within the meaning of § 368 of the Code and the applicable regulations;

WHEREAS, to induce IBG to enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of
BOHI have entered a voting agreement pursuant to which those shareholders
agree to vote their BOHI Shares and their ESPP Preferred Shares (as defined in
Section 3.03) in favor of the Agreement and the Merger;

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the parties
thereto entered into (i) the employment agreements with certain of the
executive officers of BOHI and BOH and (ii) the support agreements, in each
case, to be effective, if at all, at the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Additional Agreements");



WHEREAS, IBG and BOHI desire to set forth certain representations, warranties
and covenants made by each to the other as an inducement to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and certain additional agreements related to the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of IBG and BOHI have approved this
Agreement and the proposed transactions substantially on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

AGREEMENT:

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be bound
hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE I 
ACQUISITION OF BOHI BY IBG

Section 1.01. Merger of BOHI with and into IBG. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, BOHI will merge with and into IBG pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 10 and Chapter 21 of the Texas Business
Organizations Code (the "TBOC").

Section 1.02. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 10.008 of the TBOC. After the Merger, IBG shall continue as
the corporation resulting from the Merger (the "Resulting Corporation"), and
the separate corporate existence of BOHI shall cease. The name of the
Resulting Corporation shall be "Independent Bank Group, Inc." The existing
principal office and facilities of IBG immediately preceding the Merger shall
be the principal office and facilities of the Resulting Corporation after the
Merger. At the Effective Time, all rights, title and interests to all real
estate and other property owned by each of IBG and BOHI shall be allocated to
and vested in the Resulting Corporation without reversion or impairment,
without further act or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having
occurred, but subject to any existing liens or encumbrances thereon. At the
Effective Time, all liabilities and obligations of IBG and BOHI shall be
allocated to the Resulting Corporation, and the Resulting Corporation shall be
the primary obligor therefor, and no other party to the Merger shall be liable
therefor. At the Effective Time, a proceeding pending by or against either IBG
or BOHI may be continued as if the Merger did not occur, or the Resulting
Corporation may be substituted in the proceedings.

Section 1.03. Certificate of Formation and Bylaws. As a result of the Merger,
the Certificate of Formation, as amended, and Bylaws of IBG shall continue in
effect as the Certificate of Formation and Bylaws of the Resulting Corporation
until the same shall be amended and changed as provided by applicable law.

Section 1.04. Directors and Executive Officers. The directors and executive
officers of IBG as of the Effective Time, shall be the directors and executive
officers of the Resulting Corporation, and such directors and executive
officers shall hold office from the Effective Time until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided
in the Certificate of Formation and Bylaws of the Resulting Corporation or as
otherwise provided by applicable law.

Section 1.05. Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.10) by virtue of this Agreement and without any further action on
the part of any holder, all of the BOHI Shares outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time shall, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 8.07, be
converted into the right to receive an aggregate $34,000,000 in cash (the
"Aggregate Cash Consideration") and an aggregate 3,616,060 IBG Shares.

A. Any BOHI Shares that are owned by BOHI (other than as a fiduciary) shall
automatically be canceled and retired and all rights with respect thereto
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

B. Each BOHI Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time (excluding BOHI Shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.05(A)) shall be
converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange for, the right to receive:



(1) A cash amount equal to the quotient of (i) $34,000,000, divided by (ii)
the number of BOHI Shares outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
(the "Per Share Cash Consideration"), subject to adjustment pursuant to
Section 8.07;

(2) A fraction of an IBG Share, rounded to the nearest hundred thousandth,
equal to the quotient of (i) the quotient of (x) $136,000,000, divided by (y)
the number of BOHI Shares outstanding immediately before the Effective Time,
divided by (ii) $37.61(the "Per Share Stock Consideration"); and

(3) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, IBG will not
issue any certificates or scrip representing fractional IBG Shares otherwise
issuable pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional shares, IBG shall pay to each former holder of BOHI Shares
otherwise entitled to receive such fractional share an amount of cash
determined by multiplying (i) the Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction
of an IBG Share which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 1.05. "Average Closing Price" means the volume-
weighted average of the sale price per IBG Share on the NASDAQ Stock Market,
Inc. Global Market System ("NASDAQ") for the twenty consecutive trading days
ending on and including the third trading day preceding the Closing Date, as
reported by Bloomberg.

C. Subject only to dissenter's rights under Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the
TBOC, all BOHI Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be cancelled
and retired and all rights with respect thereto shall cease to exist, and each
holder of BOHI Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration provided for in this Section
1.05.

Section 1.06. Treatment of BOHI Awards.

A. BOHI Options. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated 2008 BOHI
Equity Incentive Plan and each underlying award agreement, each option to
acquire BOHI Shares ("BOHI Options"), that is not otherwise immediately
exercisable will become fully exercisable upon the approval of this Agreement
by the BOHI's shareholders at the BOHI Meeting (as defined in Section 1.09).
The BOHI Board shall set a date (which date will be at least one business day
before the Effective Time) (the "Specified Date") before which all BOHI
Options shall automatically be exercised without any action on the part of the
holder thereof on a for-cash or cashless exercise basis, as determined by such
holder, and BOHI shall issue BOHI Shares pursuant to such automatic exercise
of the BOHI Options. After the Specified Date and prior to the Effective Time,
all BOHI Options will terminate and the holder thereof shall have no further
rights to acquire BOHI Shares pursuant to any such terminated BOHI Option. All
BOHI Options and the number of BOHI Shares into which they will be
automatically converted are set forth on Confidential Schedule 1.06(A).

B. ESPP Preferred Shares. Pursuant to the terms of the BOHI Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP Plan"), the BOHI Board shall set a date (which date
will be at least two business days before the Effective Time) (the "ESPP
Specified Date") on which all accumulated payroll deductions by participants
in the ESPP Plan up to the ESPP Specified Date shall be applied to



purchase ESPP Preferred Shares. After the ESPP Specified Date and prior to the
Effective Time, no additional ESPP Preferred Shares shall be issued and the
participants in the ESPP Plan shall have no further rights to acquire ESPP
Preferred Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, all outstanding ESPP Preferred
Shares shall convert into BOHI Shares, on a one for one basis, pursuant to the
ESPP Plan and no shares of ESPP Preferred Shares shall be outstanding as of
the Effective Time. The ESPP Preferred Shares outstanding as of the date
hereof and the maximum number of ESPP Preferred Shares issuable between the
date hereof and the ESPP Specified Date, and, in each case, the number of BOHI
Shares into which such ESPP Preferred Shares will be converted, is set forth
on Confidential Schedule 1.06(B).

C. The BOHI Options and the grants of the option to purchase ESPP Preferred
Shares are collectively referred to as the "BOHI Awards".

Section 1.07. Treatment of IBG Shares. Each IBG Share outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, on and after the Effective Time, remain
issued and outstanding as one share of common stock of IBG as the corporation
surviving the Merger.

Section 1.08. Dissenting Shareholders. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, BOHI Shares that are held by shareholders of BOHI
who have complied with the terms and provisions of Subchapter H of Chapter 10
of the TBOC (each a "Dissenting Shareholder") shall be entitled to those
rights and remedies set forth in Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC; but
if a shareholder of BOHI fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any
such right or remedy granted by the Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC,
each BOHI Share held by such shareholder shall be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the consideration as specified in Section 1.05.

Section 1.09. SEC Filing and Shareholder Approval.

A. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, IBG shall
prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or other applicable form (the
"Registration Statement") to be filed by IBG with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") in connection with the issuance of the IBG Shares to the
BOHI Shareholders pursuant to Section 1.05 (including the Proxy Statement for
the shareholder meetings of IBG and BOHI and prospectus and other proxy
solicitation materials constituting a part thereof (together, the "Proxy
Statement") and all related documents). BOHI shall prepare and furnish to IBG
such information relating to BOHI and its directors, officers and shareholders
as may be reasonably required to comply with SEC rules and regulations in
connection with the Registration Statement. IBG shall provide BOHI, and its
legal, financial and accounting advisors, the right to review and provide
comments upon (i) the Registration Statement in advance of such Registration
Statement being filed with the SEC and (ii) on all amendments and supplements
to the Registration Statement and all responses to requests for additional
information and replies to comments relating to the Registration Statement
before filing or submission to the SEC. IBG shall consider in good faith all
comments from BOHI and its legal, financial and accounting advisors to the
Registration Statement, all amendments and supplements thereto and all
responses to requests for additional information. BOHI agrees to cooperate
with IBG and IBG's counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining
appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its financial advisor and
independent auditor and in taking such other actions in connection with



the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. If BOHI has cooperated and
promptly provided information required to be delivered by it for inclusion in
the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement as required by this Section
1.09(A) and Section 5.02, IBG shall file, or cause to be filed, the
Registration Statement with the SEC on or before January 6, 2014. IBG shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing
thereof. IBG also agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

B. The Board of Directors of BOHI (the "BOHI Board") shall duly call, give
notice of, and cause to be held, a meeting of its shareholders (the "BOHI
Meeting") and will direct that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby be submitted to a vote at the BOHI Meeting. Specifically,
the BOHI Board will present for the consideration of BOHI shareholders a
proposal to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The BOHI Board will (i) cause proper notice
of the BOHI Meeting to be given to the BOHI shareholders in compliance with
applicable law and regulations, (ii) distribute to the BOHI shareholders the
Proxy Statement, (iii) recommend by the affirmative vote of the BOHI Board a

necessary to ensure that shareholder approval of the proposals set forth in
this Section 1.09(B) are obtained. BOHI shall print and commence the mailing
(at its expense) of the Proxy Statement to its shareholders on or before the
fifth business day after the date that the Registration Statement is declared
effective and a final prospectus (relating to the Registration Statement) and
Proxy Statement is on file with the SEC before such mailing.

C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BOHI and the BOHI Board are permitted to
change its recommendation as contemplated by this Section 1.09(C) ("Change in
Recommendation") if and only to the extent that:

(1) BOHI, Bank of Houston and the BOHI Representatives (as defined in Section
5.10), have complied in all material respects with Section 5.10;

(2) the BOHI Board, after consultation with its outside counsel, has
determined in good faith that failure to make a Change in Recommendation would
reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; and

(3) if the BOHI Board intends to make a Change in Recommendation after BOHI
has received an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 9.04(C)), (a) the
BOHI Board has concluded in good faith, after giving effect to all of the
adjustments which may be offered by IBG pursuant to subclause (c) below, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined in
Section 9.04(D)), (b) BOHI shall notify IBG, at least five business days in
advance, of its intention to make a Change in Recommendation in response to
such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such
Acquisition Proposal) and furnish to IBG a written description of the material
terms of the Superior Proposal and copies of such other material documents
that BOHI is not required to keep confidential, and (c) before making such a
Change in Recommendation, BOHI shall,



and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the period after
BOHI's delivery of the notice referred to in subclause (b) above, negotiate
with IBG in good faith for a period of up to five business days (to the extent
IBG desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal.

D. The Board of Directors of IBG (the "IBG Board") shall duly call, give
notice of, and cause to be held, a meeting of its shareholders (the "IBG
Meeting") and will direct that this Agreement and the transactions

obtained. IBG shall print and commence the mailing (at its expense) of the
Proxy Statement to its shareholders on or before the fifth business day after
the date that the Registration Statement is declared effective and a final
prospectus (relating to the Registration Statement) and Proxy Statement is on
file with the SEC before such mailing.

and the Effective Time, the IBG Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a share dividend thereon
is declared with a record date within said period, the Per Share Stock
Consideration and any dependent items shall be adjusted accordingly to provide
to the BOHI shareholders the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action; but an offering or sale of IBG Shares shall
not be deemed a reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment of the IBG Shares.

(or any successor thereof) will take any action or fail to take any action
that would prevent the Merger or Bank Merger from satisfying the "continuity
of business enterprise" requirement for a "reorganization" as provided in
Treasury Regulations § 1.368-(d).



Section 1.14. Treatment of SBLF Preferred Shares. If IBG does not request that
BOHI redeem the SBLF Preferred Shares (as defined in Section 3.03) prior to
Closing, then concurrently with consummation of the Merger, each of the SBLF
Preferred Shares issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall be assumed
by IBG and exchanged for one share of preference securities of IBG with an
equal liquidation preference (the "IBG SBLF Preferred Stock"). Any such IBG
SBLF Preferred Stock shall entitle holders thereof to dividends from the date
of issuance of such IBG SBLF Preferred Stock on terms that are equivalent to
the terms of the SBLF Preferred Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to such exchange, taken as a whole. Any such exchange of the SBLF
Preferred Shares for shares of IBG SBLF Preferred Stock shall be in accordance

pursuant to which such shares of SBLF Preferred Shares were issued or required
to be entered into in order to effect such change.

Section 2.05. Exchange Procedures.

A.On the business day before the Closing Date, IBG shall deposit or cause to
be deposited in trust with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the "Exchange Agent") (i)
certificates for shares or evidence of shares in book entry form representing
the aggregate number of IBG Shares which the holders of BOHI Shares are
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.05, and (ii) an amount of cash equal
to the aggregate amount of cash which the holders of BOHI Shares are entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 1.05 (collectively, the "Aggregate Merger
Consideration").

B.As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, with the intent to be
within ten business days after the Effective Time, IBG shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of an outstanding certificate or
certificates representing BOHI Shares (the "Certificates"), a form letter of
transmittal which will specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and contain instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor. The form and
substance of the letter of transmittal and any associated cover letter shall
be mutually acceptable to IBG and BOHI before such transmittal materials are
mailed to the holders of the Certificates. Upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal properly
completed and duly executed (the "Transmittal Materials"), the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) an amount of
cash equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration, or the
Adjusted Per Share Cash Consideration (as defined in Section 8.07), if
applicable, multiplied by (y) the number of BOHI Shares represented by the
Certificate (the "Surrendered Shares"), (ii) a number of IBG Shares equal to
the product of (x) the Per Share Stock Consideration, multiplied by (y) the
number of Surrendered Shares, and (iii) an amount of cash as payment in lieu
of the issuance of fractional IBG Shares calculated in accordance with Section
1.05(B)(3), and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. The
consideration to be received by a shareholder of BOHI upon surrender of his
Certificate is referred to as the "Merger Consideration." Until surrendered in
accordance with this Section 2.05, each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes the right to
receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. Promptly after
receipt of the Transmittal Materials, IBG will cause the Exchange Agent to
review the Transmittal Materials in order to verify proper completion and
execution thereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time and the
surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with properly



completed and executed Transmittal Materials, IBG will cause the Exchange
Agent to promptly deliver the Merger Consideration.

C.After the Effective Time, the share transfer ledger of BOHI shall be closed
and there shall be no transfers on the share transfer books of BOHI of the
BOHI Shares which were outstanding immediately before such time of filing. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to IBG, they shall be
promptly presented to the Exchange Agent and exchanged as provided in this
Section 2.05.

D.Former shareholders of BOHI shall be entitled to vote after the Effective
Time at any meeting of IBG's shareholders the number of IBG Shares into which
their shares are converted, regardless of whether such shareholders of BOHI
have surrendered their Certificates in exchange therefor.

E.No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to IBG Shares and payable to the holders thereof shall be paid to the
holder of a Certificate until such holder surrenders such Certificate to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.05. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.05, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without
interest thereon, which had become payable after the Effective Time with
respect to the IBG Shares represented by such Certificate.

F.Any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (including the proceeds of
any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of BOHI
for six months after the Exchange Agent mails the letter of transmittal
pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be delivered to IBG upon demand, and any
shareholders of BOHI who have not theretofore complied with the exchange
procedures in this Section 2.05 shall look to IBG only, and not the Exchange
Agent, for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares.
If outstanding Certificates for BOHI Shares are not surrendered or the payment
for them is not claimed before the date on which such IBG Shares or cash would
otherwise escheat to any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items
shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property or any other applicable
law, become the property of IBG (and to the extent not in its possession shall
be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled to such property.

G.If any IBG Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
appropriately endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form (reasonably satisfactory to IBG) for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a certificate representing IBG Shares in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for
any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or not payable.

H.None of IBG, BOHI, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to
any former holder of BOHI Shares for any IBG Share (or dividends or
distributions with respect



thereto) or cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

I.If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by IBG or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as IBG or the Exchange Agent
may direct (not to exceed the amount of Merger Consideration relating to the
relevant missing Certificate) as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against IBG, Independent Bank, or BOHI with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

will (i) violate any provision of the charters, articles, certificates or

rights or obligations under, result in the creation of any lien upon any of

trust, or any material license, lease, agreement, contract or other instrument
or obligation to which BOHI or Bank of Houston is a party, or by which BOHI or
Bank of Houston or any of their respective Properties, assets or business
activities may be bound or subject.

Section 3.06. Compliance with Laws, Permits and Instruments. BOHI and Bank of
Houston, and their respective employees and agents, hold all material
licenses, registrations, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses as now being conducted. BOHI
and Bank of Houston are in compliance with all applicable laws, statutes,
orders, rules, regulations and policies of any Government Authority (as
defined in Section 11.10), except where the failure, whether individually or
in the aggregate, to be so in compliance is not reasonably expected to cause a
Material Adverse Change to BOHI or Bank of Houston.

Section 3.07. Financial Statements; Call Reports.

E. BOHI has made available to IBG copies of the audited financial statements
of BOHI as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011
(the "BOHI Financial Statements"). The BOHI Financial Statements (including,
in each case, any related notes), were prepared in accordance with GAAP or
regulatory accounting principles ("RAP") (except as may be indicated in the
notes to such financial statements) and fairly presented, in all material
respects, the financial position of BOHI at the dates and for the periods
indicated therein.

F. BOHI has made available to IBG true and complete copies of the Reports of
Condition and Income for Bank of Houston filed during 2013 and 2012 ("Bank of
Houston Call Reports"). Each of the Bank of Houston Call Reports fairly
presents, in all material respects, the financial position of Bank of Houston
and the results of its operations at the dates and for the periods indicated
therein in conformity, in all material respects, with the instructions for the
preparation of Bank of Houston Call Reports as promulgated by applicable
regulatory authorities. Without limitation of the foregoing, the allowance for
loan losses reflected in the balance sheets included in the Bank of Houston
Call Reports were calculated in accordance with GAAP and/or RAP; BOHI believes
that such allowance is, as of such date, adequate to absorb all reasonably
anticipated losses in the loan portfolio of Bank of Houston, and recourse
obligations in respect of loans sold by Bank of Houston in light of the size
characteristics of such portfolios, economic conditions, borrower capacity and
other pertinent factors, and no facts have subsequently come to the knowledge
of BOHI which would cause it to modify in any material way the amount of the
allowance for loan losses contained in the Bank of Houston Call Reports.

Section 3.08. Litigation. Neither BOHI nor Bank of Houston is a party to any,
and there are no pending or, to the Best Knowledge of BOHI, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against BOHI or Bank of Houston
which are reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
Material Adverse Change, nor, to the Best Knowledge of BOHI, is there any
reasonable basis for any proceeding, claim or action against BOHI or Bank of
Houston that is reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to result
in a Material Adverse Change. There is no injunction,



order, judgment or decree imposed upon BOHI or Bank of Houston or the assets
or Property of BOHI or Bank of Houston that has resulted in, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Material Adverse Change.

Section 3.09. Governmental Consents and Approvals. Except as set forth in
Confidential Schedule 3.09, no approval, consent, order or authorization of,

leasehold interest in, all of their respective tangible assets and Properties
including all material personal properties reflected in the BOHI Financial
Statements and the Bank of Houston Call Reports or acquired thereafter,
subject to no liens, mortgages, security interests, encumbrances or charges of

reflected in the BOHI Financial Statements or the Bank of Houston Call

funds deposits, and (G) those assets and Properties disposed of for fair value
in the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2013.

Houston has conducted its business only in the ordinary course and has not,

Section 3.29. Employee Benefit Plans.

A. Set forth on Confidential Schedule 3.29 is a complete and correct list of
all "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), all
specified fringe benefit plans as defined in Code § 6039D, and all other
bonus, incentive, compensation, deferred compensation, profit sharing, stock
option, stock appreciation right, stock bonus, stock purchase, employee stock
ownership, savings, severance, supplemental unemployment, layoff, salary
continuation, retirement, pension, health, life insurance, disability, group
insurance, vacation, holiday, sick leave, fringe benefit or welfare plan, or
any other similar plan, agreement, policy or understanding (whether written or
oral, qualified or nonqualified), and any trust, escrow or other agreement
related thereto, which (a) is currently maintained or contributed to by BOHI
or Bank of Houston, or with respect to which BOHI or Bank of Houston has any
liability, and (b) provides benefits to any officer, employee, service
provider, former officer or former employee of BOHI or Bank of Houston, or the
dependents of any thereof, regardless of whether funded or unfunded (herein
collectively the "Employee Plans" and each individually an "Employee Plan").

B. No Employee Plan is a defined benefit plan within the meaning of Section
3(35) of ERISA. BOHI has delivered or made available to IBG true, accurate and
complete copies of the documents comprising each Employee Plan and any related
trust agreements, annuity contracts, insurance policies or any other funding
instruments ("Funding Arrangements"), any contracts with independent
contractors (including actuaries and investment managers) that relate to any
Employee Plan, the Form 5500 filed with the IRS in each of the three (3) most
recent plan years with respect to each Employee Plan, and related schedules
and opinions, and such other documents, records or other materials related
thereto, as reasonably requested by IBG. There have been no prohibited
transactions (described under ERISA § 406 or Code § 4975(c)), breaches of
fiduciary duty or any other breaches or violations of any law applicable to
the Employee Plans and related Funding Arrangements that would reasonably be
expected to subject IBG, Independent Bank, BOHI or Bank of Houston to any
material taxes, penalties or other liabilities. Each Employee



Plan that is represented to be qualified under Code § 401(a) has a current
favorable determination or opinion letter. All reports, descriptions and
filings required by the Code, ERISA or any government agency with respect to
each Employee Plan have been timely and completely filed or distributed. Each
Employee Plan has been operated in material compliance with applicable law or
in accordance with its terms. There are no pending claims, lawsuits or actions
relating to any Employee Plan (other than ordinary course claims for benefits)
and, to the Best Knowledge of BOHI, none are threatened. No written or, to the
Best Knowledge of BOHI, oral representations have been made by BOHI or Bank of
Houston to any employee or former employee of BOHI or Bank of Houston
promising or guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for the continuation
of medical, dental, life or disability coverage for such person, their
dependent, or any beneficiary for any period of time beyond the end of the
current plan year or beyond termination of employment (except to the extent of
coverage required under Code § 4980B or applicable state law). Compliance with
FAS 106 will not create any material change to the BOHI Financial Statements
or the Bank of Houston Call Reports. There are no contracts or arrangements
providing for payments that will be nondeductible or subject to excise tax
under Code § § 4999 or 280G, nor will IBG or Independent Bank be required to
"gross up" or otherwise compensate any person because of the limits contained
in such Code sections. There are no material surrender charges, penalties, or
other costs or fees that would reasonably be expected to be imposed by any
person against BOHI, Bank of Houston, an Employee Plan, or any other person,
including an Employee Plan participant or beneficiary, as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect
to any insurance, annuity or investment contracts or other similar investment
held by any Employee Plan.

C. With respect to each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA)
maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to, currently or in
the past six (6) years, by any trade or business with which BOHI or Bank of
Houston is required by any of the rules contained in the Code or ERISA to be
treated as a single employer ("Controlled Group Plans"):

(i) All Controlled Group Plans which are "group health plans" (as defined in
the Code and ERISA) have been operated before the Closing such that failures
to operate such group health plans in compliance, in all material respects,
with Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title 1 of ERISA and Code § § 4980B and 4980D
would not reasonably be expected to subject BOHI or Bank of Houston to
material liability;

(ii) There is no Controlled Group Plan that is a defined benefit plan (as
defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA), nor has there been a Controlled Group Plan
that is a defined benefit plan in the last five (5) calendar years; and

(iii) There is no Controlled Group Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" or
"multi-employer plan" (as either such term is defined in ERISA), nor has there
been a Controlled Group Plan that is either a multiple employer plan or multi-
employer plan since 2007.

D. All Employee Plan documents, annual reports or returns, audited or audited
financial statements, actuarial valuations, summary annual reports, and
summary plan descriptions



issued with respect to the Employee Plans are correct, complete, and current
in all material respects, have been timely filed, and there have been no
material changes in the information set forth therein.

E. All contributions (including all employer contributions, employee salary
reduction contributions and all premiums or other payments (other than
claims)) that are due have been made with respect to each Employee Plan.

Section 3.30. No Excess Parachute Payments. No amount, whether in cash or
property or vesting of property, that will be received by or benefit provided
to, any officer, director or employee of BOHI, Bank of Houston or any of their
respective Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation § 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or
termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or benefit plan
currently in effect will be an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is
defined in Code § 280G(b)(1)) solely as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and no such person is entitled to receive any
additional payment from BOHI, Bank of Houston, or IBG if the excise tax of

any other person or entity for data processing, ATM or other technology
services.

unaudited interim statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly
presented, in all material respects, the financial position, consolidated
results of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows of IBG
and its Subsidiaries at the dates and for the periods indicated therein,
except that the IBG Interim Statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected to be
material in amount or effect. Without limitation of the foregoing, the
allowances for loan losses and reserves for representations and warranties
reflected in the consolidated balance sheets included in the IBG Interim
Statements were calculated in accordance with GAAP or RAP; IBG believes that
such allowances and reserves are, as of such date, adequate to absorb all
reasonably anticipated losses in the loan portfolio of Independent Bank, and
recourse obligations in respect of loans sold by



Independent Bank in light of the size characteristics of such portfolios,
economic conditions, borrower capacity and other pertinent factors, and no
facts have subsequently come to the knowledge of IBG which would cause it to
modify in any material way the amount of the allowance for loan losses or
reserve for representations and warranties contained in the IBG Interim
Statements.

C. IBG has not been notified by its independent public accounting firm that
such accounting firm is of the view that any of financial statements should be
restated which has not been restated in subsequent financial statements or
that IBG should modify its accounting in future periods.

D. Since December 31, 2012, none of IBG nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to
IBG's Best Knowledge any director, officer or employee of IBG or any of its
Subsidiaries or any auditor, accountant or representative of IBG or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of IBG or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that IBG or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No attorney representing IBG
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by IBG or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by IBG, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their officers, directors, employees or agents to IBG's
or any of its Subsidiaries' board of directors or any committee thereof or to
any director or officer of IBG or any of its Subsidiaries. Since December 31,
2012, there have been no internal investigations regarding accounting or
revenue recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction
of the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, individuals
performing similar functions, IBG's or any of its Subsidiaries' board of
directors or any committee thereof.

E. There are no outstanding loans made by IBG or any of its Subsidiaries to
any executive officer or director of IBG, other than loans that are subject to
and in compliance with Regulation O under the Federal Reserve Act.

Section 4.11. Taxes and Tax Returns.

V. IBG and its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed or caused to be filed
all material U.S. federal, state, foreign and local tax returns and reports
required to be filed by them on or before the date of this Agreement (all such
returns and reports being accurate and complete in all material respects) and
have duly paid or caused to be paid on their behalf all material taxes that
are due and payable by them on or before the date of this Agreement, other
than taxes that are being contested in good faith and are adequately reserved
against or provided for (in accordance with GAAP) on their respective
financial statements. As of the date hereof, IBG and its Subsidiaries have no
material liability for taxes in excess of the amount reserved or provided for
on their respective financial statements as of the date thereof.

W. There are no disputes pending with respect to, or claims (including
contractual claims) or assessments asserted in writing for, any material
amount of taxes upon IBG or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has IBG or any of its
Subsidiaries given or been requested in writing



to give any currently effective waivers extending the statutory period of
limitation applicable to any material tax return for any period.

X. Proper and accurate amounts, if required by law, have been withheld by IBG
and its Subsidiaries from their respective employees, independent contractors,
creditors, shareholders or other third parties for all periods in material
compliance with the tax withholding provisions of applicable law.

Y. The U.S. federal income tax returns of IBG and its Subsidiaries with
respect to all taxable periods beginning on or after December 31, 2009 have
not been audited or examined and no such audit is currently pending or, to the
Best Knowledge of IBG, threatened.

Z. Neither IBG nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into, or has any
obligation under, any tax sharing agreement, tax allocation agreement, tax
indemnity agreement, or similar contract or arrangement to indemnify any other
person with respect to taxes that will require any payment by IBG or any of
its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement.

AA. IBG has delivered or made available to BOHI correct and complete copies of
all material, U.S. federal income tax returns filed by IBG with the IRS,
examination reports and statements of deficiency assessed against or agreed to
by IBG and Independent Bank, if any, in each case with respect to any taxable
period beginning on or after December 31, 2009.

Section 4.12. Internal Controls. IBG has established and maintains internal
control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as
such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act);
such disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the reasonable
expectation that material information relating to IBG, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by IBG in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act since April 1, 2013, is accumulated
and communicated to IBG's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and
such disclosure controls and procedures are effective with the reasonable
expectation that information required to be disclosed by IBG in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
forms. Since April 1, 2013, the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of IBG have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC with respect to the IBG SEC Reports, and the statements
contained in such certifications are complete and correct. To the knowledge of
IBG, there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent IBG's chief
executive officer and chief financial officer from giving the certifications
and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification as to
a material weakness, when next due.

Section 4.13. Undisclosed Liabilities. IBG and Independent Bank have no
material liability or obligation, accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise
and whether due or to become due (including unfunded obligations under any
employee plan or liabilities for federal, state or local taxes or assessments)
that are not reflected in or disclosed in the IBG Financial Statements or the
Independent Bank Call Reports, except (A) those liabilities, obligations and
expenses incurred in



the ordinary course of business and materially consistent with past business
practices since September 30, 2013, (B) liabilities, obligations and expenses
incurred as a result of or arising from this Agreement or any other agreement
or document contemplated hereby, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or (C) liabilities, obligations and expenses as disclosed
on Confidential Schedule 4.13 or the other Confidential Schedules to this
Agreement.

Section 4.14. No Material Adverse Change. Except as disclosed in the
representations and warranties made in this ARTICLE IV and the Confidential
Schedules hereto, there has not been any Material Adverse Change with respect
to IBG or Independent Bank since September 30, 2013, nor to the knowledge of
IBG, has any event occurred that has resulted in, or has a reasonable
probability of resulting in the future in, a Material Adverse Change with
respect to IBG or Independent Bank.

Section 4.15. Financing. IBG has, or at the Closing will have, sufficient cash
on hand which is uncommitted as to any other use, or a credit facility with
sufficient availability, to pay the Aggregate Cash Consideration.

Section 4.16. Brokerage Fees and Commissions. Other than as set forth in
Confidential Schedule 4.16, IBG hereby represents to BOHI that no agent,
representative or broker has represented IBG or Independent Bank in connection
with the transactions described in this Agreement.

Section 4.17. Representations Not Misleading. No representation or warranty by
IBG contained in this Agreement contains or will contain on the Closing Date
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit on the Closing
Date to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained
herein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. To the Best Knowledge of IBG, all written statements, exhibits,
schedules, and other documents furnished to BOHI by IBG or Independent Bank as
part of the due diligence for this Agreement are accurate in all material
respects.

commitments, personnel and records of BOHI and Bank of Houston, and furnish to
IBG during such period all such information concerning BOHI and Bank of
Houston and their affairs as IBG may reasonably request, so that IBG may have
full opportunity to make such reasonable investigation as it shall desire to
make of the affairs of BOHI and Bank of Houston, including access sufficient
to verify the value of the assets and the liabilities of BOHI and Bank of
Houston and the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to IBG's obligations
described in ARTICLE VIII; provided, however, that IBG shall request
permission for all such access reasonably in advance and all such access shall

to its terms, IBG's designee will no longer be entitled to notice of and
permission to attend such meetings.

Section 5.07. Untrue Representations. BOHI shall promptly notify IBG in
writing if BOHI becomes aware of any fact or condition that makes untrue, or
shows to have been untrue, in any material respect, any material written
information provided by BOHI to IBG, any schedule to this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made by BOHI in ARTICLE III or that results in
BOHI's failure to comply with any covenant, condition or agreement contained
in this Agreement.

Section 5.08. Litigation and Claims. BOHI shall promptly notify IBG in writing
of any litigation, or of any claim, controversy or contingent liability that
is reasonably expected to become the subject of litigation, against BOHI or

potential litigation is reasonably likely, in the event of an unfavorable
outcome, to result in a Material Adverse Change to BOHI or Bank of Houston.
BOHI shall promptly notify IBG of any legal action, suit or proceeding or
judicial, administrative or governmental investigation, pending or, to the
Best Knowledge of BOHI, threatened against BOHI or Bank of Houston that (i)
questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this
Agreement or the agreements contemplated hereby, or any actions taken or to be
taken by BOHI or Bank of Houston pursuant hereto or (ii) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 5.09. Adverse Changes. BOHI shall promptly notify IBG in writing if

financial condition or operations of BOHI and/or Bank of Houston that has
resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Change to BOHI or Bank of Houston.

Section 5.10. No Negotiation with Others.

BB. BOHI agrees that it shall not, and that it shall cause Bank of Houston and
the respective employees, directors, officers, financial advisors and agents
of BOHI and Bank of Houston (collectively, "BOHI Representatives") not to (i)
solicit, knowingly encourage, initiate or participate in any negotiations or
discussions with any third party (except for the limited purpose of notifying
such person of the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.10) regarding
an Acquisition Proposal, whether by acquisition, business combination,
purchase of securities or assets or otherwise; (ii) disclose to any third
party any information concerning the business, Properties, books or records of
BOHI or Bank of Houston in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, other
than as provided herein or as compelled by law; or (iii) cooperate with any
third party to make any Acquisition Proposal, other than the sale by Bank of
Houston of assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices. Promptly upon receipt of any unsolicited offer, BOHI will
communicate to IBG the terms of any proposal or request for information and
the identity of the parties involved.

CC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.10,
if at any time after the date hereof and before the Closing, BOHI and the BOHI
Representatives,



having each theretofore complied with the terms of Section 5.10(A), receives a
bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, BOHI and the BOHI
Representatives may engage in negotiations and discussions with, and furnish
any information and other access (so long as all such information and access
has previously been made available to IBG or is made available to IBG before
or concurrently with the time such information or access is made available to
such person) to, any person making such Acquisition Proposal if, and only if,
the BOHI Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
and financial advisors, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably
capable of becoming a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure of the BOHI Board
to furnish such information or access or enter into such discussions or
negotiations would reasonably be expected to be a violation of its fiduciary
duties to the BOHI shareholders; but before furnishing any material nonpublic
information, BOHI shall have received from the person making such Acquisition
Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least as
restrictive in all material respects on such person as the Letter of Intent
entered into with IBG on October 22, 2013, which confidentiality agreement
shall not prohibit BOHI from complying with the terms of this Section 5.10.
BOHI will promptly, and in any event within two business days, (x) notify IBG
in writing of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information relating to BOHI or for access to the Properties, books
or records of BOHI by any person that has made, or to the Best Knowledge of
BOHI may be considering making, an Acquisition Proposal and (y) communicate
the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal to IBG, including as they may
change upon any modification or amendment to the terms thereof. BOHI will keep
IBG reasonably apprised of the status of and other matters relating to any
such Acquisition Proposal on a timely basis.

DD. Nothing contained in this Section 5.10 shall prevent BOHI or the BOHI
Board from (i) taking the actions provided in Sections 1.09(C) or 5.10(B),
(ii) responding to an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal for the sole
purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) informing any person who submits an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal of BOHI's obligations pursuant to Section 5.10(A) or (iv) in
consultation with outside counsel, complying with its disclosure obligations
under federal or state law in connection with a Change in Recommendation.

Section 5.11. Non-Governmental Consents and Approvals. BOHI shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals from
third parties listed on Confidential Schedule 3.05. BOHI will cooperate in all
commercially reasonable respects with IBG to obtain all such approvals and
consents required of IBG.

Section 5.12. Environmental Investigation; Right to Terminate Agreement.

H. IBG and its consultants, agents and representatives, at the sole cost and
expense of IBG, shall have the right to the same extent that BOHI has the
right, but not the obligation or responsibility, to inspect any Property,
including conducting asbestos surveys and sampling, environmental assessments
and investigation, and other environmental surveys and analyses including soil
and ground sampling ("Environmental Inspections"). IBG shall notify BOHI in
writing before any Environmental Inspection, and BOHI may place reasonable
restrictions on the time of such Environmental Inspection. If, as a result of
any such Environmental Inspection, further investigation ("Secondary
Investigation") including, test borings, soil, water and other sampling is
deemed desirable by IBG, IBG shall (i) notify BOHI in writing of any Property
for which it intends



to conduct such a Secondary Investigation and the reasons for the Secondary
Investigation, and (ii) at the sole cost and expense of IBG, commence the
Secondary Investigation. IBG shall give reasonable written notice to BOHI of
the Secondary Investigation, and BOHI may place reasonable time and place
restrictions on the Secondary Investigation.

I. IBG shall make available to BOHI the results and reports of such
Environmental Inspections and Secondary Investigations promptly after IBG
receives or is advised of such results. IBG shall not have any liability or
responsibility of any nature whatsoever for the results, conclusions or other
findings related to any Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or
other environmental survey. If this Agreement is terminated, except as
otherwise required by law, reports to any Governmental Authority of the
results of any Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other
environmental survey shall not be made by IBG. IBG shall make no such report
before Closing unless required to do so by applicable law, and in such case
will give BOHI reasonable written notice of IBG's intentions.

J. IBG shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if, with respect to
the Branch Locations (as defined in Section 11.10) only, (i) the factual
substance of any warranty or representation set forth in Section 3.22 is not
materially true and accurate; (ii) the results of an Environmental Inspection
or Secondary Investigation are disapproved by IBG because such Environmental
Inspection or Secondary Investigation identifies material violations or
potential material violations of Environmental Laws; (iii) BOHI has refused to
allow IBG to conduct an Environmental Inspection or Secondary Investigation in
a manner that IBG reasonably considers necessary; (iv) the Environmental
Inspection or Secondary Investigation identifies any past or present event,
condition or circumstance that would or potentially could reasonably be
expected to require a remedial or cleanup action costing in excess of $250,000
or result in a Material Adverse Change to BOHI or Bank of Houston; (v) the

cleanup; or (vi) the Environmental Inspection or Secondary Investigation

disapproves of the results of the Environmental Inspection or Secondary
Inspection in respect of the Branch Locations. Upon receipt of the
Environmental Notice, BOHI shall have the opportunity to correct any objected
to violations or conditions to IBG's reasonable satisfaction within 30 days
after the date of the Environmental Notice. If BOHI fails to demonstrate
correction of the violations or conditions to the reasonable satisfaction of
IBG, IBG may terminate the Agreement on the 31st day after the date of the

discuss such reports and information with IBG and shall be entitled to certify
the same in favor of IBG and its consultants, agents and representatives and
make all other data available to IBG and its consultants, agents and
representatives.

rights of the participants in such Employee Plans (including vesting rights).
BOHI and Bank of Houston shall terminate the employment and change in control
agreements listed in Schedule 5.13, make the payments required pursuant to
such agreements, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each

by such director or executive officer and dated the Closing Date, releasing
BOHI and Bank of Houston from claims arising before the Effective Time (the
"Releases by DandOs"). BOHI shall, and shall cause Bank of Houston to, deliver
to each of the directors and executive officers of BOHI and Bank of Houston a

writing by IBG, consistent with GAAP, RAP and applicable banking laws and
regulations, immediately before Closing, make such accounting entries as BOHI
may reasonably request in order to conform the accounting records of BOHI to
the accounting policies and practices of IBG. No such adjustment by BOHI or
Bank of Houston shall of itself constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation or



failure by BOHI or Bank of Houston to satisfy any representation, warranty,
covenant, condition or other provision of this Agreement or constitute grounds
for termination of this Agreement by IBG or be an acknowledgment by BOHI of
any adverse circumstances for purposes of determining whether the conditions
to IBG's obligations under this Agreement have been satisfied, nor will any
such adjustment affect the calculation of the Tangible Book Value under
Section 8.07. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to
imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or
information and shall not be construed as concurrence by BOHI, Bank of Houston
or their respective management with any such adjustments.

BOHI and Bank of Houston shall purchase an extended reporting period for three

Effective Time; provided, however, that the cost of such coverage for the full
three-year period shall not exceed 300% of the amount paid by BOHI in its last
full fiscal year for one year's coverage. In the event that the cost of such
coverage exceeds such amount, then the available amount shall be used to

provision of this Agreement, the premiums for such coverage shall be paid and
accrued for by BOHI and/or Bank of Houston and shall be included (as a
deduction) in the calculation of Tangible Book Value.

Consideration used in the calculation, and the amounts to be withheld for the
purpose of withholding and payroll taxes with respect to the BOHI Options.

Section 5.23. Termination of Data Processing. BOHI will use its reasonable
best efforts, including but not limited to notifying appropriate parties and
negotiating in good faith a reasonable settlement, to ensure that its DP
Contracts and contracts related to the provision of any other electronic
banking services, if the Merger occurs, be terminated after the consummation
of the Merger on a date to be mutually agreed upon by IBG and BOHI. Such
notice and actions by BOHI will be in accordance with the terms of such
contracts.



Section 5.24. Repurchase of SBLF Preferred Shares. Upon receipt of a written
request from IBG, BOHI, will as promptly as practicable upon receipt of such
request, redeem all outstanding SBLF Preferred Shares or give proper notice to

all steps necessary to cause all of the issued and outstanding SBLF Preferred

business days before the Closing Date, BOHI will have no SBLF Preferred Shares
issues or outstanding.

request. No investigation by BOHI or its representatives shall affect the

timely manner all reports with the SEC required to be filed by it pursuant to

omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without

this Agreement or consummation of the Merger) to the same extent (including
advancement of expenses) and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Articles of Incorporation or Association, as applicable, of BOHI and Bank of
Houston, and in the Bylaws of BOHI and Bank of Houston, as in effect on the
date hereof. If IBG or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with
or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of IBG or the surviving
company shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.15 prior to
or simultaneously with the consummation of such transaction.

Section 6.16. Election of Directors. IBG shall, and shall cause Independent
Bank, to take all action necessary to, effective as of the Closing Date, cause
their respective boards of directors to be increased by three and the persons
from the current board of directors of BOHI identified by the Corporate
Governance and Nominating Committee of IBG (the "BOHI Nominees") to be elected



to such boards of directors. IBG shall include the election of the BOHI
Nominees as a proposal to be considered and acted upon at the IBG Meeting,
specifically nominating one BOHI Nominee to be elected as a Class I director
whose term ends in 2014 (the "Class I BOHI Nominee"), one BOHI Nominee to be
elected as a Class II director whose term ends in 2015, and one BOHI Nominee
to be elected as a Class III director whose term ends in 2016. IBG shall
include the Class I BOHI Nominee in IBG's proxy statement and recommend that
the IBG shareholders elect the Class I BOHI Nominee to the board of directors
of IBG at the 2014 annual meeting of IBG shareholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, IBG's obligation to nominate and recommend, as the case may be, a
BOHI Nominee is subject to such BOHI Nominee's compliance with IBG's or
Independent Bank's, as the case may be, governance and ethics policies in
place from time to time, and that at least two of such BOHI Nominees qualify
as an "independent" director as defined by applicable NASDAQ rules.

Closing, IBG shall cause Independent Bank to establish and maintain for not
less than two years following the Closing Date a non-voting Houston market

herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension of
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party in the manner provided in Section 11.17, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. No party to this
Agreement shall by any act (except by a written instrument given pursuant to
Section 11.17) be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to
have acquiesced in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No
failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder by any party hereto shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. A waiver of any party of any right or remedy on any one occasion
shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that such party would
otherwise have on any future occasion or to any right or remedy that any other
party may have hereunder.

Section 11.17. Amendments. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors,
at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the BOHI
shareholders; but after the approval of this Agreement by the BOHI
shareholders, there shall not be, without the further approval of the BOHI
shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that decreases the consideration
to be paid for the BOHI Shares pursuant to Section 1.05 that materially and
