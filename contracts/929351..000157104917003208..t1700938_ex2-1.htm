respect to the making of such payment. Provided that the Sellers satisfy the requirements of Section 1.4(f), Purchaser currently
does not believe any withholding taxes are applicable. Before making any such deduction or withholding, Purchaser shall (i) provide
Sellers ten (10) days&rsquo; notice of Purchaser&rsquo;s intention to make such deduction and withholding and, in reasonable detail,

reasonable in efforts by Sellers to obtain such reduction of or relief from such deduction of withholding. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority and treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.</P>
