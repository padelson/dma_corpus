extent reasonable in efforts by Sellers to obtain such reduction of or relief
from such deduction of withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely remitted to the applicable

withholding was made.

commercial, regulatory or legal conditions.

any Governmental Authority. None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree
to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of
any filings, investigation (including any settlement of an investigation), or
other inquiry with respect to this Agreement unless it consults with the
other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting. Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives to, coordinate and cooperate fully
with the other parties hereto in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other parties hereto may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. The parties to this
Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and their
respective Representatives to, provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and

and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "40% Threshold"), or (ii) one or
more Epix Sales are entered into on or prior to the date (the "Eighteen Month
Date") that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date with respect
to an aggregate of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding ownership
interests of the Company or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole (the "50% Threshold", and together with the 40% Threshold, each an
"Applicable Threshold"), then within ten (10) Business Days following the date
(the "First Additional Payment Trigger Date") of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the definitive agreements for the Epix Sale that
first satisfied an Applicable Threshold (when aggregated together with any
prior Epix Sales) (each, a "First Additional Payment Sale"), Purchaser shall
calculate the First Additional Payment (as defined below), if any, as
set forth below, and if a First Additional Payment is due, shall deliver to
the Sellers a notice with such calculation and shall pay such First
Additional Payment in accordance with Section 4.7(g):

  



  

(i) First, with respect to each First Additional Payment Sale,
Purchaser shall calculate the product of:

  



  

(A) The difference of (1) the Enterprise Value for one hundred percent
(100%) of the Company implied by the consideration actually (or, in the case
of Company Closing Debt, deemed to be) received by Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates or the Company on or prior to the First Additional Payment Trigger
Date in connection with such Epix Sale (including, for clarity, any Escrowed
Amounts, Time-Based Deferred Payments, Equity Equivalent Exercise Amounts and
Contingent Payments actually received on or prior to the First
Additional Payment Trigger Date) _minus_ (2) the Threshold Price as of the
date of closing of such Epix Sale; _multiplied by_

  



  

(B) The percentage of the outstanding ownership interests of the
Company or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, sold
in such Epix Sale (as well as those acquired by the applicable purchaser upon
the exercise or conversion on or prior to the First Additional Payment
Trigger Date of any Equity Equivalents issued in connection with such Epix
Sale);

  



  

(ii) Next, Purchaser shall calculate the sum of the amounts determined
in accordance with the foregoing Section 4.7(a)(i) for all First Additional
Payment Sales (the "Aggregate First Additional Payment Proceeds");

  



    

 | -10-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Next, Purchaser shall calculate the product (the "Adjusted
Aggregate First Additional Payment Proceeds") of the Aggregate First
Additional Payment Proceeds _multiplied by_ the Aggregate Sellers Percentage;

  



  

(iv) Finally, if the Adjusted Aggregate First Additional Payment
Proceeds are:

  



  

(A) Greater than zero, then Purchaser shall pay to each Seller such
Seller's respective Pro Rata Portion of the Adjusted Aggregate
First Additional Payment Proceeds (the aggregate amount paid by Purchaser,
the "First Additional Payment"); or

  



  

(B) Less than or equal to zero, then no First Additional Payment shall
be made by Purchaser.

  



  

For clarity, this Section 4.7(a) shall operate only once, on the First
Additional Payment Trigger Date, and any subsequent calculations pursuant to
this Section 4.7 shall be carried out pursuant to Sections 4.7(b), (c), (d)
or (e), as applicable.

  



  

(b) _Six Month Additional Payment_. Solely in the event that
definitive agreements for one or more Epix Sales are entered into on or prior
to the Six Month Date (each, a "Six Month Epix Sale") that individually or
collectively satisfy the 40% Threshold, then within ten (10) Business Days
following the Six Month Date, Purchaser shall calculate the Six Month
Additional Payment (as defined below), if any, as set forth below, and if a
Six Month Additional Payment is due, shall deliver to the Sellers a notice
with such calculation and shall pay such Six Month Additional Payment in
accordance with Section 4.7(g):

  



  

(i) First, with respect to each Six Month Epix Sale, Purchaser shall
calculate the product of:

  



  

(A) The difference of (1) the Enterprise Value for one hundred percent
(100%) of the Company implied by the consideration actually (or, in the case
of Company Closing Debt, deemed to be) received by Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates or the Company on or prior to the Six Month Date in connection
with such Epix Sale (including, for clarity, any Escrowed Amounts, Time-Based
Deferred Payments, Equity Equivalent Exercise Amounts and Contingent Payments
actually received on or prior to the Six Month Date) _minus_ (2) the
Threshold Price as of the date of closing of such Epix Sale; _multiplied by_

  



  

(B) The percentage of the outstanding ownership interests of the
Company or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, sold
in such Epix Sale (as well as those acquired by the applicable purchaser upon
the exercise or conversion on or prior to the Six Month Date of any Equity
Equivalents issued in connection with such Epix Sale);

  



  

(ii) Next, Purchaser shall calculate the sum of the amounts determined
in accordance with the foregoing Section 4.7(b)(i) for all Six Month Epix
Sales (the "Aggregate Six Month Proceeds");

  



    

 | -11-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Next, Purchaser shall calculate the product (the "Adjusted
Aggregate Six Month Proceeds") of the Aggregate Six Month Proceeds
_multiplied by_ the Aggregate Sellers Percentage;

  



  

(iv) Finally, if the Adjusted Aggregate Six Month Proceeds are:

  



  

(A) Greater than the First Additional Payment (if any), then Purchaser
shall pay to each Seller such Seller's respective Pro Rata Portion of the
difference of the Adjusted Aggregate Six Month Proceeds _minus_ the First
Additional Payment (the aggregate amount paid by Purchaser, the "Six Month
Additional Payment"); or

  



  

(B) Less than or equal to the First Additional Payment, then no Six
Month Additional Payment shall be made by Purchaser.

  



  

(c) _Twelve Month Additional Payment_. Solely in the event that
either (x) definitive agreements for one or more Six Month Epix Sales
are entered into that individually or collectively satisfy the 40% Threshold,
and/or (y) definitive agreements for one or more Epix Sales are entered into
on or prior to the date (the "Twelve Month Date") that is twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date (including, for clarity, all Six Month Epix Sales)
that individually or collectively satisfy the 50% Threshold, then within ten
(10) Business Days following the Twelve Month Date, Purchaser shall calculate
the Twelve Month Additional Payment (as defined below), if any, as set forth
below, and if a Twelve Month Additional Payment is due, shall deliver to the
Sellers a notice with such calculation and shall pay such Twelve Month
Additional Payment in accordance with Section 4.7(g):

  



  

(i)  First, with respect to (I) _each_ Six Month Epix Sale, and (II)
solely in the event that the 50% Threshold was satisfied, _each_ Epix Sale
entered into following the Six Month Date and on or before the Twelve Month
Date, Purchaser shall calculate the product of:

  



  

(A) The difference of (1) the Enterprise Value for one hundred percent
(100%) of the Company implied by the consideration actually (or, in the case
of Company Closing Debt, deemed to be) received by Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates or the Company on or prior to the Twelve Month Date in connection
with such Epix Sale (including, for clarity, any Escrowed Amounts, Time-Based
Deferred Payments, Equity Equivalent Exercise Amounts and Contingent Payments
actually received on or prior to the Twelve Month Date) _minus_ (2) the
Threshold Price as of the date of closing of such Epix Sale; _multiplied by_

  



  

(B) The percentage of the outstanding ownership interests of the
Company or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, sold
in such Epix Sale (as well as those acquired by the applicable purchaser upon
the exercise or conversion on or prior to the Twelve Month Date of any Equity
Equivalents issued in connection with such Epix Sale );

  



  

(ii) Next, Purchaser shall calculate the sum of the amounts
determined in accordance with the foregoing Section 4.7(c)(i) for all
Epix Sales described in Section 4.7(c)(i) (the "Aggregate Twelve Month
Proceeds");

  



    

 | -12-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Next, Purchaser shall calculate the product (the "Adjusted
Aggregate Twelve Month Proceeds") of the Aggregate Twelve Month Proceeds
_multiplied by_ the Aggregate Sellers Percentage;

  



  

(iv) Finally, if the Adjusted Aggregate Twelve Month Proceeds are:

  



  

(A) Greater than the Aggregate Prior Payments (if any), Purchaser
shall pay to each Seller such Seller's respective Pro Rata Portion of the
difference of the Adjusted Aggregate Twelve Month Proceeds _minus_ the
Aggregate Prior Payments (the aggregate amount paid by Purchaser, the "Twelve
Month Additional Payment"); or

  



  

(B) Less than or equal to the Aggregate Prior Payments, no payment
shall be made by Purchaser.

  



  

(d) _Eighteen Month Additional Payment_. Solely in the event that
either (x) definitive agreements for one or more Six Month Epix Sales
are entered into that individually or collectively satisfy the 40% Threshold,
and/or (y) definitive agreements for one or more Epix Sales are entered into
on or prior to the date (the "Eighteen Month Date") that is eighteen (18)
months following the Closing Date that individually or collectively satisfy
the 50% Threshold, then within ten (10) Business Days following the Eighteen
Month Date, Purchaser shall calculate the Eighteen Month Additional Payment
(as defined below), if any, as set forth below, and if an Eighteen Month
Additional Payment is due, shall deliver to the Sellers a notice with such
calculation and shall pay such Eighteen Month Additional Payment in
accordance with Section 4.7(g):

  



  

(i) First, with respect to (I) _each_ Six Month Epix Sale, and (II)
solely in the event that the 50% Threshold was satisfied, each Epix Sale
entered into following the Six Month Date and on or before the Eighteen Month
Date, Purchaser shall calculate the product of:

  



  

(A) The difference of (1) the Enterprise Value for one hundred percent
(100%) of the Company implied by the consideration actually (or, in the case
of Company Closing Debt, deemed to be) received by Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates or the Company on or prior to the Eighteen Month Date in
connection with such Epix Sale (including, for clarity, any Escrowed Amounts,
Time-Based Deferred Payments, Equity Equivalent Exercise Amounts and
Contingent Payments actually received on or prior to the Eighteen Month Date)
_minus_  (2) the Threshold Price as of the date of closing of such Epix Sale;
_multiplied by_

  



  

(B) The percentage of the outstanding ownership interests of the
Company or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, sold
in such Epix Sale (as well as those acquired by the applicable purchaser upon
the exercise or conversion on or prior to the Eighteen Month Date of any
Equity Equivalents issued in connection with such Epix Sale );

  



  

(ii) Next, Purchaser shall calculate the sum of the amounts
determined in accordance with the foregoing Sections 4.7(d)(i) for all Epix
Sales described in Section 4.7(d)(i) (the "Aggregate Eighteen Month
Proceeds");

  



    

 | -13-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Next, Purchaser shall calculate the product (the "Adjusted
Aggregate Eighteen Month Proceeds") of the Aggregate Eighteen Month Proceeds
_multiplied by_ the Aggregate Sellers Percentage;

  



  

(iv) Finally, if the Adjusted Aggregate Eighteen Month Proceeds are:

  



  

(A) Greater than the Aggregate Prior Payments, Purchaser shall pay to
each Seller such Seller's respective Pro Rata Portion of the difference of
the Adjusted Aggregate Eighteen Month Proceeds _minus_ the Aggregate Prior
Payments (the "Eighteen Month Additional Payment"); or

  



  

(B) Less than or equal to the Aggregate Prior Payments, no payment
shall be made by Purchaser.

  



  

(e) _Equity Equivalents; Escrowed Amounts; Time-Based Deferred
Payments; Contingent Payments_.

  



  

(i) _Equity Equivalents_. With respect to any Epix Sales the
definitive agreements for which were entered into on or prior to the
Eighteen Month Date and which provide for the sale, transfer, assignment or
other grant to the applicable purchaser of any Equity Equivalents:

  



  

(A) Such Equity Equivalents shall initially be ignored for purposes of
determining whether the Applicable Thresholds have been satisfied;

  



  

(B) Upon exercise or conversion of any such Equity Equivalents on or
prior to the date that is the later of the Eighteen Month Date and the date
that is six (6) months following the closing of the applicable Epix Sale (the
"Equity Equivalent Exercise Date"), the outstanding ownership interests of
the Company or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
thereby acquired by the applicable purchaser shall be treated as if included
in the outstanding ownership interests of the Company or assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, contemplated as of the entry
into of the definitive agreements for such Epix Sale to be acquired by such
purchaser on the closing of the applicable Epix Sale, for purposes of
determining whether the Applicable Thresholds have been satisfied; and

  



  

(C) Any exercise or conversion of any such Equity Equivalents
following the Equity Equivalent Exercise Date shall be ignored for
purposes of determining whether the Applicable Thresholds have been
satisfied.

  



  

For clarity, this Section 4.7(e)(i) addresses only timing matters relating to
Equity Equivalents for purposes of determining whether the Applicable
Thresholds have been satisfied. As described in Sections 4.7(a), (b), (c),
(d) and (e)(ii), Equity Equivalent Exercise Amounts (and the ownership
interests or assets acquired by the applicable purchaser upon exercise or
conversion of the related Equity Equivalents) are included in the
calculations set forth therein when such amounts are received.

  



    

 | -14-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) _Post-Eighteen Month Additional Payments_. Solely in the event
that either Applicable Threshold was satisfied on or prior to the Eighteen
Month Date (or deemed to be satisfied giving effect to Section 4.7(e)(i)(B)
above), each time that:

  



  

(A) Escrowed Amounts or Time-Based Deferred Payments are received at
any time following the Eighteen Month Date by Purchaser or its Affiliates or
the Company with respect to any Applicable Epix Sale; or

  



  

(B) The initial purchase price is received at any time following the
Eighteen Month Date by Purchaser or its Affiliates or the Company with
respect to the consummation of any Straddle Epix Sale (a "Straddle Payment");
or

  



  

(C) Amounts are received by Purchaser or its Affiliates or the Company
in connection with the exercise or conversion of any Equity
Equivalents following the Eighteen Month Date and on or prior to the
applicable Equity Equivalent Exercise Date ("Equity Equivalent Exercise
Amounts");

  



  

then in each such case, within ten (10) Business Days thereafter, Purchaser
shall re-run the calculation described in Sections 4.7(d)(i)-(iii)
above, taking into account (x) all such Escrowed Amounts, Time-Based Deferred
Payments and Straddle Payments received at or prior to such time, (y) all
Equity Equivalent Exercise Amounts received at or prior to such time
(excluding any amounts received after any applicable Equity Equivalent
Exercise Date) and (z) all ownership interests or assets acquired by the
applicable purchaser upon the exercise or conversion of any Equity
Equivalents at or prior to such time (excluding any such ownership interests
or assets acquired by the applicable purchaser after any applicable Equity
Equivalent Exercise Date) (the resulting amount of each such calculation, the
"Adjusted Aggregate Post-Eighteen Month Proceeds"). With respect to each
calculation of Adjusted Aggregate Post-Eighteen Month Proceeds, Purchaser
shall, in accordance with Section 4.7(g), pay to each Seller such
Seller's respective Pro Rata Portion of the difference of such Adjusted
Aggregate Post-Eighteen Month Proceeds _minus_ the Aggregate Prior Payments
(each, a "Post-Eighteen Month Additional Payment"), and shall deliver to the
Sellers a notice with such calculation.

  



  

(iii) _Contingent Payments_. For clarity, Contingent Payments shall
only be included in Enterprise Value to the extent received on or prior
to the Eighteen Month Date, and any such Contingent Payments received
following the Eighteen Month Date shall be ignored for all
purposes hereunder.

  



  

(f) _Additional Terms_. For the avoidance of doubt:

  



  

(i) To the extent the payments received by Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates or the Company in connection with an Epix Sale imply an Enterprise
Value for 100% of the Company that is less than the applicable Threshold Price
as of the date of closing of such Epix Sale, the amount determined in
accordance with Sections 4.7(a)(i), (b)(i), (c)(i) or (d)(i), as
applicable, with respect to such Epix Sale shall be negative and shall be
aggregated together with any positive amounts for purposes of
the calculations under this Section 4.7. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Seller shall be obligated to repay the Purchaser for any amounts calculated
under this Section 4.7.

  



    

 | -15-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) The Sellers shall not be entitled to any payments pursuant to
this Section 4.7 as a result of a direct or indirect change of control of MGM
Holdings Inc., whether by the sale, liquidation, merger or other business
combination transaction, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
MGM Holdings Inc., in each case, whether or not in one or more of a series of
related or unrelated transactions, except only to the extent that
substantially all of the assets of MGM Holdings Inc. shall consist of
the equity or assets of the Company.

  



  

(g) _Purchaser 's Calculation; Sellers' Review; Payment_.

  



  

(i) In connection with each payment to be made pursuant to Sections
4.7(a)-(e) above, Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days following the First Additional Payment Trigger Date, the Six
Month Date, the Twelve Month Date or the Eighteen Month Date, as applicable)
deliver to each Seller a written notice (each, an "Epix Sale
Calculation"), which notice shall set forth (A) with respect to each Epix
Sale included in such calculation, the total consideration, the percentage of
the ownership interests in the Company, or of the assets of the Company, as
applicable, represented by the securities or assets to be sold, the existence
and status of any Escrowed Amounts, Time-Based Deferred Payments, Equity
Equivalents and Contingent Payments, and the Enterprise Value implied by such
Epix Sale as of the date of such Epix Sale Calculation, and (B) the
calculations described in Section 4.7(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) (as
applicable).

  



  

(ii) Upon receipt of an Epix Sale Calculation, the Sellers (acting
collectively as a single party for purposes of this Section 4.7(g)(ii)) shall
have ten (10) Business Days to deliver to Purchaser a statement of objection
("Objection Notice"), which shall set forth Sellers' objections to the Epix
Sale Calculation, which objections shall relate only to amounts included in
such Epix Sale Calculation that were not included in any prior Epix Sale
Calculations. If the Sellers do not deliver an Objection Notice within such
ten (10) Business Day period, Purchaser's calculation shall become final and
binding. If the Sellers deliver an Objection Notice and Purchaser and the
Sellers are unable to resolve all such objections within thirty (30) days
after receipt by Purchaser of the Objection Notice, the matters remaining in
dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 8.6, Section 8.7 and Section
8.8.

  



  

(iii) Payments due to Sellers shall be made by Purchaser by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by each
Seller in writing from time to time (but in any event not later than three
(3) Business Days prior to the date of payment) within five (5) Business Days
following the amount payable to the Sellers hereunder being finally determined
in accordance with Section 4.7(g)(ii) above.

4.10 _No Transfer_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Closing and such time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1, no Seller shall discuss, pursue, solicit, initiate,
participate in, facilitate, encourage or otherwise enter into any
transactions, discussions, negotiations, agreements or other arrangements
regarding or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, a sale, transfer,
assignment or other disposition of any Membership Interests

  



    

 | -18-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

to any Person other than Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ that
nothing in this Section 4.10 shall limit the ability of any Seller or its
Affiliates to discuss, pursue, solicit, initiate, participate in, facilitate,
encourage or otherwise enter into any transactions,
discussions, negotiations, agreements or other arrangements relating to a
direct or indirect change of control of the publicly traded parent of such
Seller, whether by the sale, liquidation, merger or other business combination
transaction, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
publicly traded parent of such Seller, in each case, whether or not in one or
more of a series of related or unrelated transactions; _provided_ , _further_
that it shall not be a breach of this Section 4.10 for a Seller to inform a
third party who has contacted Seller regarding a sale, transfer, assignment or
other disposition of any Membership Interests that such Seller is not
permitted to discuss such matters.

  



  

4.11 _Confidentiality; Nonsolicitation_ _._ In further consideration
for the payment of the Purchase Price and in order to protect the value of
the Membership Interests purchased by Purchaser (including the goodwill
inherent in the Company as of the Closing), upon the Closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Seller agrees as follows:

  



  

(a) As an owner of the Membership Interests, each Seller has had access
to and contributed to information and materials of a highly sensitive nature
(including Company Confidential Information) of the Company and its
subsidiary. Each Seller agrees that unless such Seller first secures the
written consent of Purchaser, such Seller shall not, and shall not permit its
Affiliates to, disclose to others any Company Confidential Information,
except (i) if required to do so by applicable Legal Requirements, including a
valid court order, or a Governmental Authority; _provided_ that, to the
extent legally permitted, such Seller promptly notifies the Company (in
advance, to the extent reasonably practicable) of the disclosure of such
information and, to the extent applicable, takes reasonable steps to minimize
the extent of any such required disclosure and request confidential treatment,
or (ii) to enforce or defend such Seller's rights under this Agreement or the
Related Agreements; _provided_ that any Seller shall be permitted to
disclose such financial statements of the Company as are necessary for such
Seller and its Affiliates to comply with its reporting obligations (as and if
applicable) under Regulation S-X, Rule 3-09. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Section 4.11 shall prevent Paramount from disclosing
information in accordance with Section 25 of the Paramount Output Agreement or
Lions Gate from disclosing information in accordance with Section 25 of the
Lions Gate Output Agreement. Each Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use all reasonable care to safeguard Company Confidential
Information and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and
theft; _provided_ that in no event shall a Seller have an obligation to use a
more stringent standard of care with respect to the Company Confidential
Information than the standard of care used by such Seller to safeguard its own
confidential information.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the Closing, each of Paramount and Lions Gate shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
destroy all Company Confidential Information in its possession and control, in
whatever form or medium, other than as may be required by applicable Legal
Requirements or as may be required to comply with internal document retention
and business continuity policies and procedures so long as the Company
Confidential Information remains subject to the confidentiality requirements
pursuant to Section 4.11(a); _provided_ that (x) nothing in this Section
4.11(b) shall require VII or its Affiliates to destroy any Company
Confidential Information used in connection with the continued provision of
services pursuant to the Services Agreement and (y) in no event shall
Paramount, Lions Gate or

  



    

 | -19-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

any of their Affiliates or Representatives be required to erase, destroy or
return information from any computer systems, hard drives, backup tapes or
archival systems, so long as the Company Confidential Information remains
subject to the confidentiality requirements pursuant to Section 4.11(a).

  



  

(c) Purchaser agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Company to destroy or cause to be destroyed all Viacom
Confidential Information known by the Company to be in the possession and
control of the Company and which was obtained by the Company prior to the
Closing Date, in whatever form or medium, other than as may be required by
applicable Legal Requirements or as may be required to comply with internal
document retention and business continuity policies and procedures; _provided_
that (x) nothing in this Section 4.11(c) shall require the Company or
Purchaser to destroy any Viacom Confidential Information included in
or incorporated by reference in the Company's contracts or that is reasonably
necessary for the Company and its subsidiary to conduct their businesses in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and (y) in no event shall
the Company be required to erase, destroy or return information from any
computer systems, hard drives, backup tapes or archival systems. Purchaser
agrees that unless Purchaser or the Company first secures the written consent
of VII, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, disclose
to others any information that is known or reasonably should be known by
Purchaser or the Company to constitute Viacom Confidential Information
obtained by the Company prior to the Closing Date, except (i) if required to
do so by applicable Legal Requirements, including a valid court order, or a
Governmental Authority; _provided_ that, to the extent legally
permitted, Purchaser or the Company promptly notifies VII (in advance, to the
extent reasonably practicable) of the disclosure of such information and, to
the extent applicable, takes reasonable steps to minimize the extent of any
such required disclosure and request confidential treatment, (ii) to enforce
or defend Purchaser's rights under this Agreement or the Related Agreements or
(iii) to the extent such Viacom Confidential Information was not required to
be destroyed pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 4.11(c), to their
Representatives or to a bona fide prospective or an actual buyer or financier
as well as the Representatives thereof ( _provided_  that any such buyer or
financier first executes a written confidentiality agreement pursuant to which
they/it agree(s) to be bound by the provisions of this provision or a similar
undertaking of confidentiality). Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company to, use all reasonable care to safeguard Viacom Confidential
Information and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and
theft; _provided_ that in no event shall Purchaser or the Company have an
obligation to use a more stringent standard of care with respect to the
Viacom Confidential Information than the standard of care used by Purchaser or
the Company (as the case may be) to safeguard its own confidential
information. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations set forth in this
Section 4.11 shall not extend to any Viacom Confidential Information in the
control or possession of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company and its subsidiary) not obtained as a consequence or result of being
an owner of membership interests of the Company.

  



  

(d) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, each of VII and
Paramount agrees that it shall not, directly or indirectly through its
controlled subsidiaries or any other Person encourage, induce, solicit or
attempt to encourage, induce or solicit any of the individuals listed on
Schedule 4.11(d)(i) to leave the employ of such Company Entity, and Lions
Gate agrees that it shall not, directly or indirectly through its controlled
subsidiaries or any other Person encourage, induce, solicit or attempt to

  



    

 | -20-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

encourage, induce or solicit any of the individuals listed on Schedule
4.11(d)(ii) to leave the employ of such Company Entity;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Section 4.11 shall not preclude any Seller or its direct
and indirect controlled subsidiaries from (A) placing general solicitations
not specifically directed at any of the officers or directors of a
Company Entity, or (B) hiring any officer or director who contacts such
Seller on such individual's own initiative.

  



  

(e) VII shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, and to
cooperate with the Company in respect of, the transfer employees to the
Company contemplated to be transferred pursuant to the Services Agreement and
not yet transferred as of the date hereof.

  



  

(f) Each Seller acknowledges and represents that: (i) sufficient
consideration has been given by each party to this Agreement to the other as
it relates hereto; (ii) such Seller has consulted with independent legal
counsel regarding his or her rights and obligations under this Section 4.11;
(iii) such Seller fully understands the terms and conditions contained herein;
(iv) the restrictions and agreements in this Section 4.11 are reasonable in
all respects and necessary for the protection of the Company Entities and the
Company Confidential Information and goodwill and that, without such
protection, the Company Entities' customer and client relationship and
competitive advantage would be materially adversely affected; and (v) the
agreements in this Section 4.11 are an essential inducement to Purchaser to
enter into this Agreement and they are in addition to, rather than in
lieu of, any similar or related covenants to which such Seller is party or by
which it is bound.

  



  

(g) If at any time a court holds that the restrictions in this Section
4.11 are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto
agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under
such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area.
The parties hereto agree that any breach of the provisions contained in this
Section 4.11 will result in serious and irreparable injury and therefore
money damages would not be an adequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore,
in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provisions of this
Section 4.11 that is continuing, the Company and Purchaser, their successors
and assigns and any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement, in addition to
other rights and remedies existing in their favor, shall be entitled to
specific performance or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce, or
prevent any violations of, the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or
other security).

  



  

4.12 _Release_.

  



  

(a) Effective as of the Closing, each party hereto, for itself and on
behalf of each of its Affiliates (including, in the case of Purchaser, the
Company) and successors and assigns of each of them (collectively, the
"Releasors"), hereby unconditionally and irrevocably releases and forever
discharges the other parties, each of their Affiliates (including, in the
case of Purchaser, the Company), and each of their respective individual,
joint or mutual, past, present, and future officers, directors, managers,
equity holders, partners, employees, agents and representatives, and the
successors and assigns of each of them (individually, a "Releasee" and
collectively, "Releasees") from any and all setoffs, demands, Actions, causes
of action, Orders, obligations, Liens, contracts, indebtedness, losses,
costs, attorneys' fees, damages and liabilities whatsoever, whether known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at law and in equity (collectively,
"Claims"), which such party or its Affiliates (including, following
the Closing in the case of

  



    

 | -21-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Purchaser, the Company) now has, has ever had, or may hereafter have against
the respective Releasees arising contemporaneously with, prior to or after the
Closing Date out of any matter, cause, event or circumstance occurring
contemporaneously with or prior to the Closing Date, including any right to
indemnification, reimbursement from, or payment by any Releasee, whether
pursuant to the JV Term Sheet, the Services Agreement, or any contract
(including between any Releasor and any Releasee), Legal Requirement, or
otherwise, in each case, to the extent relating to the operation, management
or ownership of the Company or its business in each case on or prior to the
Closing Date (collectively, the "Released Claims"); provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Section 4.12 (i) will operate to release any Claim
against or obligation of any Releasee arising under (A) the Services
Agreement, to the extent relating to services performed following the
Closing, (B) the Paramount Output Agreement, as amended by the Paramount
Output Agreement Amendment, or (C) the Lions Output Agreement, as amended by
the Lions Gate Output Agreement Amendment (including, for clarity, Lions
Gate's obligation to continue indemnifying the Company with respect to the
Action set forth in Section 2.7, item 2 of the VII Disclosure Schedule); (ii)
constitutes a release with respect to or affects any rights that any Releasor
may have pursuant to this Agreement or the Related Agreements or any breach
or default thereof, or (iii) constitutes a release of any Claim resulting
from a Releasee\'s fraud.

  



  

(b) Each party represents and warrants to each Releasee that such party
and its Affiliates have not transferred, assigned, or otherwise disposed of
any part of or interest in any Released Claim.

  



  

(c) Each party, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby
irrevocably covenants not to (and Purchaser hereby irrevocably covenants to
cause the Company not to), directly or indirectly, assert any Claim, or
commence, institute, participate in or cause to be commenced or instituted,
any Action of any kind against any Releasee based upon any Released Claim.

  



  

(d) Each party intends to effect a complete and knowing waiver of its
rights, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, as set forth in this Section
4.12. Each party expressly represents and warrants that it has been advised by
its legal counsel, and understands and acknowledges the significance and
consequence of the release set forth in this Section 4.12.

  



  

(e) Each party acknowledges and agrees that this Section 4.12 does not
constitute in any manner whatsoever an admission of liability on its part or
on the part of any Releasee for any Released Claim, and that such liability is
specifically denied.

Article VI 
 TAX TREATMENT/Tax Matters

  



  

6.1 _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a) Each of Purchaser and the Sellers intend that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the purchase and sale of the Membership Interests shall
be treated as a sale by the Sellers of the Membership Interests and as a
purchase by Purchaser of the Sellers' pro rata portions (based upon their
respective Membership Interests percentage holdings of the Company prior to
the Closing) of the assets of the Company pursuant to Revenue Ruling 99-6,
1999-1 C.B. 432. Accordingly, for purposes of allocating the income,
gains, losses, deductions and credits of the Company, Purchaser and Sellers
agree that the Company's taxable year shall end on the Closing Date. Unless
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements, each of Purchaser and the
Sellers shall prepare and file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
such treatment.

  



  

(b) All Pass-Through Income Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practices unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements. Not later than twenty-five (25)
days prior to the due date (taking into account extensions validly obtained)
of a Pass-Through Income Tax Return, Purchaser shall cause the Company to
deliver a copy of such draft Pass-Through Income Tax Return (as well as a
copy of the supporting tax work papers therefor) to each Seller for its review
and comment. Each Seller

  



    

 | -24-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

shall provide to Purchaser any comments the Seller may have with respect to
any such Pass-Through Income Tax Return within ten (10) days of its receipt.
Each Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disputes
regarding any such Pass-Through Income Tax Return within five (5) days of
Purchaser receiving such Seller's comments, _provided_ that if any such
dispute cannot be resolved within such time period, such Pass-Through Income
Tax Return shall be filed in a manner that is consistent with the position of
the parties that held a majority of the membership interests of the Company
immediately prior to the Closing. Not later than thirty (30) days after
filing any Pass-Through Income Tax Return, Purchaser shall cause the Company
to deliver a copy of such Pass-Through Income Tax Return as filed to each
Seller.

  



  

6.2 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Purchaser and the Sellers shall
consult and attempt in good faith to agree on a schedule setting forth the
allocation of the Purchase Price to the assets of the Company for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, and none
of Purchaser or the Sellers shall take any position on any Tax Return or with
any taxing authority that is inconsistent with such agreed allocation. In the
event that Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to reach agreement under
this Section 6.2, each of Purchaser and the Sellers shall be responsible for
determining its own allocation of the Purchase Price for use on its Tax
Returns in accordance with the Code and applicable Legal Requirements.

  



  

6.3 _Tax Claims_. Following the Closing, the conduct of any Tax
audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any Pass-
Through Income Tax Return (a "Tax Claim") shall be jointly controlled by the
Sellers and Purchaser. Purchaser shall provide each other member of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Member")
notice informing such other Pre-Closing Member that the Company is the
subject of a Tax Claim and shall keep each other Pre-Closing
Member reasonably informed of material developments relating to such Tax
Claim. Any dispute as to the conduct of a Tax Claim shall be resolved in
favor of the position of the Pre-Closing Members holding a majority of the
Company membership interests immediately before the Closing. Except as stated
in this Section 6.3, Pre-Closing Members shall have the same rights with
respect to Tax Claims as they have prior to the Closing.

  



  

6.4   _Cooperation_. Purchaser and the Sellers agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to the other, and Purchaser agrees to cause the Company
to furnish or cause to be furnished to the Sellers, upon request, as promptly
as practicable, such information and assistance relating to Taxes, including
access to books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all
Tax Returns and Tax refund claims, the making of any election relating to
Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Governmental Authority, the
determination of any liability for Taxes and the prosecution or defense of
any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Taxes. Each of Purchaser and the
Company shall retain all books and records in their possession with respect
to Taxes of the Company for a period of at least seven (7) years following
the Closing Date.

  



  

6.5 _Conveyance Taxes_. All Conveyance Taxes arising that may be
imposed as a result of the Purchase shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50%
by the Sellers. The Person(s) required to do so by applicable Legal
Requirements shall prepare and file (with the reasonable cooperation of the
Sellers, Purchaser and the Company) all necessary Tax Returns with respect to
Conveyance Taxes.

occurred by June 30, 2017 (the "End Date");  _provided_ that if on the End
Date all of the conditions set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 have
been satisfied (or, with respect to conditions that by their terms are to be

occurred) other than the condition set forth in Section 5.1(a), then any party
hereto shall have the right to extend the End Date for an additional sixty
(60) day period; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to
any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Purchase to occur on or before such date and
such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement;

  



  

(c) by any Seller or by Purchaser if any court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order,
or taken any other action, in each case, making illegal or permanently
prohibiting, enjoining or preventing the consummation of any of the
Transactions, and such Order or other action shall have become final and non-
appealable;

  



  

(d) by Purchaser, if there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty or any failure to perform any covenant or
agreement of the Sellers in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth
in Section 5.2 would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or
inaccuracy or failure to perform and such breach, inaccuracy or failure to
perform is not capable of being cured on or prior to the End Date or, if
capable of being cured, has not been cured within thirty (30) Business
Days after written notice thereof to the Sellers; _provided_ that Purchaser
is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions
set forth in Sections 5.1 or 5.3 to not be satisfied; or

  



  

(e) by any Seller if there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty or any failure to perform any covenant or
agreement of Purchaser in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
Section 5.3 would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or
inaccuracy or failure to perform and such breach, inaccuracy or failure to
perform is not capable of being cured on or prior to the End Date or, if
capable of being cured, has not been cured within thirty (30) Business
Days after written notice thereof to Purchaser; _provided_ that such Seller
is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions
set forth in Sections 5.1 or 5.2 to not be satisfied.

  



  

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Purchaser,
the Sellers or their respective officers, directors, stockholders, managers
or members, if applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that each party
hereto shall remain liable for any of its (or its Affiliates') willful,
material breaches of this Agreement prior to termination;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the provisions of Section 4.3 (Expenses), Section 4.4 (Public
Disclosure;

  



    

 | -26-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Confidentiality), Article VIII (General Provisions) and this Section 7.2
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Article VII.

  



  

7.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed by all
parties hereto.

  



  

7.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, all the
Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, may, to the
extent permitted under any applicable Legal Requirement, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party (or parties)
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party (or parties) contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the
covenants, agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party (or
parties) contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other
provision, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a
continuing waiver.
