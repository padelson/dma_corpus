2.1 Purchase and Sale of Purchased Interests. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, following the Conversions,
Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver the Purchased
Interests to Purchaser, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than (i)
applicable restrictions on future transfers by Purchaser arising under
applicable securities Laws and/or Gaming Laws, and (ii) those arising out of
acts of Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the Closing), and
Purchaser shall purchase from Seller, the Purchased Interests for the
consideration specified in Section 2.2.

2.2 Purchase Price. Subject to the adjustments set forth in this Article II,
the aggregate consideration for the Purchased Interests shall be an amount
equal to:

(a) an amount in cash equal to One Hundred Twenty Million Dollars
($120,000,000);

(b) minus, the amount (if any) by which the Reference Working Capital exceeds
the Working Capital;

(c) plus, the amount (if any) by which the Working Capital exceeds the

(f) plus, the Illinois Sports Betting Licenses Costs;

(g) minus, the Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies;

(h) minus, the Transaction Costs; and

(i) minus, the Pre-Closing Tax Credit Benefit (if any).

(the sum of clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i), the
"Purchase Price").

2.3 Estimate of Purchase Price.

(a) On or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall prepare and deliver a statement to Purchaser (the "Estimated
Closing Statement"), stating Seller's reasonable, good faith estimate of: (i)
the Working Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital"), (ii) all Indebtedness
of the Acquired Companies as of immediately prior to the Closing (the
"Estimated Indebtedness"), (iii) all Transaction Costs (the "Estimated
Transaction Costs"), (iv) the Closing Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash"), (v)
the Illinois Sports Betting Licenses Costs (the "Estimated Illinois Sports
Betting Licenses Costs"), and, based thereon (vi) the Estimated Purchase
Price, along with reasonably detailed calculations of each of the foregoing,
and reasonable backup documentation regarding the calculation of such amounts.
The Estimated Closing Statement (and the components thereof) shall be prepared
and calculated in accordance with GAAP.

(b) Following receipt of the Estimated Closing Statement, Seller shall permit
Purchaser and its Representatives, upon written request (which may be by
electronic mail), to review Seller's and the Acquired Companies' working
papers relating to the calculation and preparation of the Estimated Working
Capital, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Transaction Costs, Estimated
Closing Cash and Estimated Illinois Sports Betting Licenses Costs, and Seller
shall make reasonably available its Representatives (if any) responsible for
the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement in order to respond to the
inquiries of Purchaser and its Representatives. Prior to the Closing, the
parties shall reasonably attempt to resolve any disagreements concerning the
computation of any of the items included in the Estimated Closing Statement in
good faith; provided, that, it is acknowledged and agreed that if any
disagreements cannot be resolved, then the Closing shall not be delayed and
shall occur on the basis of the Estimated Closing Statement provided by
Seller, and that any unresolved disagreements shall be deferred for resolution
pursuant to the post-closing purchase price adjustment process described in
Section 2.4.

2.4 Determination of Purchase Price; Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Chips; Front Money.

(i) During the period in which the Casino and Hotel is closed for gaming
operations on the morning of the Closing Date and subject to applicable Law,
Seller shall conduct a cash count and the drop for one hundred percent (100%) of the Acquired
Companies' gaming device "drop boxes" as well as a count of such Acquired
Companies' liability for all outstanding chips, tokens, tickets and similar
cash equivalents (the "Company's Chips"). Subject to applicable Law,
representatives of Purchaser may be present to observe such cash count, drop
box count, and Company's Chips liability count if Purchaser so elects, and
such cash count, drop box count, and Company's Chips liability count shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, absent manifest error, and
shall be used in the preparation of the Closing Date Cash and Closing Date
Working Capital that is contained in the Post-Closing Statement (it being
understood that the aggregate value of all outstanding Company's Chips will
constitute a Current Liability in connection with the calculation of the
Closing Date Working Capital).

(ii) Effective as of Closing, Representatives of each of Purchaser and Seller
shall take inventory of all Front Money and identify what Persons are entitled
to what portions of such Front Money. All such Front Money shall be retained
in the cages of the Casino and Hotel and listed in an inventory prepared and
signed jointly by Representatives of Purchaser and Seller no later than the
Closing. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall distribute Front Money
only to the Persons and only in the amounts as determined pursuant to this
Section 2.4(a)(ii).

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable but in no event more than sixty (60)
days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver a
statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth Purchaser's reasonable,
good faith determination of (i) the Working Capital (the "Closing Date Working
Capital"), (ii) all Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies as of immediately
prior to the Closing (the "Closing Date Indebtedness"), (iii) all Transaction
Costs (the "Closing Date Transaction Costs"), (iv) the Closing Cash (the
"Closing Date Cash"), (v) the Illinois Sports Betting Licenses Costs as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing Date Illinois Sports Betting
Licenses Costs") and, based thereon, (vi) its calculation of the Purchase
Price (the "Closing Date Purchase Price"). The Post-Closing Statement
(including the Closing Date Working Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness,
the Closing Date Cash, and the Closing Date Transaction Costs) shall be
prepared and calculated in accordance with GAAP. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Post-Closing Statement shall not include any assets or liabilities that
would otherwise be recorded on the Acquired Companies' consolidated balance
sheet, prepared in accordance with GAAP as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, which are the result of any financing or other related
transaction effected by or at the direction of Purchaser.

(c) Seller and its accountants shall complete their review of the Post-Closing
Statement within forty-five (45) days after Purchaser's delivery thereof to
Seller. During such review period, Purchaser shall permit Seller and its
Representatives, upon written request (which may be by electronic mail), to
review Purchaser's and the Acquired Companies' working papers relating to the
calculation and preparation of the Post-Closing Statement, and Purchaser shall
make reasonably available its Representatives (if any) responsible for the
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement in order to respond to the
reasonable inquiries of Seller and its Representatives. On or before the last
day of such forty-five (45) day period, Seller may deliver to Purchaser a
certificate (signed by an authorized officer of Seller) (a "Dispute Notice")
setting forth any of Seller's objections to the calculation of any of the
components in the Post-Closing Statement, together with reasonably detailed
reasons therefor and calculations which, in its view, are necessary to
eliminate such objections. If Seller does not deliver any Dispute Notice to
Purchaser within such forty-five (45) day period, then all items described in the Post-Closing Statement
delivered by Purchaser to Seller shall be deemed agreed, final and binding on
the parties. If Seller timely delivers a Dispute Notice, then all items
described in the Post-Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser to Seller,
other than those items which Seller specifically describes an objection to in
the Dispute Notice, shall be deemed agreed, final and binding on the parties.

(d) Purchaser and Seller shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputes
related to a Dispute Notice within the thirty (30) day period (the
"Negotiating Period") following the delivery by Seller of a Dispute Notice. If
Purchaser and Seller are able to resolve all disputed amounts or other
disputes identified in the Dispute Notice, the Post-Closing Statement, as
modified to reflect such resolution, shall be deemed agreed, final and binding
on the parties. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve all of their
disagreements with respect to the proposed adjustments set forth in a timely
delivered Dispute Notice during the Negotiating Period, then within thirty
(30) days following the end of the Negotiating Period, they shall jointly
retain the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed only to
resolve all outstanding disagreements relating to the Post-Closing Statement
and the components reflected thereon, and shall be instructed not to otherwise
investigate such matters independently or introduce different judgments,
accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies in connection therewith. The
Accounting Firm shall investigate only those items that Purchaser and Seller
have been unable to resolve and shall not assign a value to any item that is
(i) greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either of
Purchaser or Seller or (ii) lower than the lowest value for such item claimed
by either of Purchaser or Seller. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall execute
and deliver a customary engagement letter as may be reasonably requested by
the Accounting Firm. Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the Accounting Firm
that, within five (5) Business Days following its acceptance of its
appointment as the Accounting Firm, it shall deliver to Purchaser and Seller a
written notice (B) no sooner than thirty (30) days following the date of
delivery of the Accountant Notice (unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing
among the Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller) and no later than forty-five
(45) days following the date of delivery of the Accountant Notice), and (y)
the format in which Purchaser and Seller are to submit their written
presentations (which format shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and
Seller). A copy of all materials submitted to the Accounting Firm pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence shall be provided to the Accounting Firm by
Purchaser and Seller, as applicable, no later than the deadline set forth in
the Accountant Notice (as the same may be amended by the mutual written
consent of the Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller), and a copy of such
materials shall be provided to the other party hereto concurrently with the
submission thereof to the Accounting Firm. Purchaser and Seller shall instruct
the Accounting Firm to promptly, but in no event later than ninety (90) days
after delivery of the Accountant Notice, determine (based solely on the
written presentations of Purchaser and Seller timely delivered to the
Accounting Firm in accordance with this Section 2.4(d) and in accordance with
the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and not by
independent review) only those matters in dispute and to render a written
report as to the calculations of the disputed amounts, which report, absent
manifest error, shall thereupon be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto for all purposes hereunder. Upon the decision of the Accounting Firm,
the Post-Closing Statement, as adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the
Accounting Firm's decision, shall be the final Post- Closing Statement. The fees, costs, and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne by Purchaser and Seller based on the inverse of the percentage that
the Accounting Firm's determination (before such allocation) bears to the
total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the
Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to
$1,000 and the Accounting Firm award $600 in favor of the Seller's position,
60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Purchaser and 40% of the
costs would be borne by Seller. The fees and expenses of Purchaser and its
Representatives incurred in connection with the Post-Closing Statement and any
Dispute Notice shall be borne by Purchaser, and the fees and expenses of
Seller and its Representatives in connection with the Post-Closing Statement
and any Dispute Notice shall be borne by Purchaser.

(e) The Post-Closing Statement, including the Closing Date Indebtedness, the
Closing Date Working Capital, the Closing Date Transaction Costs, the Closing
Date Cash, the Closing Date Illinois Sports Betting Licenses Costs and the
Closing Date Purchase Price as agreed to (or deemed to have been agreed to)
between Purchaser and Seller or as determined by the Accounting Firm, as
applicable, shall be conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto and
shall be deemed the "Actual Indebtedness," "Actual Working Capital," "Actual
Transaction Costs," "Actual Closing Cash," "Actual Illinois Sports Betting
Licenses Costs" and "Actual Purchase Price," respectively, for all purposes
herein.

(f) Upon completion of the calculation of the Actual Indebtedness, Actual
Working Capital, Actual Transaction Costs, Actual Closing Cash, Actual
Illinois Sports Betting Licenses Costs and Actual Purchase Price in accordance
with this Section 2.4, the following payments shall be made:

(i) If the Purchase Price calculated using the Actual Indebtedness, Actual
Working Capital, Actual Transaction Costs, Actual Closing Cash and Actual
Illinois Sports Betting Licenses Costs is greater than the Estimated Purchase
Price, then Purchaser shall promptly (but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after the final determination) pay such difference to Seller.

(ii) If the Purchase Price calculated using the Actual Indebtedness, Actual
Working Capital, Actual Transaction Costs, Actual Closing Cash and Actual
Illinois Sports Betting Licenses Costs is less than the Estimated Purchase
Price, then Seller shall promptly (but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after the final determination) pay such difference to Purchaser.

2.5 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
purchase and sale of the Purchased Interests contemplated by this Agreement
shall take place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at the offices of
Jones Day, 600 Brickell Ave., Suite 3300, Miami, FL 33131 (or pursuant to the
electronic or other remote exchange of all executed documents and other
closing deliverables required by Section 2.6) on or prior to the third (3rd)
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the
obligations of the parties set forth in Article VI (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to

those conditions), or at such other time and place as Purchaser and Seller may
mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the Closing takes place is referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). The

the Acquired Companies by Purchaser to the capital of the Acquired Companies
by Purchaser in exchange for the stock of the Acquired Companies acquired in
the Contemplated Transactions in a transaction to which Section 351 of the
Code applies, consistent with Section 1361(b)(3)(C)(ii) of the Code and
Treasury regulations Section 1.1361-5. Purchaser and Seller agree to allocate
the Purchase Price (including, for purposes of this Section 2.10, any other
consideration treated as paid by Buyer to Seller for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, including any liabilities of the Acquired Companies deemed assumed)
among the assets of the Acquired Companies in the manner set forth on Schedule
2.10 (the "Allocation Guidelines") which schedule has been prepared in a
manner consistent with Code Section 338 and 1060 and related Treasury regulations. Within ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a proposed schedule (the
"Proposed Allocation Schedule") allocating the Purchase Price (including, for
purposes of this Section 2.10, any other consideration treated as paid to
Seller for tax purposes, including any liabilities of the Acquired Companies
deemed assumed) among the assets of the Acquired Companies in a manner
consistent with the Allocation Guidelines. Purchaser shall make such revisions
to the Proposed Allocation Schedule as are timely and reasonably requested by
Seller within thirty (30) days of Purchaser's receipt of the Proposed
Allocation Schedule. If Seller does not notify Purchaser in writing following
Seller\'s receipt of the Proposed Allocation Schedule that Seller objects
and/or has revisions to the Proposed Allocation Schedule, the Proposed
Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding upon the parties to this
Agreement. If within such thirty (30)-day period Seller so notifies Purchaser,
Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the disputed
matters. If Seller and Purchaser are able to resolve the disputed matters
within thirty (30) days following Purchaser's receipt of Seller's notice of
objection, Seller and Purchaser shall revise the Proposed Allocation Schedule
to reflect such resolution, and the revised Proposed Allocation Schedule shall
be final and binding upon the parties to this Agreement. If Seller and
Purchaser fail to reach agreement despite their good faith efforts within
thirty (30) days following Purchaser's receipt of Seller's notice of
objection, then the Accounting Firm shall settle any disputed matters and the
provisions of Section 2.4(d) shall apply, mutatis mutandis. The Proposed
Allocation Schedule as revised pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be the
"Allocation Schedule." The Proposed Allocation Schedule and the Allocation
Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance with this
Section 2.10 and Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations thereunder. Purchaser and Seller shall file IRS Form 8594, and all
federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns, in accordance with the
Allocation Schedule. Purchaser and Seller each agrees to provide the other
promptly with any other information required to complete Form 8594.

2.11 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any
applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement any withholding Taxes or other
amounts required under the Code or any applicable Law to be deducted and
withheld, and shall promptly remit such amounts to the applicable Governmental
Authority; (in each case, without regard to any ability to defer Taxes under
the Presidential Memorandum of August 8, 2020 or similar legislation, orders
or guidance). If Purchaser or any other applicable withholding agent intends
to withhold any amount pursuant to any Tax Law, other than compensatory
withholding, then Purchaser will notify Seller of such planned withholding and
cooperate with Seller, at no out of pocket costs to Purchaser, in good faith
to eliminate or mitigate such withholding in a matter consistent with
applicable Law. To the extent that any amounts are deducted or withheld by
Purchaser, the Company or any other applicable withholding agent, such
deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
withholding was made provided such amounts are remitted by Purchaser to the
applicable Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, any amounts paid to or for the benefit of any Person pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement that constitute wages or compensation subject
to employment or similar Tax may be paid to an Acquired Company or MSI, which
in turn shall pay the applicable Person such amounts (less applicable
employment or similar Tax, which shall be withheld and deposited with the
appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law). Any
amounts withheld hereunder as described in the preceding sentence will be
treated as having been paid to the Person on whose behalf such withholding was 2.12 Deposit

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the date hereof,
Purchaser has paid to the Seller an amount in cash equal to $4,000,000.00 (the
"Initial Deposit", and, together with any Deposit Increases, collectively, the
"Deposit"), which Deposit shall be credited towards the payment of the
Purchase Price at Closing, and shall otherwise be administered in accordance
with this Agreement.

(b) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Parties, Seller shall hold the Deposit in a separate, interest bearing,
account (the "Deposit Account"), which funds shall not be removed, transferred
or otherwise accessed except pursuant to Section 8.3. If the Closing occurs,
the Deposit shall be credited against the payment of the Purchase Price at the
Closing as provided in Section 2.7.

(c) In the event of a termination of this Agreement, the Deposit shall be paid
by or returned to Purchaser as applicable, as provided in Section 8.3. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that payment by
Purchaser to Seller of the Deposit does not entitle Purchaser or its
Affiliates to any acquisition of control of an Acquired Company, such control
remaining vested at all times with Seller until such time as the Closing
occurs.

(including any Acquired Company) has offered any bonus or other direct
inducement to customers of the Casino and Hotel to sign up for such customer
lists or social gaming applications. In addition, since January 1, 2020 until

the Common Information) other than, in the case of clause (i) and (ii) of this
Section 3.21(b), to third parties to use or process such information solely on
the Company's behalf pursuant to those Contracts set forth on Schedule
3.21(b), Governmental Authorities as required by Law, or vendors and

date hereof, and, assuming Purchaser has complied with its obligations to pay
the Estimated Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.7(a), shall be Solvent
immediately following the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. As
used herein, "Solvent" means, for any Person and as of any date of
determination, that (a) the amount of the "present fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person shall, as of such date, exceed the amount of all
"liabilities of such Person, contingent or otherwise," as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, (b) the
present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person shall, as of such date, be greater
than the amount that shall be required to pay the liability of such Person on
its indebtedness as its indebtedness becomes absolute and matured, (c) such
Person shall not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of
capital with which to conduct its businesses and (d) as of such date, such

bound or that affect the Owned Real Property. No material default exists under
the Governmental Incentive Documents on the part of Seller or any Acquired
Company. There are no material obligations to be performed by Seller or any
Acquired Company under the Governmental Incentive Documents that have not been
performed in full.

Purchaser nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty as to
Purchaser, except as expressly set forth in Article IV of this Agreement
(including the related portions of the Disclosure Schedules), ancillary
documents entered into in connection with this Agreement or in a certificate
delivered by Purchaser in connection with this Agreement. Seller acknowledges
and agrees that in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions, Seller is relying solely upon its
own investigation and the express representations and warranties of set forth
in Article IV of this Agreement (including the related portions of the
Disclosure Schedules), ancillary documents entered into in connection with
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Purchaser in connection with
this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 3.26 shall not, and shall not
be deemed or construed to, waive, release or limit any rights or remedies of
any Seller Indemnified Party for claims based upon fraud.

and warranties contained in Article III and Section 9.17(b) (including the
Disclosure Schedule delivered pursuant hereto), ancillary documents entered
into in connection with this Agreement or in any certificates delivered by
Seller or any Acquired Company in connection with the Closing, neither Seller
nor any Person on behalf of Seller or any Acquired Company has made or makes,
any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Seller, to the Acquired Companies or with respect to any other information
provided or made available to Purchaser in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 3.27 shall limit
the rights or remedies of any Purchaser Indemnified Party for claims based
upon fraud.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

Except as set forth on the Disclosure Schedules, Purchaser hereby represents
and warrants to Seller that the following representations and warranties are
true and correct as of the time of execution of this Agreement and as of
Closing:

4.1 Organization. Purchaser is a corporation (a) duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and (b)
with all requisite corporate power and authority to own and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as presently conducted. 4.2 Authority; Binding Nature. Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the Related Agreements to which it
is a party and to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The execution and delivery by
Purchaser of this Agreement and the Related Agreements to which it is a party
has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Purchaser and
no other proceedings (corporate or otherwise) on the part of Purchaser or its
board of directors or stockholders are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement and the
Related Agreements to which Purchaser is a party have been duly executed and
delivered by Purchaser and constitute (assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Seller, Parent, and the Acquired Companies) the
legal, valid and binding obligations of Purchaser enforceable against
Purchaser in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, moratorium, restructuring or other Laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally and general principles of equity
(irrespective of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity).

4.3 No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this
Agreement and the Related Agreements and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions do not and will not, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both, conflict with, contravene, result in any violation of or default under,
or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation under, or require a consent or waiver under, (a) subject to the
approvals, consents, filings and other matters referred to in Section 4.4, any
Law or Order applicable to Purchaser, (b) any terms or conditions of
Purchaser's Charter Documents, or (c) any material Contract to which Purchaser
is a party or by which Purchaser or any of its assets is bound other than as
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

4.4 Consents and Approvals. No consent, approval, authorization or other
action by, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority on
the part of Purchaser is required in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement and the Related Agreements to
which it is a party or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions,
except (i) as required under the HSR Act, (ii) as required under Gaming Laws,
or (iii) such other filings, consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
permits, registrations and declarations as may be required under the Laws of
any jurisdiction in which Purchaser conducts any business or owns any assets,
the failure of which to make or obtain would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to materially impair or materially delay the
Closing.

4.5 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there are no Proceedings pending or, to
Purchaser's Knowledge, threatened against Purchaser, and Purchaser is not
subject to or bound by any Order which, if determined adversely, would be
reasonably expected to result in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

4.6 Licensability. Neither Purchaser nor any of its current officers,
directors, managers, key executives, Affiliates (any such Persons, including
Purchaser, the "Licensing Affiliates") has ever had an application for a
Gaming Approval be denied, terminated, suspended, limited, revoked, or
withdrawn by a Governmental Authority. Purchaser and, to Purchaser's
Knowledge, each of its Licensing Affiliates that are licensed under applicable
Gaming Laws (collectively, the "Licensed Parties") are in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which the
Licensed Parties own or operate gaming facilities. To Purchaser's Knowledge,
there are no facts, which if known to any Governmental Authority would (a) be
reasonably likely to result in the denial, revocation, limitation or
suspension of a gaming license currently held or other Gaming Approval of any
of the Licensed Parties, or (b) result in a negative outcome to any finding of
suitability proceedings of any Licensed Parties currently pending as of the
date hereof, or under the suitability proceedings necessary for the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

4.7 Sufficiency of Funds. Purchaser has sufficient cash on hand or access to
other sources of available funds, including access to available funds of TRWH
or available lines of credit to which TRWH has access, to enable it to pay the
Purchase Price and consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

4.8 Permits; Compliance with Gaming Laws.

(a) Purchaser, and, to Purchaser's Knowledge, each of the Licensed Parties
hold all permits, registrations, findings of suitability, licenses, variances,
exemptions, certificates of occupancy, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Authorities (including all authorizations under Gaming Laws)
necessary to conduct the business and operations of Purchaser (the "Purchaser
Permits"), each of which is in full force and effect in all material respects,
except for such Purchaser Permits, the failure of which to hold would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect, and no event has occurred which permits, or upon the
giving of notice or passage of time or both would reasonably be expected to
permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or
termination of the Purchaser Permits that are currently in effect, the loss of
which would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have
a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Purchaser, and to Purchaser's Knowledge,
the Licensed Parties are in compliance with the terms of the Purchaser
Permits, except for such failures to comply, as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect. Purchaser has not received notice of any investigation or review by
any Governmental Authority with respect to Purchaser that is pending, and, to
Purchaser's Knowledge, no investigation or review is threatened, nor has any
Governmental Authority indicated in writing any intention to conduct the same,
other than those the outcome of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Neither Purchaser, nor, to the Purchaser's Knowledge, any Licensed Party
has received any written claim, demand, notice, complaint, court order or
administrative order from any Governmental Authority in the past three (3)
years under, or relating to, any violation or possible violation of any Gaming
Laws, other than as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. To Purchaser's
Knowledge, there are no facts, which if known to the regulators under the
Gaming Laws could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
limitation or suspension of a Purchaser Permit or have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2017, neither Purchaser nor, to Purchaser's
Knowledge, any other Licensed Party, has suffered a suspension or revocation
of any Purchaser Permit, other than those the outcome of which would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect. 4.9 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Purchaser.

4.10 Independent Investigation Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that in
making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions, Purchaser is relying solely upon its own
investigation and the express representations and warranties of set forth in
Article III and Section 9.17(b) of this Agreement (including the related
portions of the Disclosure Schedules), ancillary documents entered into in
connection with this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Seller in
connection with this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 4.9 shall not,
and shall not be deemed or construed to, waive, release or limit any claims of
Purchaser based upon fraud.

4.11 No Other Representations and Warranties. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that none of Seller, the Company or any other Person has made any
representation or warranty as to Seller or any Acquired Company, except as
expressly set forth in Article III and Section 9.17(b) of this Agreement
(including the related portions of the Disclosure Schedules), ancillary
documents entered into in connection with this Agreement or in a certificate
delivered by Seller in connection with this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 4.11 to the contrary, nothing in this Section 4.11
shall limit the rights or remedies of any Purchaser Indemnified Party for
claims based upon fraud.

5.2 Approvals and Filings.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and Seller agrees to, and to cause
its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the Contemplated Transactions in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, including: (i) the obtainment of all necessary approvals under
any applicable Laws required in connection with this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions; (ii) the obtainment of all necessary actions or
non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations from Governmental
Authorities (including from all applicable Gaming Authorities) and the making
of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities under applicable liquor, or other applicable
alcoholic beverage, licensing Laws, Gaming Laws, and under the HSR Act), and
the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
from any Governmental Authority; (iii) the obtaining of all necessary waivers,
consents, approvals and authorizations from any third party, including those
set forth on Schedule 3.4; (iv) the prompt sharing of any information and
documentation relating to the Business to the extent such sharing is
reasonably necessary in obtaining any of the foregoing; and (v) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of Seller and Purchaser shall
make (or cause its ultimate parent entity, as such term is used in the
regulations implementing the HSR Act, to make) an appropriate filing pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the Contemplated Transactions (the "HSR
Filing") as promptly as practicable and in any event within twenty (20)
Business Days following the date hereof; and (ii) Purchaser shall submit the
initial regulatory and licensing submissions required by the applicable Gaming
Authorities set forth on Schedule 5.2(b) to be submitted by Purchaser (the
"Regulatory and Licensing Submissions") no later than 11:59 p.m. central time
on October 15, 2020 (the "Initial Regulatory Filing Deadline").

(c) In addition to and without limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Acquired Companies, Seller and Purchaser shall, and their respective
Representatives and Affiliates shall, in reasonable consultation file all
required initial applications and documents in connection with obtaining the
Transaction Approvals by it or its Affiliates (including under applicable
Gaming Laws) as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, provided
that all required initial applications and documents in connection with obtaining approvals under applicable Gaming Laws shall be made within ninety
(90) days following the date hereof. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, each of Seller and the Acquired Companies, on one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall bear its own costs for the preparation of
such Transaction Approvals and responding to any inquiries or information
requests, if applicable. "Transaction Approvals" shall mean all approvals of
Governmental Authorities required for the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions under Gaming Laws, Antitrust Laws and any other applicable Law,
including any applicable liquor, or other applicable alcoholic beverage,
licensing Laws. Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to the request of any Governmental
Authority for additional information and material by supplying such
information or material as it reasonably believes is responsive to such
request, and shall cooperate with the other parties hereto in connection with
the making of all filings referenced in the preceding sentence, including,
subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, providing
copies of all such filed documents to the other parties hereto and their
Representatives (other than copies of personal applications made under
applicable Gaming Laws and any documents or information related thereto;
provided, that materials may be redacted as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns). Without
limiting the foregoing, unless a Governmental Authority requires otherwise,
each of Purchaser and Seller shall notify the other promptly of the receipt by
it or its Affiliates of written substantive and material comments or requests
from Governmental Authorities relating to any Transaction Approvals, and shall
supply the other with copies of all non-confidential material correspondence
between the notifying party or any of its Representatives and Governmental
Authorities with respect to such Transaction Approvals. Prior to Closing, each
of the Acquired Companies, Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to schedule and attend any hearings or meetings with Governmental
Authorities as promptly as reasonably practicable. From the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, each party hereto shall keep the other parties
hereto reasonably informed with respect to such party's pursuit of Transaction
Approvals from the date of this Agreement until the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement. In addition, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions herein provided and subject to the parties' (and to the extent
applicable, their respective Affiliates') obligations under applicable Law,
neither party will (and each party will cause, to the extent applicable, their
respective Affiliates not to) knowingly take, or cause to be taken, any action
that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
satisfaction by the Outside Date of the conditions set forth in Article VI of
this Agreement.

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.2 or any other provision of this Agreement shall
require Purchaser to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition
of, or prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation by, Purchaser
or any of its respective Affiliates of any portion of the business, properties
or assets of Purchaser, including the Acquired Companies or any assets
thereof, or any of its Affiliates; and in all events Purchaser shall not be
required pursuant to this Section 5.2(d) to propose, commit to or effect any
action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.2 shall be
deemed to limit any obligations Purchaser may have to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3, if such amount is owned pursuant (e) No party hereto shall independently participate in any substantive
communication initiated by such party or engaged in with advance notice from
such Governmental Authority, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any Gaming Approval, or the HSR Filing,
without giving the other party hereto prior notice of the communication and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to
attend and/or participate, in each case, to the extent practicable and
permitted by applicable Laws. Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto
will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to a
Proceeding under the HSR Act or any Law relating to the Gaming Approvals.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other provision of this
Agreement, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to, and shall
retain sole discretion in deciding whether to, litigate, defend against, or
otherwise contest any challenge, claim, lawsuit or other cause of action
relating to the Contemplated Transactions or this Agreement pursuant to or
under Gaming Laws, Antitrust Laws and any other applicable Law.

5.3 Access; Confidentiality.

(a) From the date hereof to the Closing Date or earlier termination of the
Agreement in accordance with Article VIII hereof, and subject to applicable
Gaming Laws, Seller and the Acquired Companies shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to, (i) afford Purchaser's Representatives, upon
reasonable prior written notice, which shall be directed to Seller as set
forth in Section 9.1 (or such other officer of Seller designated in writing),
reasonable access during normal business hours to the officers, employees,
agents (including outside accountants and financial advisors), properties,
offices and other facilities, books and records of the Acquired Companies and
(ii) furnish to Purchaser and its Representatives such financial and operating
data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request concerning
the Shares (or, following the Conversions, the Purchased Interests), the
Business and the operations of the Acquired Companies; provided, however, that
(y) Purchaser shall have no right to perform any invasive, subsurface,
destructive or physical testing, sampling or other environmental investigation
of any properties or facilities owned or operated by the Acquired Companies
without Seller's prior written consent (which consent may be withheld in
Seller's sole discretion), and (z) neither Seller nor any of the Acquired
Companies shall be required to violate any Order or Law to which Seller or an
Acquired Company is subject or to waive any privilege which Seller or an
Acquired Company may possess in discharging the obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.3, provided, however, that the parties shall reasonably cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to the extent
doing so would not be reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information. Prior to the Closing, without the
prior written consent of Seller, Purchaser shall not contact any suppliers to,
or customers of, the Company (except to the extent such communications are
limited to suppliers and customers of Purchaser or its Affiliates, and then
only to the extent relating to such supplier's or customer's business with
Purchaser or its Affiliates). Purchaser and its Representatives shall conduct
their investigations pursuant to this provision in such a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Business. (b) Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the
Non-Disclosure Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If this
Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Non-
Disclosure Agreement and the provisions of this Section 5.3(b) shall continue
in full force and effect unimpaired. Purchaser and Seller agree that, upon
Closing, the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall automatically terminate and have
no further force or effect. From and after the Closing, subject to Section
5.5, Seller agrees to treat in confidence all Confidential Information and all
other documents, materials and other information regarding the Acquired
Companies, the Business or the Shares (or, following the Conversions, the
Purchased Interests) or which it shall have obtained regarding Purchaser
during the course of the negotiations leading to the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions (whether obtained before or after the date of this
Agreement), the investigation provided for herein and the preparation of this
Agreement and other related documents provided, that Seller may disclose any
such documents, materials, and information to the extent required by
applicable Law and in such case, to the extent reasonably possible, Seller
shall provide Purchaser with notice of such requirement prior to making any
disclosure.

(c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

(d) As promptly as practicable, but subject to compliance with applicable
Gaming Laws, Seller will deliver to Purchaser copies of all license
applications and other filings made by any Acquired Company after the date
hereof and before the Closing Date with any Governmental Authority or Gaming
Authority with such redactions as are reasonably necessary to protect
nonpublic information related to the Seller (other than applications or other
filings made by individuals (though the Seller shall provide prompt notice to
the Purchaser of such applications or filings being submitted) and routine,
recurring applications and filings made in the Ordinary Course of Business).

5.4 Notification. Seller and the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall promptly (and in any event within three
(3) Business Days after becoming aware of any such Proceeding) notify the
other in writing of any (a) Proceeding instituted or threatened in writing
against such Person, or any Affiliate thereof, seeking to restrain, prohibit
or otherwise challenge the legality of the Contemplated Transactions, or (b)
or any change, occurrence or event which would reasonably be expected to cause
any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied;
provided that no such notification, nor the obligation to make such
notification, shall affect the representations, warranties or covenants, or
the conditions to the obligations of, any party to this Agreement or such
Person's liability therefor. Seller and the Acquired Companies, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, hereby acknowledge that the other
party does not waive any right it may have hereunder as a result of such
notifications.

5.5 Public Announcements. Seller and Purchaser shall agree on the form and
content of the initial press release regarding the Contemplated Transactions
and thereafter shall consult with each other before issuing, provide each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon and use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree upon, any press release or other public statement
with respect to any of the Contemplated Transactions and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation and prior to considering in good faith any such comments, except to the extent (a) such consultation or consideration
is not possible as a result of applicable Law (including applicable securities
Laws and any Gaming Laws) or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange (it being understood and agreed that
Purchaser may file one or more Current Reports on Form 8-K with the SEC in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions), or (b) such press release or
other public statement is consistent in all material respects with a press
release or other public statement previously approved by Seller and Purchaser.

5.6 No Control of the Acquired Companies. Except as permitted by the terms of
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Purchaser,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date. Until the Closing, the
operations and affairs of the Acquired Companies are the sole responsibility
and under the complete control of Seller, except as provided for in this
Agreement.

5.7 Employee Benefit Matters.

(a) The Acquired Companies shall terminate their participation in all Seller
Plans as of the Closing Date. Seller and the applicable Seller Plans shall
retain responsibility for all Liabilities relating to the Seller Plans,
including the liability for payment of all covered benefits and claims
(including medical, dental, life insurance and long-term disability) and
expenses incurred by all Employees and all MSI Employees (and all dependents
and beneficiaries of such Employees and MSI Employees) under such Seller
Plans. Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies,
following the Closing) shall be responsible for all Liabilities and
obligations in respect of benefits accrued after the Closing Date by the
Continuing Employees under the employee benefit plans of Purchaser and its
Affiliates, and neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall have any Liabilities
with respect thereto.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: (i) nothing in this
Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of Purchaser or the Acquired
Companies to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any
definite period following the Closing; and (ii) nothing in this Agreement
shall interfere with the right of Purchaser or its Affiliates to relocate or
terminate the employment of any of the Continuing Employees at any time after
the Closing Date. Purchaser or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall bear the
cost and expense of the termination of the employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliate of any Continuing Employee after the Closing.

(c) Schedule 5.7(c) includes a complete and accurate list of all MSI
Employees, which schedule shall, no later than five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, be updated with any changes to the roster or MSI Employees that
may occur after the date hereof consistent with the restrictions set forth in
Section 5.1(b). All MSI Employees are anticipated to transfer employment to
the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates in connection with the Closing.
Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall (or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to) offer employment (consistent with the requirements of Section
5.7(d)) to each MSI Employee who is employed by MSI as of immediately prior to
the Closing. Seller shall remain liable for all responsibilities and
obligations for continuation coverage under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and
any state continuation coverage requirements that arise with respect to the
MSI Employees and their beneficiaries and to all qualified beneficiaries of
covered employees, in each case for whom a "qualifying event" under COBRA occurs on or prior to the Closing Date and any other individuals who are
"MandA Qualified Beneficiaries" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
54.4980B-9 QandA-4(a)) with respect to the Contemplated Transactions. Seller
shall be responsible for, have all Liability with respect to, and shall
reimburse Purchaser, as applicable, for, any severance, paid time-off payout,
WARN Act Liability, or similar obligation (i) with respect to or arising from
any MSI Employee who receives but does not accept an offer of employment with
Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies and (ii) with respect to and
arising solely from the termination of any MSI Employee's employment with MSI
in connection with the hiring of such MSI Employee by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, any Acquired Company) (in each
case including the employer portion of any payroll, social security,
unemployment or similar Taxes related thereto). Purchaser shall be responsible
for, have all Liability with respect to, and shall reimburse MSI, as
applicable, for, any severance, paid time-off payout or similar obligation
with respect to or arising from the termination of employment of any MSI
Employee who is employed by MSI as of the Closing and who does not receive an
offer of employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, any Acquired Company).

(d) Purchaser shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Employee of the
Acquired Companies who continues to be employed by the Acquired Companies as
of the Closing Date or is otherwise employed by Purchaser or one of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and each MSI Employee who accepts
employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates as of the Closing (each
such person, a "Continuing Employee") shall, for the twelve (12) month period
after the Closing Date, be provided with (i) an annual base salary (or, in the
case of an hourly Continuing Employee, the base hourly wage rate) that is at
least equal to the annual base salary rate (or base hourly wage rate, as
applicable) payable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing, (ii) to the extent applicable to a Continuing Employee, a cash
incentive compensation opportunity that is substantially similar to that
provided by Purchaser to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser as of
the Closing Date; and (iii) other employee benefits (including severance) that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided by Purchaser to
similarly situated employees of the Purchaser.

(e) Purchaser shall ensure that each Continuing Employee receives full credit
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes
of benefit accrual) for service with the Acquired Companies or MSI (or
predecessor service credit under their employee benefit plans) under each of
the employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Purchaser or the relevant
Subsidiary, as applicable, in which such Continuing Employee becomes a
participant (collectively, the "Purchaser Plans"); provided, however, that no
such service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits. As of
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the relevant Subsidiary to,
credit to Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time and/or sick leave
that such employees had accrued under any applicable Employee Benefit Plan as
of the Closing Date; provided that, with respect to any Continuing Employees
who were employees of any Acquired Company or MSI as of immediately prior to
the Closing, such credit shall only be required to the extent that Liability
for such amount is recorded as a Current Liability in the Acquired Companies'
Financial Statements as of the Closing and, in the case of the MSI Employees,
as a Current Liability for purposes of calculating each of the Estimated
Working Capital, the Closing Date Working Capital and the Actual Working
Capital. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by
Purchaser or the relevant Subsidiary for the benefit of any Continuing
Employees, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to the consent of any applicable insurer to (i) cause to be waived any eligibility
waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application
of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan, subject to any
conditions, regulations, underwriting criteria or similar provisions imposed
by any of Purchaser's insurers, and (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit
for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs towards applicable co-
payments, deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses
incurred by the Continuing Employee prior to the Closing Date and for which
payment has been made, subject to any conditions, regulations, underwriting
criteria or similar provisions imposed by any of Purchaser's insurers.

(f) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, reasonably promptly following
the request by Purchaser, Seller and the Company each shall provide to
Purchaser such information related to the compensation and benefits of the
Continuing Employees as Purchaser may reasonably request to aid Purchaser in
complying with its obligations under this Section 5.7. Purchaser shall permit
each eligible Continuing Employee to, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, become a participant in a Purchaser Plan
constituting an "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code).

(g) The parties hereto shall coordinate with each other prior to the Closing
Date as to the form and content of any communication from Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates to the Continuing Employees, including communications about
employment offers. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall not disseminate any such communication without the prior approval of
Seller, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates from making any and all public
disclosures legally required to comply with any applicable Laws or requests of
any Governmental Authority, provided, that Purchaser shall provide Seller with
advance notice as to the form and content of any such disclosures.

(h) Following the Closing, each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such additional documents,
instruments, conveyances and assurances and take such further actions as may
be reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this Section 5.7.

(i) Nothing contained in this Section 5.7 or anywhere in this Agreement shall
(i) amend, establish or terminate, or be deemed to amend, establish or
terminate, or, subject to the limitation of Section 5.1(b)(xvii), prohibit the
amendment or termination of, any Employee Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit plan of Seller, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, (ii) create any
third party beneficiary rights in any Person, including any employee or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller, the
Acquired Companies, MSI or of any Affiliates of Seller or the Acquired
Companies in respect of continued or new employment with either Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, or otherwise provide any Person not a party to this
Agreement with any right, benefit or remedy with regard to any Employee
Benefit Plan or a right to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or (iii)
subject to the limitation of Section 5.1(b)(xvii), limit in any way the
ability of Purchaser, Seller or any of their Affiliates to amend or terminate
any Employee Benefit Plan at any time, subject to applicable Laws.

5.8 No Solicitation of Transaction. Each of Parent, the Acquired Companies and
Seller shall not, and Parent and Seller shall cause each of Seller and the
Acquired Companies, respectively, not to, and each of Parent, the Acquired Companies and Seller
shall not authorize or permit the respective Affiliates and Representatives
thereof to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate, entertain, or
conduct any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or
otherwise cooperate in any other way with, or facilitate or encourage any
effort to attempt to, or enter into any agreement, discussion, negotiation,
arrangement or understanding with, any Person or group of Persons regarding
any Acquisition Proposal or that is reasonably likely to result in an
Acquisition Proposal, (b) provide any assistance, information, documents or
cooperate or have discussions with, any Person (other than Purchaser and its
Representatives) in connection with any inquiry, offer, proposal or agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) afford any access to the personnel,
offices, facilities, properties, transaction data rooms or books and records
of the Acquired Companies to any Person (other than Purchaser and its
Representatives) relating to an Acquisition Proposal or (d) otherwise assist
or facilitate the making of, or cooperate in any way regarding any inquiry,
offer, proposal or agreement by any Person (other than Purchaser or its
Representatives) relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution
of this Agreement, each of Parent, the Acquired Companies and Seller shall,
and Parent and Seller shall cause each of Seller and the Acquired Companies,
respectively, to, immediately cease and terminate any activities, discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Person (other than Purchaser) with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will promptly request the return or
destruction of any confidential information provided to any Person in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 5.8 shall preclude Seller or its Representatives from contacting
any such party or parties solely for the purpose of complying with the
provisions of the first clause of this sentence. Seller and the Acquired
Companies shall promptly notify Purchaser if any Acquisition Proposal, or any
offer, proposal, agreement, inquiry or contact with any Person with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal, and will promptly notify any Person making an
Acquisition Proposal, or offer, proposal, agreement, inquiry or contact with
respect thereto about the existence of this exclusivity covenant (but will not
disclose the identity of the parties to this Agreement or any of the terms of
this Agreement unless such information has been previously disclosed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement) and each of Parent's, Seller's
and the Acquired Companies' and their Affiliates' and their and their
Affiliates' Representatives' unwillingness to discuss any Acquisition Proposal
until this Agreement is terminated.

5.9 Further Assurances.

(a) Upon written request by Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and Seller will,
and Seller will cause the Acquired Companies to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, during the period prior to the Closing Date, the consent,
approval or waiver, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, from any party to any Material Contract required to be obtained in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions; provided, that neither Seller
nor Purchaser shall have any obligation to offer or pay any material
consideration in order to obtain any such consents or approvals; and,
provided, further, that, the Acquired Companies and Seller shall not, and
Seller shall cause the Acquired Companies not to, make any agreement or
understanding affecting the Business as a condition to obtaining any such
consents or waivers, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser. Prior
to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in
attempting to obtain the consents, approvals and waivers contemplated by this
Section 5.9(a). (b) From and after the date hereof (including following the Closing), each of
the parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such other instruments of conveyance and transfer as may be reasonably
required to carry out the provisions hereof or to give effect to the
Contemplated Transactions.

(c) Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser as promptly as practicable following
the Closing, but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Closing,
three (3) USB drives containing a copy of those documents posted to the Data
Room as of the Closing.

5.10 Sportsbook Buildout and Capital Expenditures.

(a) Beginning on the later of (i) the date of this Agreement, and (ii) the
date the Purchaser has caused the Letter of Credit to be issued, until the
Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, at Purchaser's request,
each of Seller and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to
take such actions as Purchaser may reasonably request with respect to
facilitating the design, construction, buildout and furnishing of a sportsbook
within the Casino and Hotel (the "Sportsbook"), on the terms and condition set
forth in this Section 5.10. Purchaser, and to the extent that Purchaser has
identified and selected Purchaser's Management Services Provider, Purchaser's
Management Service Provider, shall determine the specifications of the
Sportsbook; provided, however, Seller's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required
prior to the approval of the project budget (and any subsequent changes to the
budget that result in an increase in the budget by more than five percent (5%)
in the aggregate from the most recent budget approved by Seller),
specifications related to the location and size of the Sportsbook within the
Casino and Hotel, and any other specifications that would reasonably be expected
to adversely impact the Business; provided further, that Purchaser shall in
establishing the specifications for the Sportsbook consider any other
commercially reasonable comments of Seller and the Company. Except for any
design, construction, buildout or furnishing of the Sportsbook pursuant to
this Section 5.10 at the request of Purchaser, during the term of this
Agreement, neither Seller nor the Company shall, without Purchaser's prior
written consent, which may be withheld in Purchaser's sole discretion, design,
construct, buildout or furnish the Sportsbook.

(b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, and upon Purchaser's
written request, and except as would reasonably be expected to adversely
impact the Business, Seller and the Company shall, and each shall cause its
Representatives to, (i) enter into on behalf of the Seller and the Company a
separate access agreement with Purchaser and, if requested by Purchaser,
Purchaser's Management Services Provider, granting Purchaser's and Purchaser's
Management Service Provider's Representatives such access to the Owned Real
Property, the Casino and Hotel and the Company's Representatives as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with the design (including site selection
within the Casino and Hotel), construction, buildout and furnishing of the
Sportsbook, including such access as is necessary to reasonably monitor the
actions and activities of the Company Contractors and Company Sportsbook
Buildout Partners; such access agreement shall include such other terms and
conditions as are reasonable and customary for access agreements that permit a
buyer and its representatives to enter a seller's real property for the
purposes contemplated by this Section 5.10; and (ii) provide such commercially
reasonable assistance as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser and
Purchaser's Management Service Provider and Purchaser's and Purchaser's
Management Service Provider's Representatives in connection with the design (including site selection) of
the Sportsbook provided, however, any costs incurred by Seller and the Company
in connection with the foregoing assistance that constitute Illinois
Sportsbook Capital Expenditures shall be subject to Purchaser's obligation to
reimburse Seller for such costs, as provided below. Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for the preparation of initial drafts of the Purchaser's
Sportsbook Plans and shall provide such initial drafts of the Purchaser's
Sportsbook Plans to Seller and the Company and shall reasonably consider such
revisions to Purchaser's Sportsbook Plans as Seller or the Company may
reasonably request within fifteen (15) Business Days of Seller's or the
Company's receipt of the drafts of Purchaser's Sportsbook Plans, provided,
however, Seller's prior written consent shall be required prior to the
approval of any Purchaser's Sportsbook Plans that would reasonably be expected
to adversely impact the Business. Following Purchaser's receipt of any
comments of Seller or the Company on the Purchaser's Sportsbook Plans pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence, Representatives of Seller, the Company
and Purchaser shall promptly meet to discuss any revisions to Purchaser's
Sportsbook Plans reasonably requested by Seller or the Company, and Purchaser
shall thereafter revise the Purchaser's Sportsbook Plans taking into account
the results of such meeting and provide revised versions of Purchaser's
Sportsbook Plans to Seller and the Company for their review and consideration,
which process shall repeat until such time as Purchaser's Sportsbook Plans are
substantially complete and acceptable to the parties (such Purchaser's
Sportsbook Plans, the "Final Plans"). To the extent required by applicable
Law, and upon the written request of Purchaser, Seller and the Company shall
each take such commercially reasonable actions as Purchaser may reasonably
request with respect to applying for and securing any required approvals of
any Gaming Authority or other Governmental Authority with respect to any
Permits, approvals, consents or licenses (other than the Illinois Sports
Betting Licenses) necessary for the design (including site selection within
the Casino and Hotel), construction, furnishing and operation of the Sportsbook
in accordance with the Final Plans, including the filing of such applications
and responding to any questions or comments that such Gaming Authority or
Governmental Authority may have in regards to the design (including site
selection within the Casino and Hotel), construction, furnishing and operation
of the Sportsbook.

(c) Unless prohibited from doing so by applicable Law, Purchaser, or any
Affiliate of Purchaser, may, at its election, engage a contractor or multiple
contractors (each, a "Purchaser Contractor" and together the "Purchaser
Contractors"), the selection of whom shall be subject to Seller's prior
written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
and such other third parties, the selection of whom shall be subject to
Seller's prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), as shall be necessary to provide services in connection with the
design, construction, buildout and furnishing of the Sportsbook (each, a
"Purchaser Sportsbook Buildout Party" and collectively, "Purchaser Sportsbook
Buildout Parties"). Purchaser may enter into such agreements with a Purchaser
Contractor and Purchaser Sportsbook Buildout Party as Purchaser shall
determine in its sole discretion (the "Purchaser Buildout Contracts");
provided Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
such agreements to include reasonable and customary indemnities for the
benefit of the Company and Seller for any Losses caused by such Purchaser
Sportsbook Buildout Parties, which indemnification provisions shall be subject
to Seller's reasonable prior written approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), provided further, if such agreements do not
include such indemnities for the benefit of the Company and Seller, Company
and Seller shall be entitled to draw on the Letter of Credit for reimbursement
of any Losses incurred by the Company or Seller and arising under the
Purchaser Buildout Contracts. The insurance provisions of any Purchaser Buildout Contracts entered into by
Purchaser shall also be subject to Seller's prior written approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and shall include, without
limitation, provisions requiring a Purchaser Contractor or any Purchaser
Sportsbook Buildout Party a party thereto to maintain commercially reasonable
levels of insurance customary for the services such Purchaser Contractor or
Purchaser Sportsbook Buildout Party is expected to provide pursuant to such
contract in connection with the design, construction, buildout and furnishing
of the Sportsbook, and such insurance policies shall name the Company as an
additional insured. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, and upon
Purchaser's written request, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, (i) enter into a separate access agreement with the
Purchaser Contractors and the Purchaser Sportsbook Buildout Parties granting
such parties such access to the Owned Real Property, the Casino and Hotel and
the Company's Representatives as shall be reasonably necessary in connection
with the design, construction, buildout and furnishing of the Sportsbook; such
access agreement shall include such other terms and conditions as are
reasonable and customary to permit a buyers representatives to enter a
seller's property to perform the services and activities contemplated by the
Purchaser Buildout Contracts provided, such access provisions may instead be
included in the Purchaser Buildout Contracts, in which case such provisions
shall be subject to Seller's prior written approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (ii) provide Purchaser's Contractors
and Purchaser Sportsbook Buildout Parties such reasonable assistance as may be
requested thereby in connection with the design, construction and furnishing
of the Sportsbook, provided, however, in the event Seller or the Company
incurs any Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures in connection with the
foregoing assistance, such costs and expenses shall be subject to Purchaser's
obligation to reimburse Seller and the Company for such costs, as provided
below. Purchaser shall ensure that all Purchaser Buildout Contracts are
assignable to or assumable by Seller or the Company (at Seller's option), in
the event this Agreement terminates prior to Closing for any reason.

(d) Purchaser shall be required to engage the Purchaser Contractors or
Purchaser Sportsbook Buildout Parties (as reasonably approved by Seller),
provided however, in the event that (i) pursuant to applicable Law, Seller or
the Company is prohibited from permitting Purchaser to engage the contractors
or other third parties that are necessary to complete the design,
construction, buildout or furnishing of the Sportsbook, upon Purchaser's
request, or (ii) Purchaser determines that, based on the written advice of its
tax advisors, Purchaser may be ineligible to receive the Privilege Tax Credit
as a result of directly engaging the Purchaser's Contractors or Purchaser's
Sportsbook Buildout Party in accordance with subsection (c) above, the Company
shall, upon Purchaser's written request, engage a contractor or contractors
selected by Purchaser and reasonably approved by Seller (each, a "Company
Contractor" and together, the "Company Contractors") and such other third
parties selected by Purchaser and reasonably approved by Seller, as shall be
necessary to provide services in connection with the design, construction,
buildout and furnishing of the Sportsbook (each, a "Company Sportsbook
Buildout Party" and collectively, the "Company Sportsbook Buildout Parties").
Upon Purchaser's written request, Seller and the Company shall enter into such
agreements (the "Company Buildout Contracts") with the Company Contractors and
Company Sportsbook Buildout Parties as the Company Contractors and Company
Sportsbook Buildout Parties shall reasonably request in connection with the
design, construction, buildout and furnishing of the Sportsbook; provided all
such agreements shall be subject to Seller's prior written approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and shall include the indemnity
(or Letter of Credit) and insurance provisions required for direct Purchaser Buildout Contracts in Section 5.10(c). Subject to the
preceding sentence, any Company Buildout Contracts entered into by the Company
shall be approved in advance by Purchaser and shall include therein such terms
and conditions as Purchaser shall reasonably request, including customary
representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities, in regards to the
services to be provided pursuant to such Customer Buildout Contracts. To the
extent not prohibited by applicable Law, and upon Purchaser's written request,
Seller and the Company shall, and each shall cause its Representatives to, (x)
enter into a separate access agreement with the Company Contractors and the
Company Sportsbook Buildout Parties granting such parties such access to the
Owned Real Property, the Casino and Hotel and the Company's Representatives as
shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the design, construction,
buildout and furnishing of the Sportsbook; such access agreement shall include
such other terms and conditions as are customary for access agreements that
permit a contractor's representatives to enter property of a customer to
perform the services customarily provided by such party; provided such access
provisions may be included in the Company Buildout Contracts; and (y) provide
the Company Contractors and the Company Sportsbook Buildout Parties such
reasonable assistance as may be requested thereby in connection with the
design, construction and furnishing of the Sportsbook; provided, however, in
the event Seller or the Company incurs any Illinois Sportsbook Capital
Expenditures in connection with the foregoing assistance, such costs and
expenses shall be subject to Purchaser's obligation to reimburse Seller for
such costs, as provided below. Neither Seller nor the Company nor any of
Seller's or the Company's Representatives shall grant any approvals or
consents under Company Buildout Contracts without Purchaser's prior written
consent, and the Company shall provide the Company Contractors and Company
Sportsbook Buildout Parties with any reasonable written instructions that
Purchaser may request in writing.

(e) As a condition to any of Seller's or the Company's obligations pursuant to
this Section 5.10 (other than pursuant to Section 5.10(b)), Purchaser shall
provide evidence of the amount and effectiveness of the Letter of Credit to
Seller (and continue to do so on a monthly basis). Purchaser shall also notify
Seller promptly upon any change in the effectiveness, amount or terms of the
Letter of Credit. If at any time the total amount of the Letter of Credit is
less than $2,000,000, Purchaser shall increase the amount of the Letter of
Credit, as applicable, to the required amount within five Business Days
following written notice from Seller.

(f) Purchaser shall be directly responsible for any Illinois Sports Betting
Capital Expenditures billed by the Purchaser Contractors or the Purchaser
Sportsbook Buildout Parties and shall reimburse Seller or the Company for any
Illinois Sports Betting Capital Expenditures billed to Seller or the Company
by the Company Contractors or the Company Sportsbook Buildout Parties and paid
by Seller or the Company, or otherwise incurred by Seller or any Acquired
Company in connection with the design, construction, buildout and furnishing
of the Sportsbook, including pursuant to any Company Buildout Contracts. To
the extent that Seller or the Company receives an invoice from any Purchaser
Contractor or Purchaser Sportsbook Buildout Party, or other party engaged by
Purchaser related to the design, construction, buildout or furnishing of the
Sportsbook in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.10, the Company
shall promptly forward such invoice to Purchaser and Purchaser shall be
responsible for the payment of any Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures
reflected in such invoice. Upon Purchaser's receipt of each such invoice,
Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event no later than the date such invoice
is due) pay directly to the Purchaser Contractor or Purchaser Sportsbook
Buildout Party, issuing the invoice all amounts of Illinois Sportsbook Capital
Expenditures, not then being disputed in good faith by Purchaser, set forth on such invoices,
and Purchaser shall provide to Seller evidence reasonably promptly of any such
invoice payments. To the extent that Seller or the Company receives an invoice
from a Company Contractor or Company Sportsbook Buildout Party or other party
engaged by Seller or the Company at the written direction of Purchaser related
to the design, construction, buildout or furnishing of the Sportsbook in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.10, the Company shall
promptly forward such invoice to Purchaser and, if not reasonably objected to
in writing by Purchaser prior to the fifth Business Day prior to the due date
of such invoice, the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than the
due date of such invoice, pay such invoice. To the extent that Seller or the
Company pays any invoice evidencing a Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditure
invoiced to Seller or the Company by any Company Contractor, Company
Sportsbook Buildout Party or other party engaged by Seller or the Company at
the written direction of Purchaser related to the design, construction,
buildout or furnishing of the Sportsbook in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 5.10, the Company shall promptly forward evidence of such payment
to Purchaser and Purchaser shall promptly, but in no event later than ten (10)
days after Purchaser's receipt of such evidence, reimburse Seller for any
amount of Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures paid directly by Seller or
the Company in satisfaction of such invoice. In the event Purchaser has not
reimbursed Seller for such amounts paid by Seller or the Company within ten
(10) days of Purchaser's receipt of such evidence, Seller or the Company may
draw on the Letter of Credit for such amounts paid. Any of the foregoing
amounts of Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures not so paid by Purchaser
or reimbursed to the Seller or Company prior to Closing shall be paid at
Closing (and for the avoidance of doubt, shall be neither credited towards the
Purchase Price nor considered an adjustment of the Purchase Price). In all
events, Purchaser shall take all such actions as are necessary to keep the
Owned Real Property, the Improvements and the Business free from Encumbrances
(x) in any way related to the work contemplated by this Section 5.10 and
performed at the request or direction of Purchaser, and/or (y) arising out of
the acts of Purchaser, Purchaser's Management Services Provider or Purchaser's
or Purchaser's Management Services Provider's Representatives in connection
with the work contemplated by this Section 5.10; including, without
limitation, in each such case, posting a bond sufficient to cover the cost of
any invoice that Purchaser is disputing. Purchaser shall be entitled to elect
not to renew the Letter of Credit or request that the Company and Seller
cancel the Letter of Credit, in which case the Company and Seller will return
the original Letter of Credit to the issuer of the Letter of Credit and
execute such other documentation as may be required by the issuer of the
Letter of Credit in order to cancel the Letter of Credit upon the earlier of
(A) the Closing and (B) thirty (30) days following the termination of this
Agreement.

(g) In the event that Purchaser breaches in any material respect its
obligations under this Section 5.10, Seller may deliver to Purchaser a notice
outlining in reasonable detail such breach (such notice a "Sportsbook Default
Notice"). Subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 5.10(f), in the event
Purchaser has not cured such breach within thirty (30) days, following the
date Purchaser receives the Sportsbook Default Notice (provided, with respect
to non-monetary breaches that cannot be cured during such thirty (30) day
period, if Purchaser has commenced to cure such breach within such thirty (30)
day period, such period shall be extended for the period not to exceed a total
of 30 days that Purchaser is diligently pursuing a cure), Seller may (but
shall not be obligated to) stop the design, construction and furnishing of the
Sportsbook, and may (but shall not be obligated) re-commence the design,
construction and furnishing of the Sportsbook with replacement Company
Contractors and Company Buildout Parties of its choosing, and Purchaser shall be responsible (and Seller may draw on the Letter of Credit)
for all Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures reasonably incurred by Seller
or the Company in connection with the design, construction and furnishing of
the Sportsbook in accordance with the Final Plans following Purchaser's
failure to cure such breach.

(h) Privilege Tax Credit.

(i) Parent, Seller, each Acquired Company and Purchaser acknowledge that (A)
after June 30, 2020, the Illinois Gambling Act (the "IGA") imposes a privilege
tax (the "Privilege Tax") on persons engaged in the business of conducting
gambling operations in Illinois based upon the adjusted gross receipts
received by a licensee (as defined in the IGA) from gambling games authorized
under the IGA, (B) the IGA provides a dollar-for-dollar credit (the "Privilege
Tax Credit") against the Privilege Tax for renovation or construction costs
paid by an "owners licensee," as defined in the IGA, after June 27, 2019 and
on or before June 30, 2023 provided certain requirements specified in the IGA
(the "Qualification Requirements") are satisfied, (C) the Privilege Tax
Credits are subject to certain limitations and adjustments as provided in the
IGA (the "Credit Limitations"), (D) none of Parent, Seller or any Acquired
Company has incurred any renovation or construction costs that would support
Privilege Tax Credits between June 27, 2019 and the date hereof, and (E)
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller or an Acquired Company
may incur certain renovation and construction costs that will be funded or
reimbursed by Purchaser and which may also support Privilege Tax Credits.

(ii) Parent, Seller and, prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies
agree not to claim any Privilege Tax Credit with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Rather, Privilege Tax Credits shall accrue for the benefit of
Purchaser or, after the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies as appropriate,
subject to any applicable Qualification Requirements and Credit Limitations.
Notwithstanding the two preceding sentences, Parent, Seller, each Acquired
Company and Purchaser agree that (A) if, to avoid loss of the benefits of such
Privilege Tax Credits under the IGA or other applicable Law, Purchaser
determines that Parent, Seller or, prior to the Closing, an Acquired Company
must claim or otherwise apply for any Privilege Tax Credit, then if directed
in writing by Purchaser, Parent, Seller or an Acquired Company shall so claim
or otherwise apply for such Privilege Tax Credits, and (B) if, prior to the
Closing Date, Parent, Seller, or any Acquired Company actually realizes the
benefit of any such Privilege Tax Credits claimed or otherwise applied for
pursuant to Section 5.10(h)(ii)(A) (a "Pre-Closing Tax Credit Benefit"), the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to such Pre-Closing Tax
Credit Benefit. Parent, Seller, each Acquired Company and Purchaser agree and
acknowledge that (X) Parent, Seller and each Acquired Company shall file
claims for, or otherwise apply for, Privilege Tax Credits only as directed by
Purchaser, it being specifically understood that Purchaser is responsible for
determining qualification for the Privilege Tax Credits of expenses incurred
by Seller or Acquired Company, including satisfaction of the Qualification
Requirements and application of the Credit Limitations, (Y) none of Parent,
Seller, or, prior to the Closing, any Acquired Company shall be required to
file any privilege tax return or related filing or claim any Privilege Tax
Credit in any manner inconsistent with the IGA or other applicable Law, and
(Z) Purchaser shall indemnify Parent and Seller for Losses incurred by them as
a result of their compliance with the provisions of Section 5.10(g)(ii)(A),
including, for avoidance of doubt, any taxes, interest, penalties or other
costs resulting from an audit or assessment of Privilege Tax by the applicable Governmental Authority that administers and collects the Privilege Taxes and
Privilege Tax Credits.

(iii) Except as specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of
Parent, Seller, prior to the Closing, any Acquired Company, and Purchaser
agree and acknowledge that none of Parent, Seller or, prior to the Closing
Date, any Acquired Company shall have any responsibility with respect to (A)
the determination of, or the satisfaction of, any of the Qualification
Requirements with respect to Privilege Tax Credits, (B) the determination of,
or application of, the Credit Limitations with respect to Privilege Tax
Credits, or (C) any compliance requirement or document filing obligation
related to the claiming of, or entitlement to, the benefit of any Privilege
Tax Credit, except to the limited extent provided in Section 5.10(h)(ii)(A).
Seller and Purchaser further agree that none of Parent, Seller or any Acquired
Company shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold Purchaser
harmless in the event that any potential Privilege Tax Credits are for any
reason disallowed by the applicable Governmental Authority that administers
and collects the Privilege Taxes and Privilege Tax Credits or otherwise not
available to Purchaser or any Acquired Company for any pre-Closing or post-
Closing tax period other than as a result of Parent, Seller or any Acquired
Company claiming any or otherwise applying for any Privilege Tax Credits in
violation of the terms of this Agreement.

(iv) In the event that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated, any Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures for which Purchaser
is obligated to reimburse or otherwise pay to Parent, Seller or any Acquired
Company pursuant to this Agreement and that have not been so reimbursed or
paid as of the date of the termination of this Agreement (the "Unreimbursed
Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures") shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis, by an amount equal to the amount of any Privilege Tax Credit
actually realized by Parent, Seller or any Acquired Company as of the date of
such termination (the "Tax Credit Offset Amount").

(v) In the event that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated, Seller and the Acquired Companies shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to Purchaser, in accordance with the requirements of this Section 5.10(h)(v),
an amount equal to the Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures paid or
reimbursed by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement prior to the termination of
this Agreement (including any amounts paid to Seller or the Company or drawn
upon thereby pursuant to the Letter of Credit) (such previously paid Illinois
Sportsbook Capital Expenditures, the "Previously Paid Illinois Sportsbook
Capital Expenditures") for which Parent, Seller or an Acquired Company has
realized a Privilege Tax Credit as of the date of termination of this
Agreement (the "Previously Paid Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditure
Termination Date Realized Amount").

(vi) Not later than five (5) Business Days following the termination of this
Agreement, Seller and the Acquired Companies shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account(s)
designated in writing by Purchaser, an amount equal to the Previously Paid
Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditure Termination Date Realized Amount.

(vii) In the event that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
not consummated, Seller and the Acquired Companies shall use commercially efforts to apply for the Privilege Tax Credits with respect to any of the
Unreimbursed Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures and Previously Paid
Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures for which Parent, Seller or an
Acquired Company has not realized a Privilege Tax Credit as of the date of
termination of this Agreement (the "Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditure
Unrealized Amounts"). In the event the Parent, Seller or the Acquired
Companies subsequently realize Privilege Tax Credits with respect to any
Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditure Unrealized Amounts (such Tax Credit,
the "Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditure Post-Termination Date Realized
Amount", and, together with the Tax Credit Offset Amount and the Previously
Paid Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditure Termination Date Realized Amount,
collectively, the "Tax Credit Repayment Amounts"), then Seller or the Acquired
Companies, as applicable, shall promptly pay to Purchaser an amount equal to
such Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditure Post-Termination Date Realized
Amount, provided that such amount shall not exceed $2,000,000. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, after the termination of this Agreement,
Seller and the Acquired Companies shall only be obligated to pay Purchaser for
Privilege Tax Credits related to funds actually paid or reimbursed by
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (including any amounts paid to Seller or
the Company or drawn upon thereby pursuant to the Letter of Credit).

(viii) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the sum of the Tax Credit
Repayment Amount paid by Seller and the Acquired Companies to Purchaser exceed
the amount of Illinois Sportsbook Capital Expenditures paid or reimbursed by
Purchaser (including any amounts paid to Seller and the Acquired Companies or
drawn upon thereby pursuant to the Letter of Credit) and in no event shall the
sum of the Tax Credit Repayment Amount paid by Seller or the Company to
Purchaser exceed $2,000,000.

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing shall not be conditioned (or
delayed) upon the commencement or completion of the Sportsbook or the
application for or approval of the Privilege Tax Credit. For the avoidance of
doubt, the obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 5.10 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the Closing.

5.11 Tax Matters.

(a) Indemnification. Seller will indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties harmless against any and all Losses which a Purchaser Indemnified
Party suffers or incurs, insofar as such Losses are paid or incurred in
connection with, arise out of or result from (i) all Taxes imposed on the
Acquired Companies, or for which an Acquired Company may otherwise be liable,
for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and,
with respect to any Straddle Tax Period, the portion of such Straddle Tax
Period ending on and including the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"),
including, for avoidance of doubt, any payroll taxes owed by or with respect
to any Acquired Company that are due or paid after the Closing Date to the
extent such payroll taxes relate to taxable periods, or portions thereof,
ending on or prior to the Closing Date and the payment of which was deferred
pursuant to Section 2302(a)(1) of the CARES Act; provided however that the
Seller shall retain the tax benefits of any employee retention credits
provided for pursuant to Section 2301(a) of the CARES Act that have not been
claimed or the benefit received as of the Closing Date and which employee
retention credits relate to taxable periods ending or prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) all Taxes of Seller for any taxable period, (iii) all Taxes imposed
(A) on the Acquired Companies, or for which an Acquired Company may otherwise
be liable, as a result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 on or prior to the
Closing Date, or (B) as a result of transferee or successor liability or joint
and several liability, by Contract or otherwise relating to an event,
occurrence or agreement at or prior to the Closing, and (iv) all Transfer
Taxes for which the Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 5.11(b);
provided, however, that Seller shall not be liable for or pay, and shall not
indemnify or hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties against, the
amount of any such Taxes taken into account in the Actual Working Capital or
Actual Transaction Costs. For purposes of the foregoing and for purposes of
the determination of Working Capital, the determination of the Taxes of the
Acquired Companies for the portion of the Straddle Tax Period ending on and
including the Closing Date shall be determined as follows: (i) in the case of
any real property, personal property and other similar ad valorem Tax, such
Tax shall be equal to the total amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Tax Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Tax Period that are in the period ending on the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar
days in the Straddle Tax Period; and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, on a
closing-of-the-books basis by assuming that the Straddle Tax Period consisted
of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing
Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date.

(b) Transfer Taxes. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear 50% of any real
property transfer Tax, sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, unit transfer Tax, and
other similar Taxes imposed on the Contemplated Transactions ("Transfer
Taxes"). Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to prepare and timely
file any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes.

(c) Tax Returns.

(i) Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Acquired
Companies on or prior to the Closing Date. In each case Seller shall remit or
cause to be paid to the applicable Governmental Authority any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns. All Tax Returns that Seller is required to file
or cause to be filed in accordance with this Section 5.11(c)(i) shall be
prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax
Returns, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business or as required by
applicable Tax Law, no position shall be taken, election made or method
adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods
used in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods.

(ii) Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Companies with respect to any
Straddle Tax Period and any Tax Return that is required to be filed by or with
respect to the Acquired Companies for taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date (taking into account
extensions of time to file). All Tax Returns that Purchaser is required to
file or cause to be filed in accordance with this Section 5.11(c)(ii) shall be
prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax
Returns, other than as required by applicable Tax Law, no position shall be
taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions
taken, elections made or methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax
Returns in prior periods. Such Tax Returns prepared by Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 5.11(c)(ii) shall be provided to Seller not less than twenty (20)
days (or such lesser time as the circumstances require, but in any event, not
less than (10) days) prior to the due date for timely filing such Tax returns and comment. Purchaser shall accept and incorporate into such Tax Returns all
reasonable comments provided by Seller; provided that, in no event shall
Purchaser be required to incorporate any comments from Seller if Purchaser and
Seller reasonably determine that Seller's position is not supportable on a
"more likely than not" basis. The provisions of Section 2.4(d) shall apply if
Purchase and Seller cannot agree regarding whether a position is supportable
on a more likely than not basis.

(iii) Seller shall remit to Purchaser the Taxes for which Seller is liable
pursuant to this Section 5.11 in respect of any Tax Return to be filed by
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.11(a) at least five (5) days prior to the
due date for such Tax Return. For the avoidance of doubt, such payment
obligations shall not be subject to the limitations on indemnification set
forth in Section 7.3.

(d) Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, each of Seller and
Purchaser, upon reasonable request, shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) provide to the other reasonable cooperation and assistance in
connection with:

(i) signing and delivering such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in Section 5.11(b)
(relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes);

(ii) the preparation of any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible
for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 5.11(c);

(iii) preparing for and defending audits of, or disputes with any Governmental
Authority regarding, any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies;

(iv) making available information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of
the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; and

(v) furnishing the other with copies of correspondence received from any
Governmental Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request
with respect to any such taxable period.

(e) Survival, etc. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including Article VII), the obligations of the parties set forth in this
Section 5.11 shall survive the Closing until the date that is sixty (60) days
after the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations (including any
extensions thereof); provided, however, that if, at any time on or prior to
the expiration date referred to in this sentence, any Purchaser Indemnified
Party notifies Seller of a claim for recovery under this Section 5.11, then
the claim asserted in such notice shall survive until such time as such claim
is fully and finally resolved. No claim made pursuant to this Section 5.11
shall be subject to the limitations in Section 7.3.

(f) Contest Provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (including Article VII): (i) Purchaser will promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by the
Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or, after the Closing Date, an Acquired
Company of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits, inquiries or
assessments, or other legal proceedings relating to Taxes of an Acquired
Company for which Purchaser or its Affiliate may be entitled to
indemnification under Section 5.11 (a "Tax Contest Claim"); provided, however,
that the failure or delay by Purchaser to promptly provide notice of a Tax
Contest Claim will not affect Purchaser's right to indemnification hereunder
except to the extent that Seller clearly demonstrates that its defense of such
Tax Contest Claim is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice will include a
copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the relevant
Governmental Authority.

(ii) Seller will have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Contest
Claim which relates solely to one or more taxable periods that end on or
before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of Seller's choice at its own
cost; provided, however, that (A) Seller will keep Purchaser informed, on a
reasonably prompt basis, regarding the progress and substantive aspects of any
such Tax Contest Claim and will provide Purchaser with copies of any
correspondence to or from the applicable taxing authority, and (B) Seller will
not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest Claim without obtaining
Purchaser's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such compromise or settlement could
reasonably be expected to increase the Taxes of Purchaser or any Acquired
Company for any taxable period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date
(ignoring for this purpose any immaterial increases in Taxes). If Seller does
not timely control the conduct of a Tax Contest Claim pursuant to this Section
5.11(f)(ii), then Purchaser will keep Seller reasonably informed regarding the
progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest Claim and Purchaser will
not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest Claim in a manner that would
result in additional Liability of Seller for Taxes without obtaining Seller's
prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(iii) Seller and Purchaser shall be entitled to jointly control the conduct of
any Tax Contest Claim which relates to any Straddle Tax Period, and in
connection therewith, each of Seller and Purchaser shall be entitled to employ
counsel of its choice at its own cost. To the extent that Seller and Purchaser
assume joint control of any such Tax Contest Claim, neither Seller nor
Purchaser will compromise or settle such Tax Contest Claim without obtaining
the other party's prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Seller does not timely
assume joint control of the conduct of a Tax Contest Claim pursuant to this
Section 5.11(f)(iii), then Purchaser will control the conduct of such Tax
Contest Claim and will keep Seller reasonably informed regarding the progress
and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest Claim and Purchaser will not
compromise or settle any such Tax Contest Claim in a manner that could be
reasonably expected to result in additional Liability of Seller for Taxes
without obtaining Seller's prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(g) Tax Refunds. Except to the extent taken into account in Actual Working
Capital, any refund of Taxes of an Acquired Company, or any amounts credited
against such Taxes, (including any interest actually received or credited with
respect thereto) attributable (or treated as attributable) to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be the property of Seller, and shall be paid promptly by the
Company or Purchaser upon receipt to or at the direction of Seller or its
Affiliates. (h) Purchase Tax Acts. Except as required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
each Acquired Company) not to, (i) file any amended Tax Return with respect to
any Acquired Company that relates to or impacts any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(ii) make, revoke or amend any Tax election, change any accounting period, or
change any Tax accounting method with respect to any Acquired Company to the
extent that such action would have retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, or (iii) initiate any voluntary disclosure agreement or similar
agreement with any Governmental Authority with respect to any Tax or Tax
Return of any Acquired Company.

5.12 Director and Officer Liability.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Acquired Companies to, reimburse, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were directors or
officers of the Acquired Companies (collectively, the "DandO Indemnitees") with
respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken
at the request of any such Acquired Company at any time prior to the Closing
Date, but, in each case, solely to the same extent that such DandO Indemnitees
were entitled to indemnification as of immediately prior to the Closing
pursuant to the Charter Documents of the Acquired Companies or any
indemnification agreement between an Acquired Company and the DandO Indemnitee,
in each case, as in existence on the date hereof with, or for the benefit of,
any such DandO Indemnitees for matters occurring on or prior to the Closing.
Purchaser agrees that all rights of the DandO Indemnitees to indemnification and
exculpation from Liabilities for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Closing Date as provided in the respective Charter Documents of the Acquired
Companies as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements
of the Acquired Companies in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the
Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date. During
such six (6) year period, such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the DandO
Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In addition,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to, pay any expenses of
any DandO Indemnitee under this Section 5.12, as incurred to the fullest extent
such DandO Indemnitee has the right to advancement of expenses as of the date
hereof, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by applicable Law.

(b) On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall purchase, on behalf of the
Acquired Companies, a prepaid, extended reporting period endorsement under the
Acquired Companies' existing directors and officers liability insurance, which
insurance shall provide coverage for the DandO Indemnitees for a period of six
(6) years immediately following the Closing and shall be no less favorable
than the coverage provided by the policy or policies applicable to the
Acquired Companies and maintained by Seller or the Acquired Companies
immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of such individuals (the "DandO
Tail"). Seller and Purchaser shall split evenly the aggregate amount of all
premiums due in connection with the DandO Tail (the "DandO Tail Premium").

(c) In the event that Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser shall assume all of
the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.12. The obligations of
Purchaser under this Section 5.12 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.12
applies without the consent of the affected DandO Indemnitee (it being expressly
agreed that the DandO Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.12 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.12).

5.13 Release.

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by Law, Seller
(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and each of its and its Affiliates'
respective past, present and future Representatives, general or limited

dividends or other payments arising out of or related to Seller's acquisition
or ownership of the Shares and, following the Conversions, the Purchased
Interests); provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 5.13(a)
shall operate to release any Purchaser Releasee for any claims arising under,
or related to, this Agreement or any Related Agreement, but subject in every
respect to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. Seller hereby
irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any
claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced, any
Proceeding of any kind against any Purchaser Releasee, based upon any matter
purported to be released hereby.

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by Law,

equity, whether known or unknown, against the respective Seller Releasees

each case, with respect to such Seller Releasee's management, ownership or
operation of the Acquired Companies (including rental payments, accrued and
unpaid dividends or other payments arising out of or related to Seller's acquisition or ownership of the Shares
and, following the Conversions, the Purchased Interests); provided, however,
that nothing contained in this Section 5.13(b) shall operate to release any
Seller Releasee for any claims arising under, or related to, this Agreement or
any Related Agreement, but subject in every respect to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement. Purchaser hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain
from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing,
instituting or causing to be commenced, any Proceeding of any kind against any
Seller Releasee, based upon any matter purported to be released hereby.

5.14 Termination of Related Party Contracts and Settlement of Intercompany
Accounts.

(a) Except for the Contracts set forth on Schedule 5.14(a), the Acquired
Companies and Seller shall, and Seller shall cause the Acquired Companies and
their respective Affiliates to, take such actions as may be necessary such
that, as of the Closing, all Contracts between any Acquired Company, on the
one hand, and a Related Party, on the other hand, including any Tax sharing
agreements, shall be terminated and of no further continued force or effect
and no further rights or other obligations or liabilities on the part of any
party thereto will continue.

Company, on the one hand, and a Related Party, on the other hand, are settled
at or prior to the Closing.

5.15 Confidentiality; Noncompete; Nonsolicitation.

(a) In recognition of the fact that Parent, Seller and their Affiliates are
receiving significant economic value under this Agreement, and in furtherance
of the sale of the Purchased Interests and the Business to Purchaser hereunder
by virtue of the Contemplated Transactions and more effectively to protect the
value and goodwill of the Business so sold, Parent and Seller hereby agree to
the following restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 5.15 (and
acknowledge that Purchaser would be irreparably damaged if Parent, Seller or
any of their Affiliates were to violate any restrictive covenants set forth in
this Section 5.15):

(i) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, keep confidential with same
degree of care Seller takes to protect its own Confidential Information (but
in no event with less than commercially reasonably degree of care) all
information exclusively relating to the Acquired Companies and their business,
except (x) to the extent legally permissible, in connection with any action to
enforce this Agreement, (y) with respect to financial information of the
Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries for pre-Closing periods for use in
connection with Seller's or its Affiliates' financial reporting activities or
(z) to the extent such information is requested or required by applicable Law
or regulation or by deposition, interrogatories, requests for information or
documents in legal or administrative proceedings, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or other similar legal process, in which case the Seller
shall (i) provide Purchaser with prompt written notice to the extent not
legally prohibited of the existence, terms and circumstances of any such
request or requirement so that the Acquired Companies may seek (at their own cost and expense) a protective order
or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 5.15(a)(i); (ii) disclose only that portion of the information which
outside counsel advises the Seller is legally required to be disclosed; and
(iii) exercise (and cause its Representatives to exercise) commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the information;
provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its Representatives
may disclose any information to any Governmental Authority the extent
requested or required in connection with a routine audit or examination by any
tax or regulatory authority having jurisdiction over Seller or its
Representatives.

(ii) At the Closing, Seller and the Company each shall take such actions as
shall be necessary for the Company to have exclusive access to the Player List
and the information contained therein, other than the Common Information. In
addition, at the Closing, unless prohibited from doing so by applicable Law,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to purge from its and its
Affiliates' records, including the Customer Database, the Seller's and the
Company's and each of their Affiliates' central reservation systems (including
Sabre) and e-mail marketing systems (including iPost) and any other electronic
records, the Central Information (as defined herein) and the Player List and
any information included in the Player List other than the Common Information.
To the extent that Seller or its Affiliates are prohibited by applicable Law
from purging from its records the Central Information or the Player List or
the information contained therein, from and after the Closing, neither Parent
nor Seller shall use, and each shall cause its Affiliates and its and its
Affiliates' Representatives not to use, the Central Information or the Player
List or any information included in the Player List for any purpose other than
as is necessary to ensure compliance with applicable Laws or to defend or
prosecute actual or potential litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein will restrict Seller or its Affiliates' right to use the Common
Information other than Common Information that constitutes Central
Information.

(iii) From and after two days following the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Closing (the "Interim Period") Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates with access to the Player List to, restrict access to the Player
List to those individuals that are exclusively employees of the Company
responsible for the Company's marketing activities and such other employees of
the Company that are exclusively employees of the Company and that require
access to such information to perform their duties in a manner consistent with
past practice, and will use its reasonable best efforts to block continuing
access or destroy tangible and intangible copies of the Player List otherwise
available to parties not so restricted. During the Interim Period, the
information included in the Player List (other than Common Information) shall
be utilized only by the Company in connection with the operation of its
Business and shall not be made available to or utilized by any Affiliate of
Seller (other than the Company) or any Representative of Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller other than a Person that is exclusively an employee of the
Company and that may have access to such information pursuant to this Section
5.15(a)(iii). In addition, during the Interim Period, none of Parent, Seller
or any Affiliate thereof (excluding any Acquired Company) shall extract, copy,
mine or otherwise retrieve or migrate any Central Information contained in any
central reservation systems (including Sabre), e-mail marketing systems
(including iPost) or other database (including a repository of recorded phone
calls) maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates. (iv) From and after the Closing until the date three (3) years after the
Closing Date, each of Parent and Seller shall not and each shall cause its
respective Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives (the
"Restricted Parties") not to:

(A) (1) solicit or target customers or players on the Player List; (2) use the
Player List or any information (other than Common Information) included
therein (if the Player List or such other information may not be purged
pursuant to Section 5.15(a)(ii)), whether such information is otherwise
included in any records (including the Customer Database or any other
electronic records) maintained by Parent, Seller or any of their Affiliates,
to make any direct marketing or general advertising to the customers on the
Player List for (w) any property located within a seventy-five (75)-mile
radius of the Casino and Hotel (the "Restricted Area") or (x) any online,
mobile, or web-based wagering or gaming activities (including sports wagering)
within the State of Illinois; or (3) sell, license or otherwise permit any
Person to use the Player List or any information included therein (if the
Player List or such other information may not be purged pursuant to Section
5.15(a)(ii)) to make any direct marketing or general advertising to the
customers on the Player List, provided, however, notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Parent and its Subsidiaries may: (1) without use of
the information on the Player List (other than the Common Information) or
information including, without limitation, contact information contained in
any central reservation system or other database maintained by Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than an Acquired Company) that was obtained as a
result of a customer of the Company redeeming a marketing offer for the Casino
and Hotel or making a reservation for a stay at the Casino and Hotel (the "Central
Information"), engage in general solicitations and marketing which are not
directed to or targeted at the customers on the Player List, and (2) without
use of the information included in the Player List (other than Common
Information) and the Central Information, and so long as the obligations of
Seller and its Affiliates set forth in Section 5.15(a)(ii) and (iii) have been
complied with, continue to engage in direct marketing with respect to
Parent\'s and its Subsidiaries' physical casino properties located outside the
Restricted Area, its licensed video gaming terminal operations, its social
gaming businesses and its non-gambling or wagering businesses or properties to
any customers: (y) who have prior to the Closing gambled or wagered at any
such other physical casino properties or on its social gaming applications, or
(z) who have voluntarily signed up for any of Parent\'s or its Affiliates'
(other than the Company's) players or other customer lists or social gaming
applications; provided, however, that none of Parent, Seller or any Affiliate
thereof (including any Acquired Company) shall offer any bonus or other direct
inducement to customers of the Casino and Hotel to sign up for such customer
lists or social gaming applications; or

(B) own, operate, lease, manage, control, engage in, invest in, act as
consultant or advisor to, or render a service that is utilized primarily for
the operation of a sports book, slot machines, table games or pari-mutuel
wagering (in each case whether alone or in association with any Person) at a
physical facility located within the Restricted Area; provided, however, for
the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set forth in this Section
5.15(a)(iv)(B) shall not include online sports betting, licensed video gaming
terminal operations, social casinos, gaming applications (including mobile,
internet, and other web-based gaming products), or providing sports betting
services to any third party outside the State of Illinois.

(v) From and after the Closing until the date three (3) years after the
Closing Date, each of Parent and Seller shall not and each shall cause its
respective Affiliates not to directly or indirectly through another Person (including the Restricted
Parties) (i) encourage, induce, solicit or attempt to encourage, induce or
solicit any Continuing Employees to leave the employ of an Acquired Company or
any Affiliate of an Acquired Company; or (ii) hire or employ any Continuing
Employee or any person who was a key employee of an Acquired Company at any
time during the three (3) month period immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not
prohibit any solicitation or employment of any such employee pursuant to or as
a result of or with respect to (x) any public advertisement or posting or
other form of general solicitation that is not directed at such employees or
search firms not requested by Parent, Seller or any of their Affiliates to
target such employees, (y) any employee who has not been employed by an
Acquired Company or its Affiliates for at least six months (provided such
employee had not been solicited by Parent or Seller or any of their Affiliates
prior to the six-month period following his or her termination of employment),
and (z) any employee who has been terminated by an Acquired Company or its
Affiliates.

(b) The parties agree that the covenants set forth in this Section 5.15 are
reasonable with respect to duration, geographical area and scope. It is the
intent and understanding of each party hereto that if, in any action before
any court or agency legally empowered to enforce this Section 5.15, any term,
restriction, covenant or promise in this Section 5.15 is found to be
unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such term, restriction,
covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make
it enforceable by such court or agency, and such court or agency shall be
empowered to reform the terms hereof (including by modifying or reducing the
duration, geographical area or scope hereof) or to delete specific words or
phrases included herein.

(c) Each of Parent and Seller acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the Contemplated Transactions and that the
agreements set forth in this Agreement are knowingly made in contemplation of
such benefits.

5.16 Insurance

. Following the Closing, with respect to any occurrence-based insurance policy
of Seller or its Affiliates under which an Acquired Company is an insured,
Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies, as applicable, may make claims
under such policies (to the extent of coverage and subject to any policy
limits under such policies, it being acknowledged and agreed that the Acquired
Companies shall be covered under such policies to the extent of coverage prior
to the Closing) with respect to events taking place prior to the Closing in
respect of the business and the operations and liabilities of the Acquired
Companies; provided, however, that Purchaser shall exclusively bear (and the
Seller shall have no obligation to repay or reimburse Purchaser for) the
amount of any "deductibles" associated with claims of the Acquired Companies
following Closing under such policies and shall be liable for all uninsured or
uncovered amounts of such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 5.16 is intended to modify or limit any of the Seller's
obligations, or any of the Purchaser's rights, under Article VII.

5.17 Filing Fees; Gaming Approvals.

(a) All filing fees required under the HSR Act shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Purchaser, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Seller, on the
other hand. (b) All fees related to Purchaser receiving Gaming Approvals required or
necessary in connection with the Contemplated Transactions and necessary for
ownership and operation of the Acquired Companies shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Purchaser, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Seller, on the
other hand.

5.18 Title Policy.

(a) Seller and the Acquired Companies shall reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser\'s efforts to cause the Title Company to issue either of the
following at Purchaser's election: (i) ALTA 2006 owner's policy of title
insurance, insuring the applicable Acquired Company's fee simple title to the
Owned Real Property in an amount reasonably determined by Purchaser, and
substantially in the form of the pro forma title policy or marked up title
commitment attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Pro Forma"), including a non-
imputation endorsement and such other endorsements as Purchaser may reasonably
request and that are reasonably obtainable from title companies in the State
of Illinois (the "Title Policy"), or (ii) an endorsement to Seller's Existing
Title Policies to update the effective date, provide fairway and non-
imputation coverage, and insure that title to the Owned Real Property is free
from all Encumbrances other than the exclusions from coverage contained in
such policies and the Permitted Title Exceptions (the "Title Endorsements");
provided, Purchaser represents that the Title Company has previously committed
to issue the Title Policy in substantially the form of the Pro Forma and/or
the Title Endorsements, prior to the date hereof, subject only to payment of
the premium therefor, and the actions required of Seller which are listed on
Schedule 5.18(a) hereto.

(b) If after the date hereof, any new matter is revealed by a title update or
survey update that is not a Permitted Title Exception and that would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the Owned Real
Property and the Acquired Companies' operation of the Casino and Hotel as then
currently operated, then Purchaser shall have the right to disapprove such new
matter by written notice to Seller within seven (7) Business Days after such
new matter is disclosed to Purchaser in writing. If Purchaser fails to notify
Seller of its disapproval of any such new matter within such seven (7)
Business Day period, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved such new
matter and such new matter shall be deemed to be a Permitted Title Exception.
If Purchaser timely disapproves such new matter, Seller shall remove such new
exception from title at Closing or, subject to Purchaser's approval, to obtain
affirmative coverage over such new exception from Title Company, and Seller
shall have the right to extend the Closing Date for such period as is
reasonably required, but in no event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day
prior to the Outside Date, to allow it to so remove or obtain affirmative
coverage over such new exception.

(c) At or before Closing, Seller shall either (i) cause any Monetary Liens to
be released of record, or (ii) cause the Title Company to insure over such
Monetary Liens (whether by payment, bond, indemnity, or otherwise), without
any additional cost to Purchaser, provided that such affirmative insurance
over any Monetary Lien shall be subject to Purchaser's prior written approval,
not to be unreasonably withheld. As used herein, "Monetary Liens" means
Encumbrances on title for judgment liens against Seller, mortgage or deed of
trust liens or mechanics' liens and any other monetary liens encumbering title
to the Owned Real Property that arise out of a contract entered into by, or
work performed on behalf of, Seller, but does not include Permitted Title
Exceptions or any Encumbrance arising out of the acts or omissions of
Purchaser or Persons acting by, through or under Purchaser. Seller may satisfy
any Monetary Lien at Closing so long as Seller delivers to Purchaser a Payoff Letter pursuant to Section
2.6(d) at Closing with respect to such Monetary Lien in recordable form
sufficient to cause such Monetary Lien to be released of record, together with
the costs of recording or filing such instruments. Seller shall pay all costs
associated with so discharging or removing any Monetary Liens.

(d) Seller shall only be obligated to pay for (i) the portion of the premium
for the Title Policy that is allocable to standard coverage and (ii) the Title
Endorsements (as applicable), in an aggregate amount up to the Title
Threshold, and Purchaser shall pay any portion of such premium and/or the
Title Endorsements that exceeds the Title Threshold. Purchaser shall pay the
cost of any new surveys or updates to Seller's Existing Survey, as well as the
portion of the premium for the Title Policy that is allocable to extended
coverage and any title endorsements to the Title Policy. All other costs and
expenses (if any) due upon closing of the Contemplated Transactions with
respect to the Owned Real Property shall be allocated between Purchaser and
the Seller in accordance with the customary practice of the county in which
any such Owned Real Property is located.

5.19 Casualty and Condemnation Proceeds.

(a) In the event that, during the period from the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
or the Closing, (i) there is any damage, destruction or other casualty
affecting the Owned Real Property or the Casino and Hotel, or any condemnation
or eminent domain proceeding is completed with respect thereto (each such
event, a "Casualty and Condemnation Event"), and (ii) Seller or the applicable
Acquired Company or any of their Affiliates receive any insurance proceeds
from such casualty, business interruption or governmental award in such
condemnation or eminent domain proceeding (in either case, "Casualty and
Condemnation Proceeds"), then (A) if such Acquired Company receives the
Casualty and Condemnation Proceeds, such Acquired Company shall retain such
Casualty and Condemnation Proceeds and may not distribute or pay over such
Casualty and Condemnation Proceeds to Seller or any Affiliate of Seller but
shall be permitted to use such proceeds to make such repairs as Seller
reasonably deems necessary to return the Owned Real Property or the Casino and
Hotel, as applicable, to at least substantially the same condition it was in
prior to the Casualty or Condemnation Event or as required by any such
governmental award or business interruption insurance, (B) if Seller or any of
its Affiliates receives the Casualty and Condemnation Proceeds during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Closing, Seller shall or
shall cause its Affiliates to contribute such Casualty and Condemnation
Proceeds (net of legal expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
pursuing the proceeds or award) to the applicable Acquired Company prior to
the Closing, and such Acquired Company shall be permitted to use such proceeds
to make such repairs as Seller reasonably deems necessary to return the Owned
Real Property or the Casino and Hotel, as applicable, to at least the
substantially same condition it was in prior to the Casualty or Condemnation
Event or as required by any such governmental award or business interruption
insurance, and (C) if Seller or any of its Affiliates receives the Casualty
and Condemnation Proceeds after the Closing, Seller shall or shall cause its
Affiliates to promptly deliver such Casualty and Condemnation Proceeds (net of
legal expenses reasonably incurred in connection with pursuing the proceeds or
award) to the applicable Acquired Company. For the avoidance of doubt,
"Casualty and Condemnation Proceeds" shall not include any amounts paid or the Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing related to maintaining
employees prior to Closing, which amount shall paid to the Seller.

(b) With respect to any insurance claims for Casualty and Condemnation Events
that would reasonably be expected to result in the payment of amounts in
excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), Purchaser shall have
the right to participate in any settlements and related discussions with the
applicable insurance company, and Seller shall take into consideration
Purchaser's requests with respect thereto as part of its negotiations with the
applicable insurance company. In addition, without the prior written consent
of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditions, or
delayed), Seller shall not agree to any settlement or other resolution of any
open insurance claim that would reasonably be expected to result in Casualty
and Condemnation Proceeds exceeding Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000) individually.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, none of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.19 shall apply to any insurance proceeds received in respect of
business interruption insurance resulting from the shutdown of the Casino and
Hotel due to COVID.

5.20 Financial Statements.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, Seller and the
Acquired Companies shall provide Purchaser as soon as reasonably practical
after the end of each calendar month (but in no event later than thirty (30)
days after the end of each calendar month) financial statements for the
Acquired Companies as regularly prepared by the management of Seller and the
Acquired Companies in the Ordinary Course of Business. If the Closing occurs
after December 31, 2020, Seller shall (at its sole cost and expense) prepare
and provide Purchaser with a complete copy of the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Acquired Companies for the year ending December
31, 2020, consisting of the consolidated balance sheet of such Company as at
December 31, 2020 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
member's or stockholder's equity and cash flows for the year then ended (the
"2020 Audit"), as soon as practical after the preparation of such audited
financial statements in the Ordinary Course of Business (which the parties
acknowledge may occur after the Closing Date, but in no event later than the
sixtieth (60th) day following the Closing Date) and an unqualified opinion of
the independent auditor preparing such financial statements; provided, that if
the Closing occurs after December 31, 2020 and before delivery of the 2020
Audit, Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller, including by providing Seller
and its Representatives with access to the Acquired Companies' books, records,
employees and their Representatives, as may be necessary to allow Seller to
prepare the 2020 Audit.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the delivery of any Form 8-K
Financial Statements (or, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article
VIII, the date of such termination), to the extent that Purchaser determines,
following discussion with outside legal counsel and accountants, that any
financial statements of the Acquired Companies are required to be filed with
the SEC under Rule 3-05 or Rule 3-14 or Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S-X") (such financial
statements, "S-X Financial Statements"), (i) to satisfy Purchaser's reporting
obligations on Current Report on Form 8-K (or any amendments thereto) in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions as a result of the Closing (such financial statements, "Form 8-K Financial Statements"), upon
reasonable notice from Purchaser at any time after the date hereof but no
later than the tenth (10th) day following the Closing Date, Seller shall (at
Purchaser's sole expense except in the case of the audited financial
statements described in Section 5.20(a)) use commercially reasonable efforts
to prepare and deliver such Form 8-K Financial Statements, to the extent not
previously provided to Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.20(a), to Purchaser as
soon as reasonably practical (but in no event later than the sixtieth (60th)
day following the Closing Date) and (ii) in connection with any registration
statement, proxy statement, prospectus, or prospectus supplement filed with
the SEC, or offering memorandum prepared by or on behalf of Purchaser, upon
reasonable notice from Purchaser, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
(at Purchaser's sole expense except in the case of the audited financial
statements described in Section 5.20(a)) prepare and deliver such S-X
Financial Statements, to the extent not previously provided to Purchaser
pursuant to Section 5.20(a), to Purchaser as soon as reasonably practical, and
in each case shall request that the Acquired Companies' independent accounting
firm deliver a customary consent to the filing of such financial statements
with the SEC.

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.20(c), Seller
shall prior to or after the Closing Date, and prior to the Closing shall cause
the Acquired Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide
reasonable assistance and cooperation with Purchaser's preparation of any
financial statements Purchaser is required to prepare for filing with the SEC
(including by providing reasonable access to such financial information and
financial data as shall be reasonably requested by Purchaser or its
Representatives in connection with the preparation of such financial
statements) and any required pro forma financial information and pro forma
financial statements or any required non-GAAP reconciliations, in each case,
in accordance with Regulation S-X, (ii) provide reasonable assistance to
Purchaser and its independent accounting firm in completing audits and the
preparation of such financial statements and other financial information to
the extent not prepared by Seller, and (iii) upon reasonable request prior to
the Closing, deliver to Purchaser or its independent accounting firm, a
customary representation letter signed by an authorized officer of any
Acquired Company, as applicable, in such form as is reasonably required by
Purchaser's independent accounting firm; provided, that nothing in this
Section 5.20(c) shall (A) unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of Seller, any Acquired Company or their respective Subsidiaries or
(B) provided that Seller is in compliance with their obligations under Section
5.20(b) prior to such date, require assistance beyond the sixtieth (60th) day
after the Closing Date.

(d) Any S-X Financial Statements or other financial statements prepared by
Seller pursuant to Sections (b) and (c) shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP and Regulation S-X, applied on a consistent basis, throughout the periods
covered, shall present fairly the financial condition of the Acquired
Companies in all material respects as of the respective dates thereof and the
results of operations and cash flows for the periods covered thereby.

5.21 Sports Betting Licenses.

(a) Each of Seller and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare and file, not later than the Sports Betting License Filing
Deadline, all required applications, documents and other information required
by the Illinois Gaming Board necessary for the Company to request, apply for
and obtain the Illinois Sports Betting Licenses (such, applications, documents and other information, the "Sports Betting License
Applications"); provided, however, that if Purchaser notifies Seller in
writing, prior to the filing of the Sports Betting License Applications and
not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Sports Betting License
Filing Deadline that Purchaser desires for Seller and the Company to postpone
the filing of the Sports Betting License Applications with the Illinois Gaming
Board, Seller and the Company shall not file the Sports Betting License
Applications with the Illinois Gaming Board until at least ten (10) Business
Days but not more than thirty (30) days after the date that Purchaser notifies
Seller and the Company in writing that it authorizes Seller and the Company to
file the Sports Betting License Applications; provided, however, that neither
Seller nor the Company shall in any case file the Sports Betting License
Applications without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which Purchaser
may withhold in its sole discretion.

(b) Seller and the Company shall, not later than the tenth Business Day
following the date hereof, request from the Illinois Gaming Board written
confirmation that: (i) Seller and the Company may submit the Sports Betting
License Applications either without (x) the submission by a management
services provider of an accompanying management services provider license
application (the "Management Services Provider Application") or (y) Seller or
the Company designating or identifying in the Sports Betting License
Applications a management services provider; and (ii) the Illinois Gaming
Board will nonetheless process the Sports Betting License Applications (any
written confirmation of such request from the Illinois Gaming Board, a "Sports
Betting License Request Confirmation", and any written denial of such request,
a "Sports Betting License Request Denial"). Following submitting any such
request to the Illinois Gaming Board, each of Seller and the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Illinois Gaming Board to
provide the Sports Betting License Request Confirmation, including responding
as promptly as practicable to the request of the Illinois Gaming Board for
additional information and material related to the request that the Illinois
Gaming Board provide the Sports Betting License Request Confirmation by
supplying such information or material as it reasonably believes is responsive
to any request of the Illinois Gaming Board. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, Seller and the Company shall provide
Purchaser with copies of all material documents, correspondence or information
related to its request that the Illinois Gaming Board provide the Sports
Betting License Request Confirmation, including requests for further
information requested by the Illinois Gaming Board; provided, that materials
may be redacted as necessary to protect attorney-client privileged
information, personal information of any individuals, or any information of
Seller or its Affiliates not related to the Acquired Companies. Without
limiting the foregoing, unless the Illinois Gaming Board or applicable Law
requires otherwise, each of Seller and the Company shall keep Purchaser
reasonably apprised of the status of Seller's and the Company's request for
the Sports Betting License Request Confirmation, including notifying Purchaser
promptly of the receipt by it of written material comments or requests from
the Illinois Gaming Board relating to Seller's and the Company's request that
the Illinois Gaming Board provide the Sports Betting License Request
Confirmation, and shall supply Purchaser with copies of all non-confidential
material correspondence between Seller or the Company or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and the Illinois Gaming Board, on the other
hand, with respect to the Sports Betting License Request Confirmation.

(i) Sports Betting License Option A. In the event that the Illinois Gaming
Board provides Seller or the Company with a Sports Betting License Request Confirmation, and Seller and the Company have not, prior to their receipt of
the Sports Betting License Request Confirmation, with the consent of Purchaser
submitted the Sports Betting License Applications pursuant to Sports Betting
License Application Option B or Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, have not otherwise agreed that Seller and the
Company shall submit the Sports Betting License Applications pursuant to
Sports Betting License Application Option B, Seller and the Company shall,
prior to the Sports Betting License Filing Deadline applicable to Sports
Betting License Application Option A and in accordance with the terms of
Section 5.21(a) (including any extension by Purchaser of the Sports Betting
License Filing Deadline pursuant thereto), submit a Sports Betting License
Application without the Management Services Provider Application or the
designation or identification of a management services provider in the Sports
Betting License Applications (such submission, "Sports Betting License
Application Option A").

(ii) Sports Betting License Option B. In the event that (A) the Illinois
Gaming Board provides Seller or the Company with a Sports Betting License
Request Denial or (B) prior to the filing of the Sports Betting License
Applications pursuant to Sports Betting License Application Option A, Seller
and the Company, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, have
agreed to file the Sports Betting License Applications pursuant to Sports
Betting License Application Option B, then Seller and the Company shall, prior
to the Sports Betting License Filing Deadline applicable to Sports Betting
License Application Option B and in accordance with the terms of Section
5.21(a) (including any extension by Purchaser of the Sports Betting License
Filing Deadline pursuant thereto), submit the Sports Betting License
Applications identifying therein as its management services provider the
management services provider designated by Purchaser in accordance with
Section 5.21(d) ("Purchaser's Management Services Provider") (such submission,
the "Sports Betting License Application Option B"); provided, however, that
any management services provider agreement to be executed by and between the
Company and Purchaser's Management Services Provider in connection with Sports
Betting License Application Option B, if any, shall include therein a
provision providing that such agreement, if it becomes effective prior to the
Closing, (x) shall terminate immediately upon delivery by either Seller or the
Company, on the one hand or Purchaser, on the other hand, of notice to
Purchaser's Management Services Provider that this Agreement has terminated
and (y) that neither Seller nor the Company shall have any Liability to
Purchaser's Management Services Provider as a result of such termination (such
provision, the "Management Services Provider Termination Provision"). For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither
Seller nor any Acquired Company shall be required to enter into any agreement
with a Purchaser's Management Services Provider that does not contain a
Management Services Provider Termination Provision and neither Seller nor any
Acquired Company shall be required to make any payments, incur any Liability,
commit to any action, or agree to any conditions, whether or not in exchange
for the inclusion of a Management Services Provider Termination Provision.

For the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor any Acquired Company shall be
required to submit any Sports Betting License Application prior to the
issuance of a Sports Betting License Response unless Seller and Purchaser
shall mutually agree to otherwise pursue Sports Betting License Applicable
Option B.

(c) Following Seller's and the Company's submission of the Sports Betting
License Applications, whether pursuant to Sports Betting License Application
Option A or Sports Betting License Application Option B, each of Seller and the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to cause the Illinois Gaming Board to (i) approve the Sports Betting
License Applications; and (ii) issue to the Company the Illinois Sports
Betting Licenses, in each case, as promptly as practicable, including
responding as promptly as practicable to the request of the Illinois Gaming
Board for additional information and material related to the Sports Betting
License Applications by supplying such information or material as it
reasonably believes is responsive to any request of the Illinois Gaming Board
with respect to the Sports Betting License Applications. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, Seller and the Company shall
provide Purchaser with copies of all material documents, correspondence or
information related to the Sports Betting License Applications, including
requests by the Illinois Gaming Board for further information; provided, that
materials may be redacted as necessary to protect attorney-client privileged
information, personal information of any individuals, or any information of
Seller or its Affiliates not related to the Acquired Companies. Without
limiting the foregoing, unless the Illinois Gaming Board requires otherwise,
each of Seller and the Company shall keep Purchaser reasonably apprised of the
status of the Sports Betting License Applications, including notifying
Purchaser reasonably promptly of the receipt by it of written material
comments or requests from the Illinois Gaming Board relating to the Sports
Betting License Applications, and shall supply Purchaser with copies of all
non-confidential material correspondence between Seller or the Company or any
of their Representatives and the Illinois Gaming Board with respect to the
Sports Betting License Applications. Prior to Closing, each of the Seller and
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to schedule and
attend any hearings or meetings with the Illinois Gaming Board related to the
Sports Betting License Applications as promptly as reasonably practicable.
From the date of this Agreement until the Closing or the earlier termination
of this Agreement, each of Seller and the Company shall keep Purchaser
reasonably informed with respect to its pursuit of the Illinois Sports Betting
Licenses. Neither Seller nor the Company, on the one hand, nor Purchaser, on
the other hand, shall independently participate in any substantive
communication initiated by it or engaged in with advance notice from the
Illinois Gaming Board, either in person or by telephone, with the Illinois
Gaming Board in respect of the Sports Betting License Applications, without
giving the other party hereto prior notice of the communication and, to the
extent permitted by the Illinois Gaming Board, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate, in each case, to the extent practicable and permitted by
applicable Laws. Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto will consult
and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to the Sports Betting
License Applications.

(d) Within sixty (60) days following the date hereof, or such later date as
Purchaser shall determine in its sole discretion, Purchaser shall identify and
select Purchaser's Management Services Provider and provide written notice
communicating to Seller and the Company the identity of such entity (the date
that Seller and the Company receive such notice, the "MSP Designation Date").
Each of Seller and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each of
Purchaser and Purchaser's Management Services Provider in connection with the
initial filing by Purchaser's Management Services Provider of its Management
Service Provider Application with the Illinois Gaming Board and any subsequent
efforts of Purchaser's Management Services Provider to obtain the management
services provider license necessary for Purchaser's Management Services
Provider to provide the Company with those services necessary for the Company
to commence its sports wagering operation (whether at the Casino and Hotel or web-based or mobile wagering applications), including the development, design
and installation of such internal controls as shall be required by the
Illinois Gaming Board for the issuance of the Illinois Sports Betting Licenses
and any required testing lab certifications. At Purchaser's request, Seller
and the Company shall provide Purchaser with such reasonable assistance as
Purchaser may reasonably request in connection with its efforts to identify
and select Purchaser's Management Services Provider. Purchaser, Seller, and
the Company shall, subject to the limitations of Section 5.21(b)(ii), jointly
negotiate the terms of any master services provider agreement to be entered
into by the Company with Purchaser's Management Services Provider (including
the terms of the Management Services Provider Termination Provision). In the
event the parties and the Purchaser's Management Services Provider have not
agreed to the terms and conditions, and delivered a fully executed copy, of
such master services provider agreement on or before the fifth (5th) Business
Day prior the Sports Betting License Filing Deadline, the Sports Betting
License Filing Deadline shall be automatically extended for an additional 15
days, provided however, in the event the parties and the Purchaser's
Management Services Provider have not agreed to the terms and conditions, and
delivered a fully executed copy, of such master services provider agreement on
or before the fifth (5th) Business Day prior any such automatic extension of
the Sports Betting License Filing Deadline, the Sports Betting License
Deadline shall continue to automatically renew for successive 15-day periods
(each an "Sport Betting License Filing Deadline Extension", and, collectively,
the "Sport Betting License Filing Deadline Extensions").

(e) In the event that the Illinois Gaming Board issues a Sports Betting
License Request Denial and Purchaser is unable to identify and select
Purchaser's Management Services Provider, and as a result the Sports Betting
License Applications are not filed pursuant to Sports Betting License Option A
or Sports Betting License Option B, then, at the written request of Purchaser,
each of Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and Purchaser on the other
hand, shall reasonably cooperate with one another to nonetheless identify an
alternative to the approaches identified in this Section 5.21 that is
permitted under applicable Law and commercially reasonable and reasonably
satisfactory to each of Seller, the Company and Purchaser to allow for Seller
and the Company to apply for the Illinois Sports Betting Licenses and, in the
event that such an alternative is identified and pursued, Seller, the Company
and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with one another to pursue such
alternative approach in an effort to cause the Illinois Gaming Board to issue
to the Company the Illinois Sports Betting Licenses and authorize the Company
to commence its sports wagering operation (including through web-based and
mobile applications), in each case, as soon as commercially reasonably
practicable.

(f) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, Seller and the
Acquired Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of each calendar
month (but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the end of each
calendar month) with an estimate of the then outstanding Illinois Sports
Betting Licenses Costs.

(g) Following the receipt of the Illinois Sports Betting Licenses, Seller,
Parent and the Acquired Companies will not (i) directly or indirectly sell,
transfer, license, or otherwise make available such Illinois Sports Betting
Licenses to any third Person (other than, with Purchaser's prior written
consent, Purchaser's Management Services Provider) or engage or permit any
third Person (other than, with Purchaser's prior written consent, Purchaser's
Management Services Provider) to operate sports wagering pursuant to such
Illinois Sports Betting Licenses or (ii) allow any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) on the
Illinois Sports Betting Licenses. Seller, Parent and the Acquired Companies
will pay all required certificate fees, application fees, investigative fees,
testing fees and charges, maintenance, renewal or similar fees and related
costs required to be paid to obtain and maintain such Illinois Sports Betting
Licenses and otherwise take any and all actions reasonably necessary to keep
such Illinois Sports Betting Licenses valid and in good standing, provided
however, all such fees, charges, and costs will be considered Illinois Sports
Betting License Costs.

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing shall not be conditioned (or
delayed) upon the issuance of any Sport Betting License Request Response, the
approval of the Management Services Provider Application, the execution by the
Company of a master services provider agreement with Purchaser's Management
Services Provider that does not contain the Management Services Provider
Termination Provision, or the issuance of the Illinois Sports Betting License.

5.22 Community Fund. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Closing, Seller shall provide Purchaser evidence of dissolution of the Jumer's
Community Assistance Fund, Inc.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) if written notice of any

terminate with respect to such claim, and such claim may be pursued, until the
final resolution of such claim in accordance with the provisions of this
Article VII, and (y) in no case shall the expiration of the Survival Period
affect any indemnification claim based upon fraud or Willful Breach. The
rights of the parties to indemnification under this Agreement for any breach
of any representation or warranty contained herein are part of the basis of
the bargain contemplated by this Agreement, and such rights shall not be
affected, waived, modified, limited or diminished by any (and the parties
shall be deemed to have relied on the express representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding) information or knowledge of, or
the results of any due diligence investigation by or on behalf of, the party
entitled to such indemnification, and regardless of whether such knowledge was
obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. (b) Limitations on Seller's Indemnification. Seller will have no obligation to
indemnify a Purchaser Indemnified Party for any Losses pursuant to Section
7.1(a) until such time as such Losses, in the aggregate, exceed One Million
Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000.00) (the "Basket") at which point
Seller shall only be liable for the aggregate amount of all Losses in excess
of the Basket, provided, that no Loss may be claimed by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party or shall be reimbursable by Seller or shall be included in
calculating the aggregate Losses set forth above other than Losses in excess
of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) (the "Per Claim Amount") resulting from any
single claim or aggregated claims arising out of related facts, events or
circumstances. The maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses for which Seller
shall be liable pursuant to Section 7.1(a) shall be equal to Twelve Million
Dollars ($12,000,000.00) (the "Indemnity Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnity Cap, the Per Claim Amount and the Basket shall not apply to
indemnification claims made by a Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to
breaches of the Fundamental Representations or based upon fraud or Willful
Breach. Further, in no event shall the aggregate amount required to be paid by
Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(a) exceed the Purchase Price, provided this
sentence shall not apply to indemnification claims made by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party based upon fraud or Willful Breach.

(c) Limitations on Purchaser's Indemnification. Purchaser will have no
obligation to indemnify a Seller Indemnified Party for any Losses pursuant to
Section 7.2(a) until such time as such Losses, in the aggregate, exceed the
Basket at which point Purchaser shall only be liable for the aggregate amount
of all Losses in excess of the Basket, provided, that no Loss may be claimed
by a Purchaser Indemnified Party or shall be reimbursable by Purchaser or
shall be included in calculating the aggregate Losses set forth above other
than Losses in excess of the Per Claim Amount resulting from any single claim
or aggregated claims arising out of related facts, events or circumstances.
The maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses for which Purchaser shall be liable
pursuant to Section 7.2(a) shall be equal to the Indemnity Cap.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnity Cap and the Basket shall not
apply to indemnification claims made by a Seller Indemnified Party with
respect to breaches of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations or based upon
fraud or Willful Breach. Further, in no event shall the aggregate amount
required to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.2(a) exceed the
Purchase Price, provided this sentence shall not apply to indemnification
claims made by a Seller Indemnified Party based upon fraud or Willful Breach.

(d) Other Limitations, No Multiple Recovery. Any payment by an Indemnifying
Party shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds actually recovered
by the Indemnified Party (net of any Losses incurred in obtaining such
recovery, which shall include any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs, fees or expenses incurred to procure such proceeds and the amount of
any increased insurance premiums, retentions or other costs arising
therefrom). The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from its insurers any insurance proceeds in respect of any claim for
which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement at the
direction of the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover from an Indemnifying Party more than once for any particular Loss, nor
shall any Indemnifying Party be liable or otherwise obligated to indemnify any
Indemnified Party for the same Loss more than once (it being acknowledged and
agreed that the intent of this sentence is to avoid "double recovery" for a
single Loss). (e) Materiality. For purposes of determining (i) whether a breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty has occurred and (ii) the dollar
amount of Losses with respect to any claim resulting from any breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, all "material", "materiality", "in
all material respects", or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications or
exceptions in such representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

7.4 Notice of Claims.

(a) Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder (or believing in
good faith that it may suffer or incur Losses for which it is or may be
entitled to indemnification hereunder) shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party
a written notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail available
facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder and shall
include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of
computation of the amount of such claim (if readily available) and a reference
to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or
instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim
is based; provided, that a Claim Notice in respect of any Third Person Claim
shall be given reasonably promptly after an Indemnified Party has received
written notice that the Proceeding has been commenced; provided further that
failure to timely give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall
have been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
Article VII shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party; (ii) by a final judgment or
decree of any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
agree in writing (each, a "Final Resolution"); provided, however, that if a
Claim Notice does not involve a Third Person Claim and the Indemnifying Party
does not dispute its liability for the claim described in such Claim Notice
within twenty (20) calendar days following delivery of such Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party will be conclusively deemed liable for the Losses arising
from such claim. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when
the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been
taken or when all appeals shall have been finally determined.

7.5 Third Person Indemnification Procedure.

(a) The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than twenty (20) calendar days following
delivery of a Claim Notice regarding a Third Person Claim whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party and whether
the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such
Third Person Claim. Upon the Indemnifying Party's election to defend against
such Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its sole
cost and expense, to assume control, through counsel of its choosing, of the
defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Person Claim; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party's right to assume control of the defense,
compromise or settlement of any Third Person Claim is subject to the following
conditions: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have agreed in writing to be responsible for
the Losses of the Indemnified Party relating to such Third Person Claim,
subject to the express limitations of Article VII;

(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably
informed of the status and progress of such Third Person Claim and the defense
thereof;

(iii) the Third Person Claim does not involve a criminal Proceeding or a
Proceeding brought by a Governmental Authority or a Proceeding to which a
Governmental Authority is an opposing party;

(iv) the Third Person Claim does not involve non-monetary, equitable or
injunctive relief against the Indemnified Party; and

(v) the Third Person Claim, or the defense, compromise or settlement thereof,
is not in the good faith and reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party,
adverse to the Indemnified Party's continuing business interests (including
the Indemnified Party's relationships with current customers, suppliers or
other parties material to the business of the Indemnified Party).

The Indemnifying Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to vigorously
and diligently prosecute to final conclusion or settlement any Third Person
Claim that it has undertaken the defense of in connection with this Section
7.5(a). Subject to the final sentence of this paragraph, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to settle or compromise any such Proceeding, or
otherwise acknowledge or admit the validity of such Proceeding, or any Loss in
respect thereof without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party may settle or compromise such
Proceeding so long as such settlement or compromise: (x) does not lead to any
Liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnified Party; (y) provides, in customary form reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all Liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third
Person Claim; and (z) does not involve non-monetary, equitable or injunctive
relief against the Indemnified Party.

(b) The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate, through counsel
chosen by it, in the defense of any Third Person Claim of which the
Indemnifying Party is controlling, and the Indemnified Party will bear its own
costs and expenses with respect to such separate counsel except that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the costs and expenses of such separate counsel
if the Indemnified Party reasonably determines based on the written advice of
outside legal counsel (i) that there may be one or more defenses or defense
strategies available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to an applicable Indemnifying Party or (ii) that
there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense of such
Third Person Claim within twenty (20) days following its receipt of a Claim
Notice, or if any of the conditions in Section 7.5(a) fail to be met at any
time thereafter, or if the Indemnifying Party otherwise breaches this Section 7.5, the Indemnified Party shall have the sole
right to, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend,
compromise or settle the Third Person Claim on behalf of and for the account
and risk of the Indemnifying Party (but only to the extent that it is finally
determined that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the
Indemnifying Party pursuant this Article VII), provided, however, that such
Third Person Claim shall not be compromised or settled without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Indemnified Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including (except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence) any settlement thereof. The Indemnifying Party may retain separate
counsel to participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement
controlled by the Indemnified Party, pursuant to this Section 7.5(c), and the
Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third Person
Claim pursuant to this Section 7.5(c), the Indemnified Party shall keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense,
compromise or settlement of such Third Person Claim, and the Indemnifying
Party will promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for its reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such defense.

7.6 Exclusive Remedies. Except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach,
following the Closing, the remedies provided in this Article VII shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedies with respect to any and all claims
for breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that this exclusive remedy
does not preclude a party from bringing an action for specific performance or
other equitable remedy or injunctive relief following the Closing to the
extent not otherwise prohibited hereunder to require a party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement (including a party's obligations under
Section 5.15) or any Related Agreement, including the Transition Services
Agreement, or to enforce any decision or determination of the Accounting Firm.

7.7 Coordination with Liability for Taxes. If there shall be any conflicts
between the provisions of this Article VII and Section 5.11 (Tax Matters), the
provisions of Section 5.11 shall control with respect to liability for Taxes.

7.8 Adjustment to Purchase Price. Any payment by Purchaser or Seller under
Article V or this Article VII shall, to the extent such payment can be
properly so characterized under applicable Tax Law, be treated by the parties
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION



8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

(b) by either Seller or Purchaser if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before June 30, 2021 (such date, the "Outside Date"); provided, however, so
long as conditions set forth Sections 6.1(a)-(c) have been satisfied (and the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1(d) have not been satisfied) as of the
Outside Date and as of each subsequent Outside Date Extension, the Outside Date may be extended solely for the purposes of receiving the Required
Gaming Approvals set forth in Section 6.1(d), as set forth below:

(1) Purchaser may (but shall not be obligated to) elect to extend the Outside
Date to July 31, 2021 (the "First Outside Date Extension") by (x) paying the
First Outside Date Extension Deposit Increase; and (y) delivering written
notice to Seller of Purchaser's election of the First Outside Date Extension,
in each case no later than the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the
expiration of the Outside Date;

(2) Purchaser may (but shall not be obligated to) elect to extend the Outside
Date to August 31, 2021 (the "Second Outside Date Extension") by (x) paying
the Second Outside Date Extension Deposit Increase; and (y) delivering written
notice to Seller of Purchaser's election of the Second Outside Date Extension,
in each case no later than the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the
expiration of the First Outside Date Extension; and

(3) Purchaser may (but shall not be obligated to) elect to extend the Outside
Date to September 30, 2021 (the "Third Outside Date Extension", and, together
with the First Outside Date Extension and the Second Outside Date Extension,
collectively, the "Outside Date Extensions") by (x) paying the Third Outside
Date Extension Deposit Increase; and (y) delivering written notice to Seller
of Purchaser's election of the Third Outside Date Extension, in each case no
later than the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the expiration of the Second
Outside Date Extension;

provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any party if its failure to fulfill
any material obligation under this Agreement was the primary cause of,
materially contributed to or shall have resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

(c) by either Seller or Purchaser, in the event of (i) a breach by the other
party, of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, that (x)
would result in the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
Section 6.3(a), as applicable and (y) by its nature cannot be cured by the
Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, has not been cured within the
earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to the
breaching party of such breach and (B) the Outside Date or (ii) a breach by
the other party, of any of its obligations contained in this Agreement, that
(x) would result in the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(b) or
Section 6.3(b), as applicable and (y) by its nature cannot be cured by the
Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, has not been cured within the
earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to the
breaching party of such breach and (B) the Outside Date;

(d) by either Seller or Purchaser, if any Governmental Authority (including a
Gaming Authority) has made a final determination that such Governmental
Authority will not issue a Transaction Approval (including a Required Gaming
Approval) that is necessary to satisfy the condition set forth in Section
6.1(d) or if Purchaser withdraws its application for any required Transaction
Approval in response to a communication from a Governmental Authority
regarding a likely or impending denial of a Transaction Approval), provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any material
obligation under this Agreement was the primary cause of or materially contributed to the determination of the applicable Governmental Authority to
not issue the required Transaction Approval;

(e) by either Purchaser or Seller if any Governmental Authority shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law, Order or final non-
appealable judgment which has the effect of making illegal, materially
restricting or preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions (a "Final Regulatory Action"); provided, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall not be available to
any party whose failure to fulfill any material obligation under this
Agreement was the primary cause of or materially contributed to such Final
Regulatory Action;

(f) by Seller, if Purchaser has not completed and submitted the Regulatory and
Licensing Submissions by the Initial Regulatory Filing Deadline, provided
however, Seller may only terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(f) during the period beginning immediately following the Initial
Regulatory Filing Deadline and ending at 11:59 p.m. central time on October
15, 2020 (such period, the "Regulatory Filing Termination Period"); or

(g) by Purchaser in the event of a Material Adverse Effect.

For purposes of this Section 8.1, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, breach, action or failure to act by an Acquired Company shall be
considered to be a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, breach,
action or failure to act by Seller.

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by a
party pursuant to Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall promptly be given
to the other party hereto, and upon such notice this Agreement shall
terminate. Except as provided under this Section 8.2 or otherwise expressly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, upon termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and of no further force and effect, there shall be no liability on the part of
any party hereto to the other party, and all rights and obligations of any
party hereto shall cease and the parties shall be released from any and all
obligations hereunder; provided, that (i) the provisions of Section 2.12,
Section 5.3(b), Section 5.5, Section 5.10, Section 8.2, Section 8.3, and
Article IX shall survive any such termination; and (ii) nothing in this
Agreement shall relieve any party from liability for damages resulting from
fraud or Willful Breach, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled
to all rights and remedies available at Law or in equity.

8.3 Reverse Termination Fee.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated: (i) by Purchaser or Seller pursuant to
Section 8.1(b); or (ii) by Purchaser or Seller pursuant to Sections
8.1(d)-(f); provided that, (x) in the case of a termination described in
Section 8.3(a)(i), at the time of such termination, the condition to Closing
set forth in Section 6.1(a) (unless Section 6.1(a) has not been satisfied due
to an injunction or other order that has been entered in respect of the
approvals required under the HSR Act or a Gaming Approval) has been satisfied,
and (y) in the case of a termination described in Sections 8.3(a)(i) and (ii),
at the time of such termination, the conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 6.2(a)-(d) (in each case, other than such conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied (and are capable of being satisfied) at the Closing
or are conditioned on the Closing occurring) have been satisfied or waived and Seller is entitled to terminate this
Agreement under the terms of Section 8.1(b), Section 8.1(d), Section 8.1(e) or
Section 8.1(f), as applicable (such events, collectively, the "Reverse
Termination Fee Events"); Seller shall retain the Deposit, including any
increases set forth in Section 8.3(b) as the Reverse Termination Fee.

(b) The "Reverse Termination Fee" shall initially equal the amount of the
Initial Deposit, and shall be increased (collectively, "Deposit Increases") as
set forth below.

(i) If Purchaser does not complete the Regulatory and Licensing Submissions
before the Initial Regulatory Filing Deadline and the Seller does not
terminate this Agreement during the Regulatory Filing Termination Period
pursuant to Section 8.1(f), the Reverse Termination Fee shall increase to
$6,000,000 and Purchaser shall deposit $2,000,000 by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Deposit Account within five (5) Business
Days of the expiration of the Regulatory Filing Termination Period.

(ii) In the event the Closing does not occur on or before March 31, 2021, the
Reverse Termination Fee shall increase to $8,000,000 and Purchaser shall
deposit $2,000,000 (or, in the event the Deposit was not increased pursuant to
Section 8.3(b)(i), $4,000,000) by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the Deposit Account on or before April 7, 2021; provided, however, that the
Reverse Termination Fee shall not increase to $8,000,000 (and shall remain at
$4,000,000 or $6,000,000, as the case may be) in the event that as of March
31, 2021, (A) the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.2(a)-(d) (in
each case, other than such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
(and are capable of being satisfied) at the Closing or are conditioned on the
Closing occurring) have been satisfied or waived, or (B) an applicable Gaming
Authority has not processed Purchaser's Regulatory and Licensing Submissions
or provided the Required Gaming Approvals (so long as Purchaser has undertaken
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Gaming Approvals from the
applicable Gaming Authority).

(iii) In the event Purchaser elects the First Outside Date Extension, as a
condition to such First Outside Date Extension, Purchaser shall deposit an
additional $2,000,000 (the "First Outside Date Extension Deposit Increase") by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Deposit Account on or
before two (2) Business Days prior to the expiration of the Outside Date, and
the Reverse Termination Fee shall be increased by such First Outside Date
Extension Deposit Increase;

(iv) In the event Purchaser elects the Second Outside Date Extension, as a
condition to such Second Outside Date Extension, Purchaser shall deposit an
additional $2,000,000 (the "Second Outside Date Extension Deposit Increase")
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Deposit Account on or
before two (2) Business Days prior to the expiration of the First Outside Date
Extension, and the Reverse Termination Fee shall be increased by such Second
Outside Date Extension Deposit Increase; and

(v) In the event Purchaser elects the Third Outside Date Extension, as a
condition to such Third Outside Date Extension, Purchaser shall deposit an
additional $2,000,000 (the "Third Outside Date Extension Deposit Increase"
and, together with the First Outside Date Extension Deposit Increase and the
Second Outside Date Deposit Increase, collectively, the "Outside Date
Extension Deposit Increases") by wire transfer of immediately available funds the Deposit Account on or before two (2) Business Days prior to the expiration
of the Second Outside Date Extension, and the Reverse Termination Fee shall be
increased by such Third Outside Date Extension Deposit Increase; and

(vi) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b), and
such termination qualifies as a Reverse Termination Fee Event pursuant to
Section 8.3(a), the Reverse Termination Fee shall be no less than $8,000,000,
regardless of whether the Deposit then equals $8,000,000, provided however,
for the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.1(b) after giving effect to any Outside Date Extensions, the
Reverse Termination Fee shall equal the Deposit at the time of such
termination (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Outside Date Extension
Deposit Increases).

(c) After the occurrence of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to a
Reverse Termination Fee Event, Seller shall have the right to retain the
Deposit without any further action; provided that any interest earned on the
Deposit, less any banking fees associated with the separate account, shall be
paid to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by Purchaser in writing promptly, but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after the date this Agreement is
terminated as a result of a Reverse Termination Fee Event. For the avoidance
of doubt, in the event the Purchaser has not paid any required Deposit
Increases, at the time of any Reverse Termination Fee Event, Purchaser shall
pay to the Seller an amount equal to: (x) the Reverse Termination Fee in
effect at the time of, and applicable to, such Reverse Termination Fee Event,
minus (y) the amount of the Deposit that has been actually deposited into the
Deposit Account at the time of such Reverse Termination Fee Event, to be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated by Seller in writing promptly, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after the date this Agreement is terminated as a result of a
Reverse Termination Fee Event.

(d) Subject to Section 8.3(e), any amount retained by Seller or paid and
payable by Purchaser, in each case, pursuant to Section 8.3 will be payable
only one time and, in a circumstance where the Reverse Termination Fee is paid
(whether as a result of Seller's return of the Deposit or Purchaser's request
of any amount payable pursuant to the second sentence of Section 8.3(c), or a
combination thereof) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller,
the Acquired Companies and their respective members and Affiliates for all
Losses of such Persons in connection with any and all claims for any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth
herein or otherwise relating to the termination of this Agreement, except in
the case of a claim arising out of fraud or Willful Breach.

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated other than as a result of a
Reverse Termination Fee Event, Seller shall, not later than five (5) Business
Days after the date this Agreement is terminated, pay to Purchaser, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchaser
in writing, an amount in cash equal to the Deposit less $2,000,000.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties acknowledge
that Seller's right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee shall not limit or
otherwise affect Seller's right to specific performance as provided in Section
9.11 and that Seller may pursue both a grant of specific performance under
Section 9.11 and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee under this Section 8.3; provided that the Seller shall not be permitted or entitled
to receive both a grant of specific performance to cause the Closing to occur
and the Reverse Termination Fee.

(a) Jurisdiction. Each party, by its execution hereof, (i) hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or federal courts of the United States located in the State of
Delaware for the purpose of any Proceeding between the parties arising in
whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions, (ii) hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise, in any such Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that any such Proceeding brought in one
of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of forum non
conveniens, should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of
the above named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some
other proceeding in any other court other than one of the above-named courts,
or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or
by such court, and (iii) hereby agrees not to commence any such Proceeding
other than before one of the above-named courts. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence a party may commence any Proceeding in a court other than the above-
named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued
by one of the above-named courts.

(b) Venue. Each party agrees that for any Proceeding between the parties
arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement, such
party will bring Proceedings only in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or federal courts of the United States located in the State of
Delaware. Each party further waives any claim and will not assert that venue
should properly lie in any other location within the selected jurisdiction.

(c) Service of Process. Each party hereby (i) consents to service of process
in any Proceeding between the parties arising in whole or in part under or in
connection with this Agreement in any manner permitted by Delaware law, (ii)
agrees that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or made by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address
specified pursuant to Section 9.1, will constitute good and valid service of
process in any such Proceeding and (iii) waives and agrees not to assert (by
way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such Proceeding any claim
that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does not
constitute good and valid service of process.

9.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT
CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT
ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF
THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF
THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES
IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER
BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS, WHICH ACTION WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

9.9 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith with a view to the substitution therefor of a
suitable and equitable solution in order to carry out, so far as may be valid
and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid provision, provided,
that the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every
other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be in
any way impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and
privileges of the parties hereto shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

9.10 Expenses. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, each party to
this Agreement shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions, whether or not the Contemplated Transactions
are consummated, including all fees and expenses of agents, representatives,
counsel and accountants.

9.11 Specific Performance. Except as set forth in Section 8.3, the parties
agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages or other legal
remedies would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached by the parties. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or
equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Chancery Court of Delaware or federal court in Delaware, without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each party further agrees that no other
party nor any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this Section 9.11, and each party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

9.12 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one instrument. Facsimile or other electronically transmitted signatures shall be
deemed originals for all purposes of this Agreement.

9.13 Access to Records after Closing. For a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date, Purchaser and its Representatives shall have reasonable access
to all of the books and records relating to the Shares and the Purchased
Interests, the Acquired Companies or the Business which Seller or any of its
Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by
Seller and its Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during
normal business hours. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for its costs and
expenses incurred pursuant to this Section 9.13. If Seller or any of its
Affiliates shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to
the expiration of such six-year period, Seller shall, prior to such
disposition, give Purchaser a reasonable opportunity, at Purchaser's expense,
to segregate and remove such books and records as Purchaser may select.

9.14 Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule and Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs contained in this Agreement. The
disclosures in any section or paragraph of the Disclosure Schedule and
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule shall qualify (a) the corresponding section or
paragraph in the Agreement and (b) other sections or paragraphs in the
Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that it also qualifies such other section or paragraph. The
inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the
materiality of such item or whether such items constitute a Material Adverse
Effect.

9.15 Privileged Communications. Jones Day and Seller's in-house legal
department (collectively, "Counsel") have acted as counsel for Seller and the
Acquired Companies for various matters prior to the Closing, including in
connection with this Agreement and the Related Agreements, the negotiation and
documentation of this Agreement and the Related Agreements, and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (collectively, the "Pre-Closing
Engagements"). Purchaser agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing,
on behalf of the Acquired Companies, that (a) all communications in any form
or format whatsoever between or among Counsel, on the one hand, and Seller,
the Acquired Companies, or any of their respective Representatives, on the
other hand, that relate in any way to the Pre-Closing Engagements
(collectively, the "Privileged Communications") shall be deemed to be
attorney-client privileged, (b) immediately prior to the Closing, without the
need for any further action on the part of any Person, all right, title, and
interest of the Acquired Companies in and to any and all Privileged
Communications shall transfer to and be vested solely in Seller, (c) from and
after the Closing, the Privileged Communications and the expectation of client
confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to Seller and may be
controlled by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the
Acquired Companies, and (d) Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such Privileged Communications, or any of its files relating to
the Pre Closing Engagements, to Purchaser, the Acquired Companies, or any of
their respective Representatives by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Counsel and the Acquired Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything set forth in the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.15 to the
contrary, if after the Closing a dispute arises between Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and a third
Person, other than Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, the
Acquired Companies may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of Privileged Communications to such third Person; provided, that
neither Purchaser nor the Acquired Companies may waive such privilege without
the written consent of Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

9.16 No Waiver of Privilege; Protection from Disclosure or Use. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable attorney-
client privilege related to any Privileged Communication. Purchaser
acknowledges that Seller has undertaken reasonable efforts to prevent the
disclosure of Privileged Communications. Notwithstanding such efforts, the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions could result in the inadvertent
disclosure of such Privileged Communications. The parties hereto agree that
any such inadvertent disclosure of any Privileged Communications shall not
constitute a waiver of or otherwise prejudice any claim of confidentiality,
privilege, or protection from disclosure.



9.17 Parent Guarantee.

(a) Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally, as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, guarantees to Purchaser the full and timely payment by
Seller when due of any obligation of Seller pursuant to this Agreement to the
extent the same is required to be paid by Seller pursuant to the terms and
subject to the conditions and limitations thereof.

(b) Parent hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the date hereof
and as of the Closing as follows:

(i) Parent is a corporation (A) duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and (B) with all
requisite corporate power and authority to own and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as presently conducted.

(ii) Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions. The execution and delivery by Parent of this
Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
Parent and no other proceedings (corporate or otherwise) on the part of Parent
or its board of directors or stockholders are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and constitutes (assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto) the
legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent enforceable against Parent in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
restructuring or other Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally
and general principles of equity (irrespective of whether enforcement is
sought in a proceeding at law or in equity); and

(iii) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions do not and will not, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, conflict with, contravene, result in
any violation of or default under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation under, or require a consent or
waiver under, (A) any Law or Order applicable to Parent, (B) any terms or conditions of Parent's Charter Documents, or (C) any material
Contract to which Parent is a party or by which Parent or any of its assets is
bound.

(c) Parent shall not assign (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other Person without the
prior written consent of Purchaser. Any attempted assignment in violation of
this Section 9.17(c) shall be null and void; provided, that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing shall restrict
Parent from the sale, transfer, exchange, assignment or other disposition by
any means of a majority of its equity securities, or all or substantially all
of its assets; provided, however, in connection with any such transaction, the
successor to Parent or purchaser of substantially all of Parent's assets shall
expressly assume in writing Parent's obligations hereunder, a copy of which
written assumption agreement shall be provided to Purchaser.

9.18 TRWH Guarantee.

(a) TRWH hereby irrevocably and unconditionally, as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, guarantees to Seller the full and timely payment by
Purchaser when due of any obligation of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement
to the extent the same is required to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to the
terms and subject to the conditions and limitations thereof.

(b) TRWH hereby represents and warrants to Seller as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing as follows:

(i) TRWH is a corporation (A) duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and (B) with all requisite
corporate power and authority to own and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as presently conducted.

(ii) TRWH has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions. The execution and delivery by TRWH of this
Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of TRWH
and no other proceedings (corporate or otherwise) on the part of TRWH or its
board of directors or stockholders are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by TRWH and constitutes (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto) the legal,
valid and binding obligation of TRWH enforceable against TRWH in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, restructuring or
other Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and general
principles of equity (irrespective of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity); and

(iii) The execution, delivery and performance by TRWH of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions do not and will not, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, conflict with, contravene, result in
any violation of or default under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation under, or require a consent or
waiver under, (A) any Law or Order applicable to TRWH or (B) any terms or
conditions of TRWH's Charter Documents. (c) TRWH shall not assign (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other Person without the
prior written consent of Seller. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
Section 9.18(c) shall be null and void; provided, that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing shall restrict
TRWH from the sale, transfer, exchange, assignment or other disposition by any
means of a majority of its equity securities, or all or substantially all of
its assets; provided, however, in connection with any such transaction, the
successor to TRWH or purchaser of substantially all of TRWH's assets shall
expressly assume in writing TRWH's obligations hereunder, a copy of which
written assumption agreement shall be provided to Seller.
