 Section 4.6  _Financing_. Section 4.6 of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth true and complete copies of (i) an executed equity commitment letter from Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P. (the " _Sponsor_ ") to provide equity financing (the " _Equity Financing_ ") to Parent and/or Merger Sub (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), (ii) an executed rollover commitment letter (the " _Rollover Letter_ ") from HFCP VI Domestic AIV, L.P., HandF Harrington AIV II, L.P., Hellman and Friedman Capital Executives VI, L.P. and Hellman and Friedman Capital Associates VI, L.P. (collectively, the " _Rollover Investors_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Rollover Investors have committed to contribute to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or a direct Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation the amount of shares of Common Stock and Units set forth therein and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Unit Purchase Agreement attached thereto (the " _Rollover Investment_ ") and (iii) an executed debt commitment letter and related term sheets (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have committed to provide Parent and/or Merger Sub with loans in the amounts described therein, the proceeds of which may be used to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity Financing pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, each of the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent or Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of the Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms. As of the date hereof, each of the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letter is in full force and effect, and neither of the Financing Commitments nor the Rollover Letter has been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Parent, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letter. As of the date hereof, there is no fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (A) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letter inaccurate in any material respect, (B) result in any of the conditions in the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letter not being satisfied or (C) otherwise result in 

   ##### 

  

 

the Financing not being available, or the Rollover Investment not being
made. As of the date hereof, neither the Sponsor nor any Lender has notified
Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate either of the Financing
Commitments or not to provide the Financing, and none of the Rollover
Investors has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate
the Rollover Letter or not to make the Rollover Investment. Assuming (1) the
Financing is funded in accordance with its terms and conditions, (2) the
Rollover Investment is made in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Rollover Letter and (3) the satisfaction of the conditions to the Parent
and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger set forth in Sections
6.2(a), 6.2(b), 6.2(c) and 6.2(d), the net proceeds from the Financing will,
together with the Rollover Investment, be sufficient to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
payment by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger Consideration, any fees and
expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation,
and any related repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Parent or Merger Sub has paid in full any and all commitment
or other fees required by the Financing Commitments that are due as of the
date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such commitments and
fees as they become due. There are no side letters, understandings or other
agreements or arrangements relating to the Financing (except for customary fee
letters and engagement letters which do not contain any additional conditions
to closing or other agreements relating to the availability of the full
amount of the Financing, and a complete copy of the fee letter has been made
available to the Company with customary redactions of fee amounts and
certain other terms) or the Rollover Investment to which Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Affiliates are a party that relate to the amount,
availability or conditions of the Financing or the Rollover Investment, other
than the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letter. There are no
conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as explicitly set forth in the Financing Commitments,
and there are no conditions precedent related to the contribution of the full
amount of the Rollover Investment, other than as explicitly set forth in the
Rollover Letter. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to the Parent and
Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger set forth in Sections
6.2(a), 6.2(b), 6.2(c) and 6.2(d), neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or the
contribution of the full amount of the Rollover Investment, or that the
Financing will not be available to, or that the Rollover Investment will not
be contributed to, Parent or Merger Sub or other applicable Person on the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing
under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger, for Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain the Financing, the Rollover Investment or any
alternative financing. 

   

 Section 4.7 _Solvency_. On and as of the Closing Date, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing and any alternative financing (including any financing to be issued or incurred in lieu of the bridge facility in the Debt Commitment Letter) permitted by this Agreement, the payment of the Merger Consideration, the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the Debt Financing, and the repayment or refinancing of debt as contemplated herein and in the Debt Commitment Letter, and assuming (i) the Company is Solvent immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, or the waiver of such conditions and (iii) any estimates, projections or 

   ##### 

  

 

forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith
based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, will be Solvent. 

   

 Section 4.8 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Legal Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or any of its Affiliates before any Governmental Authority that would or seeks to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates is subject to any Order of, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any Order of any Governmental Authority that would or seeks to materially delay or prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.9 _No Regulatory Impediment_. There is no material fact relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates respective businesses, operations, financial condition or legal status, including any officers, directors or current employees status, that would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the parties to this Agreement to obtain, on a timely basis, any authorization, consent, Order, declaration or approval of, or ability to contract with, any Governmental Authority or third party necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.10 _Absence of Certain Arrangements_. Other than this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Rollover Letter and those other agreements contemplated hereby, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or the Company Board or any of their respective Affiliates (including any of the Principal Stockholders), on the other hand, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company after the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 4.11 _Brokers_. The Company will not be responsible for any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission to any broker, finder or investment banker in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, other than any such fee that is conditioned upon consummation of the Merger. 

  

 Section 4.12 _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company a limited guarantee of Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P. (the " _Guarantor_ ") in favor of the Company, dated the date hereof (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with its terms, the " _Limited Guarantee_ "). The Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and has not been amended, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under the Limited Guarantee.

cause the Company to take any such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, to the extent
required in order for such applicable Person to make a Takeover Proposal. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), following the receipt by the Company of a Takeover Proposal after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if the Company Board determines in good faith, (i) after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (ii) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the actions set forth in clauses (A) and (B) below with respect to such Takeover Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, then the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal, prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote (after which time the Company and its Representatives shall cease immediately all such actions), (A) furnish access and non-public information with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so long as any material non-public information provided under this clause (A) has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (B) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal.

 (e) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d), the Company Board may, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company Board after the date of this Agreement, terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect to such Superior Proposal, but only if: 

   

 (i) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.4; 

  

 (ii) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall include (A) to the extent provided to the Company, an unredacted copy of any material Contract relating to such Superior Proposal that contains the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and (B) the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "); and 

  

 (iii) Parent does not make, within five calendar days after a Notice of Superior Proposal is delivered to Parent (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the financial or other terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require an additional notice to Parent and an additional two calendar day period), a binding and irrevocable written and complete proposal (including any schedules or exhibits) that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, causes the Superior Proposal described in such Notice of Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , that during such five calendar day period after a Notice of Superior Proposal is provided to Parent (or such two calendar day period after an additional notice of any material change to the financial or other terms and conditions of a Superior Proposal is provided to Parent), the Company shall, and shall direct its financial and legal advisors, to negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Superior Proposal described in such Notice of Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time before obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if the Company has complied in all material respects under this Section 5.4, and the Company Board has concluded in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that its failure to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company Board may withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent. 

   

 (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the issuance of a "stop, look 

     ##### 

  

    

and listen" statement (or other similar statement pursuant to any requirement
of applicable Law) constitute a change, withdrawal, modification or amendment
of the Company Board Recommendation under this Agreement. 

   

 (h) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4 by any Representatives of the Company, other than General Atlantic LLC or Hellman and Friedman LLC or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any director of the Company), shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4.

    ##### 

  

    

 _provided_ , that no representation or warranty is made by the Company

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, after the Effective Time, nothing herein shall (i) prevent the amendment or termination of any employee benefit plan in accordance with the terms of such employee benefit plan or interfere with the Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform to or comply with applicable Law or (ii) limit the right of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any Employee after the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor all Company Employee Benefits (including all severance and similar plans and agreements) in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,

specific plan, program policy, agreement or arrangement, or interfere with
Parents, the Surviving Corporations or any of their respective Affiliates
rights or obligations to make such changes, in each case as are necessary to
comply with applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the later of
the duration of the Continuation Period or the remaining term of any
individual employment, severance or separation agreement in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide each Employee
who suffers a termination of employment under circumstances that would have
given the Employee a right to severance payments and benefits under the
Companys severance policy or individual employment, severance or separation
agreement or other arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " _Company Severance Plan_ ") with severance payments and
benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to
such Employee under any Company Severance Plan. Following the end of the
Continuation Period, Parent shall be permitted to alter the duties and
employment terms applicable to a given Employee solely to the extent
permitted under the terms of any employment agreement with such Employee, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations (to the extent waived, satisfied or inapplicable under the corresponding plan maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which any Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy or individual agreement or other arrangement applicable to such Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (the " _Vacation Policy_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to, (i) allow such Employee to use such accrued vacation and (ii) if any Employees employment terminates during the Continuation Period under circumstances entitling the Employee to severance pay under the Company Severance Plan, pay the Employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the accrued vacation time. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (e) Any and all bonus or other compensation arrangements adopted or to be adopted before the Closing which relate to services to be performed through the Closing or on or after the Closing, including without limitation any arrangements disclosed in Section 5.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be finalized, and the allocations to individual participants shall be made, by the Company subject to reasonable consultation with Parent. 

   

 (f) Without limiting Section 8.11, nothing in this Section 5.6, whether express or implied, shall confer upon any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, any rights or remedies including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.6.

 (a) For a period of six years following the Effective Time ( _provided_ , that such period shall be extended with respect to all unresolved claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party as of the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claims are finally resolved), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of any present or former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the fiduciaries of any Company Employee Benefits (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in (i) the Organizational Documents of the Company, (ii) the minutes of any meetings of the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board, (iii) the minutes of any meetings of the boards of directors, or any committee of the boards of directors or equivalent governing bodies, of any of the Subsidiaries, (iv) agreements between an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or (v) otherwise in effect at the Effective Time, to survive the Merger and to continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time or, if longer, for such period as is set forth in any applicable agreement with an Indemnified Party in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time ( _provided_ , that such period shall be extended with respect to all unresolved claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party as of the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claims are finally resolved), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their services as directors, officers or employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries or another Person, if such Indemnified Party is or was serving as a director or officer or other capacity of such other Person at the request of the Company, or fiduciaries of Company Employee Benefits, whether asserted or claimed at, after or before the Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise). If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any Legal Action in connection with any matter subject to indemnification hereunder, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, advance as incurred any costs or expenses (including legal fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities (" _Damages_ ") arising out 

     ##### 

  

    

of or incurred in connection with such Legal Action, subject to Parents or
the Surviving Corporations, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or
on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if required by the DGCL, to repay such
Damages if it is ultimately determined under applicable Law that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. In the event of any
such Legal Action, (i) each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Legal Action
and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Legal Action pending
or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and in
respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such Legal Action. 

   

 (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, maintain in effect for at least six years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) so long as Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not required to pay an annual premium in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance before the date of this Agreement (such 250% amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If Parent and the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the arrangements contemplated by this Section 5.7(c), before the Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the matters described in this Section 5.7(c) and, if the Company elects to purchase such a policy before the Effective Time, then Parent and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section 5.7(c) shall be satisfied so long as Parent and the Surviving Corporation cause such policy to be maintained in effect for a period of six years following the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Parent hereby acknowledges that the Indemnified Parties may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by other Persons. Parent hereby agrees that (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation are the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., their obligations to the Indemnified Parties are primary and any obligation of such other Persons to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by any such Indemnified Party are secondary), (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by any such Indemnified Party and shall be liable for the full indemnifiable amounts, without regard to any rights any such Indemnified Party may have against any such other Person and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation irrevocably waive, relinquish and release such other Persons from any and all claims against any such other Persons for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Each of Parent and Surviving Corporation further agrees that no advancement or payment by any of such other Persons on behalf of any such Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for which such Indemnified Party has sought indemnification from the 

     ##### 

  

    

Surviving Corporation shall affect the foregoing and such other Persons shall
have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such
advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Indemnified
Party against the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (e) The covenants contained in this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. 

   

 (f) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action so that the successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Law, each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.

Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all such filings and notifications, including by providing copies of all relevant documents to the non-filing party and its advisors before filing. No party shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

No party shall, or shall permit any of its Affiliates to, participate in any meeting or engage in any material substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. Parent shall advise the Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which Parent or any of its Affiliates proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Law as promptly as practicable. 

   

 (d) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to give reasonably prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to give reasonably prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (ii) of any action commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, arising from or relating to this Agreement or the Merger and other the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transaction Litigation_ "); provided, that (x) the Company and Parent shall give each other the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation and (y) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or Representative of the Company shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding, or offer or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same, other than any such compromise, settlement, arrangement or consent involving only the payment of damages not in

5.9(d), each partys disclosure obligations pursuant to this Section 5.9(d)
shall be subject to the limitations on, and requirements with respect to,

Except as provided for in this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing not later than the date the Closing is required to be effected in accordance with Section 1.2, on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitments (including the flex provisions) and to consummate the Rollover Investment pursuant to the Rollover Letter in accordance with the terms thereof, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing Commitments on terms and conditions (including flex provisions) no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Financing Commitments, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in the Financing Commitments (including definitive agreements related thereto) and the Rollover Letter within their control, including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Financing, and (iv) consummate the Financing and the Rollover Investment at or prior to the Closing Date (it being understood that it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger, for Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing, the Rollover Investment or any alternative financing). 

     ##### 

  

    

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding
sentence, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, take all actions reasonably necessary to (i) maintain in effect
the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letter and (ii) enforce all of its
rights under the Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements relating
thereto) and the Rollover Letter. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of
this Agreement, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates be obligated to commence any legal action against any Lender.
Parent shall keep the Company informed on a regular basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (including
providing the Company with copies of draft and definitive agreements and
other documents related to the Financing) and the Rollover Investment.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall
give the Company prompt notice (x) of any material breach or default by any
other party to any of the Financing Commitments, the Equity Commitment
Letter, the Rollover Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing
of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (y) of the receipt of (A) any
written notice or (B) other written communication, in each case from any
Person with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Commitments,
the Equity Commitment Letter, the Rollover Letter or definitive
agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing
Commitments, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Rollover Letter or definitive
agreements related to the Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Financing Commitments, the Equity
Commitment Letter, the Rollover Letter or definitive agreements related to the
Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount
of the Financing to be funded at the Closing or to consummate the Rollover
Investment or the amount of shares of Common Stock and Units to be
contributed on the Closing Date, and (z) if at any time for any reason Parent
or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Financing or the Rollover Investment on the terms and
conditions (including any market flex) contemplated by any of the Financing
Commitments, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Rollover Letter or
definitive agreements related the Financing. As soon as reasonably
practicable, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause
(x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence. Prior to the Closing,
Parent or Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, amend, modify, supplement or waive any of the conditions or
contingencies to funding contained in the Financing Commitments (or
definitive agreements related thereto) or the Rollover Letter, in each case,
to the extent such amendment, modification or supplement or waiver,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have the
effect of (A) adversely affecting the ability or likelihood of Parent or
Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) amending, modifying or supplementing the conditions or
contingencies to the Financing in a manner that makes it less likely the
Financing will be funded or imposing new or additional conditions or
expanding any existing condition to the receipt of the Financing; provided,
that Parent and Merger Sub may amend, modify, supplement, restate or replace
the Debt Financing or Debt Commitment Letter, in whole or in part, subject to
the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), with Parent or Merger Sub to promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification,
supplement, restatement or replacement. In the event all conditions applicable
to the Financing Commitments and/or the Rollover Letter have been satisfied,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders, Sponsor
and the Rollover Investors to fund the Financing and make the Rollover
Investment, as applicable, required to consummate the 

     ##### 

  

    

transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable. In the
event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, Parent shall
notify the Company and use its reasonable best efforts to arrange alternative
financing from the same or other sources of financing on terms and conditions
(including the economic terms, covenants, flex provisions and funding
conditions) no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained
in the Financing Commitments as of the date hereof (the " _Alternate Terms
and Conditions_ "), in an amount sufficient to replace such unavailable
Financing on the terms and conditions set forth herein or the Alternate Terms
and Conditions. For purposes of Section 5.12(a) and (b) and the definitions
of Compliant, Marketing Period and Required Information, references to (x)
"Debt Financing" and "Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended,
modified, supplemented, restated or replaced by this Section 5.12(a), any
debt securities or other financing to be issued or incurred in lieu of the
bridge facility in the Debt Commitment Letter and any alternative financing
required by this Section 5.12(a), (y) references to "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall include any amendment, modification, restatement, supplement
and replacement permitted by this Section 5.12(a) and any alternative
financing required by this Section 5.12(a), and (z) "Lenders" and "Financing
Sources" shall include lenders and other financing sources
(including underwriters, placement agents and initial purchasers) providing
the Debt Financing pursuant any amendment, modification, restatement,
supplement and replacement permitted by this Section 5.12(a) and any
alternative financing required by this Section 5.12(a). In the event that
Parent is required pursuant to this Section 5.12(a) to provide any
information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege, Parent
may withhold disclosure of such information to the extent that it complies,
_mutatis mutandis_ , with the last sentence of Section 5.3(a). 

   

 (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, at Parents sole cost and expense, use reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent, Merger Sub and their authorized Representatives in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, including (i) using reasonable best efforts to participate in a reasonable number of meetings, road show and investor presentations, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Financing on reasonable advance notice, including direct contact between senior management and representatives (including accounting) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Financing Sources, potential lenders and investors for the Financing, on the other hand, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to (A) provide to Parent and Merger Sub from time to time all information and disclosures regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by the Financing Sources and assisting with the preparation of appropriate and customary materials for rating agency presentations, offering and syndication documents (including private placement memoranda, lender and investor presentations and bank information memoranda), business projections and other marketing documents customarily required in connection with the Financing (all such documents and materials, collectively the " _Offering Documents_ ") and (B) identify any portion of any information contained in any Offering Documents that constitutes material non-public information, (iii) using reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent, Merger Sub and the Financing Sources with all Required Information, (iv) using reasonable best efforts to furnish all documentation and other information required by Governmental Entities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including U.S.A.

     ##### 

  

    

Financing Commitments or any definitive documentation relating to the
Financing to the extent the satisfaction of such conditions requires the
cooperation of, or is within the control of the Company, (vi)
using reasonable best efforts to issue customary representation letters to
auditors and using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining
corporate, credit, facility and securities ratings from rating agencies,
(vii) using reasonable best efforts to issue customary letters to the
Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information to prospective
lenders and making customary representations to the Financing Sources that
such information does not contain any untrue statement of any material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statements were made, not misleading, (viii) using
reasonable best efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral, (ix) using
reasonable best efforts to take corporate actions reasonably necessary to
permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds
thereof to be made available to the Company, including any high yield debt
financing, by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately upon the Effective
Time, (x) using reasonable best efforts to cooperate reasonably with the

or more credit agreements, indentures, purchase agreements, pledge
and security documents and other definitive financing documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent (including delivery of a solvency certificate
of the chief financial officer of the Company in the form contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter); _provided_ , that (A) the Company shall not be
required to become subject to any obligations or Liabilities with respect to
any agreements or documents under this clause (xii) prior to the Closing and
(B) nothing shall obligate the Company to provide any legal opinion or other
opinion of counsel, or any information that would, in its good faith opinion
after consultation with legal counsel, result in a violation of Law or loss
of attorney-client privilege; _provided_ , _further_ that any information
so withheld from disclosure shall be subject to the last sentence of Section
5.3(a). Parent shall, on demand, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
costs incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation. The Company and its Representatives shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any Offering Documents that are to be

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and its or their respective marks. Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives shall not incur any Liability to any Person under

therewith (other than information provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection therewith, or historical
financial information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries), except to

Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or their
respective Representatives.

effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, in each case, only if (a)
all conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing
(and which are, at the time that the Company seeks specific performance
pursuant to this Section 8.15, capable of being satisfied if the Closing were
to occur at such time) or the failure of which to be satisfied
is attributable primarily to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement), (b) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at
the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2
upon delivery of a drawdown notice by Parent and/or notice from Parent that
the Equity Financing and the Rollover Investment will be funded at such date,
(c) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (d) the Company
has confirmed in writing to Parent that all conditions set forth in
Section 6.3 have been satisfied or that it would be willing to waive any
unsatisfied conditions in Section 6.3 for purposes of consummating the Merger
and (e) such specific performance would result in the consummation of the
Merger in accordance with this Agreement substantially contemporaneously
with the consummation of the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing and the
Rollover Investment. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. In the event that a Chosen Court rules that Parent and/or
Merger Sub breached this Agreement in connection with their failure to effect
the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, but declines to enforce
specifically the obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub to draw down the full
proceeds of the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Equity Commitment Letter, to cause the Rollover Investment to be made
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Rollover Letter and/or to effect
the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, on the terms and subject to
the conditions in this Agreement, pursuant to a claim for specific
performance brought against Parent and/or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section
8.15, then, in addition to the right of the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(d) and collect the Parent Breach
Termination Fee, the Company shall have the right to be paid the Companys
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with all actions
to seek specific performance of Parent and Merger Subs obligations pursuant
to this Agreement and/or the Financing Commitments and all actions to collect
such fee or expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
exercise of the Companys right to seek specific performance pursuant to this
Section 8.15 reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the Companys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4 and be paid the applicable
Parent Termination Fee; _provided_ , that under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance of the consummation of the Merger pursuant to this Section 8.15
and the payment of all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.
