Section 2.4 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_ _._

 

(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a statement (the "
_Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers proposed
calculation of the Purchase Price and the components thereof, including (i) a

Companies as of the Closing and the related Net Working Capital Adjustment,
(ii) a proposed calculation of the actual amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents
of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing, and (iii) a proposed calculation
of the actual amount of Debt of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing, and,
in each case, the components thereof, together with reasonable supporting
detail. Buyer shall prepare the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement in
good faith in accordance with GAAP and Schedule C and shall cause it to be in
the same form and include the same line items as the Estimated Purchase Price
Statement.

 

(b) During the 30-day period following Sellers receipt of the Proposed Final
Purchase Price Statement, Sellers and their accountants and other
Representatives shall be permitted reasonable access to review the books and
records and other relevant information of the Acquired Companies during
regular business hours and such other good faith, reasonable cooperation
from Buyer and its personnel, accountants and advisors (including access to
the personnel, accountants and advisors of Buyer and the Acquired Companies)
as it may reasonably request to enable it to review and evaluate Buyers
determination of the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement; provided that
such review and evaluation shall only be upon reasonable notice, in compliance
with all applicable Laws, shall not unreasonably disrupt personnel and
operations of the Business and shall be at Sellers sole cost and expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 2.4(b) shall not require Buyer or
any Acquired Company to disclose any information that in the reasonable, good
faith judgment of Buyer would reasonably be expected to result in any
violation of any Law to which Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including any
Acquired Company) is subject to or cause any privilege (including attorney-
client privilege) which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including
any Acquired Company) would be entitled to assert to be undermined with
respect to such information and such undermining of such privilege would in
Buyers good faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel)
adversely affect in any material respect Buyers position in any pending or,
what Buyer believes in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
would reasonably be expected to be, future litigation; _provided_ that, in
such

AMENDED.



 

 cases the Parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow
disclosure of such information (including by entering into a joint-defense or
similar agreement) to the extent doing so would not (in the good faith belief
of Buyer) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such Law or
reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to
such information.

 

(c) If Sellers do not deliver a written notice of dispute setting forth in
reasonable detail the items and amounts in dispute (a " _Purchase Price
Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer within 30 days after receiving the Proposed Final
Purchase Price Statement, the Parties agree that the Proposed Final Purchase
Price Statement shall become final, binding and conclusive upon the Parties.
If Sellers deliver a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Buyer (the items and
amounts in dispute, the " _Disputed Purchase Price Items_ ") within such
30-day period, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve
the Disputed Purchase Price Items during the 30-day period commencing on the
date Buyer receives such Purchase Price Dispute Notice. If the Parties reach
agreement with respect to any Disputed Purchase Price Items within such 30-day
period, Buyer shall revise the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement to
reflect such agreement, which agreed items shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Parties. If the Parties do not obtain a final written
resolution of any Disputed Purchase Price Item within such 30-day period,
then the unresolved Disputed Purchase Price Items (the " _Unresolved Purchase
Price Items_ ") shall be submitted immediately to an internationally
recognized, independent accounting firm mutually agreed by the Parties (the "
_Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm, acting as expert and not as
arbitrator, shall be directed to render a determination regarding the
Unresolved Purchase Price Items within 30 days after referral of the matter
to the Accounting Firm (or as soon as practicable thereafter) which
determination must be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in
writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding
upon the Parties absent manifest error, and judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is to be enforced.

(d) The Accounting Firm shall make a determination only with respect to the
Unresolved Purchase Price Items, and in a manner consistent with this Section
2.4, and in no event shall the Accounting Firms determination of Unresolved
Purchase Price Items be for an amount outside the range of disagreement among
the Parties. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to
the Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information
pertaining to the Unresolved Purchase Price Items as the Accounting Firm may
request in connection with the performance of its work contemplated hereby.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne in the same
proportion as the aggregate dollar amount of the Unresolved Purchase Price
Items that are unsuccessfully disputed by each party (as finally determined by
the Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all of the
Unresolved Purchase Price Items submitted to the Accounting Firm.

(e) Buyer shall revise the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement to reflect
the determination of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.4. No
later than five Business Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4:

 

(i) if the Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall
pay or cause to be paid to Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds pursuant to wire instructions provided by Sellers to Buyer, an amount in
cash equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated
Purchase Price; and

 

(ii) if the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Purchase Price, Sellers shall
pay or cause to be paid to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds pursuant to wire instructions provided by Buyer to Sellers, an amount in
cash equal to the amount by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the
Purchase Price.

 

(f) The measurement time for purposes of calculating an Acquired Companys
actual amount of Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents and Debt as
of the Closing in accordance with Section 2.4 shall be 12:01 A.M. on the

Section 2.5 _Proceedings_. Except as otherwise specifically provided for
herein, all proceedings that will be taken and all documents that will be
executed and delivered by the Parties on the Closing Date will be deemed to
have been taken and executed simultaneously, and no proceeding will be deemed
taken nor any document executed and delivered until all such proceedings have
been taken, and all such documents have been executed and delivered.

Section 2.6 _Allocation of the Aggregate Purchase Price_. The Parties have
agreed to the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Interests, the
Purchased IP and among the other assets of the Acquired Companies as set forth
in Section 2.6 of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_
"), _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any material changes in the
balance sheets of the Acquired Companies between signing and Closing, the
Parties will adjust the allocation of the Purchase Price to the Interests to
the extent necessary to account for such changes (but in the event of any such
material change, in no event will the Purchase Price allocated to particular
Interests be less than the net book value of such Interests on the
Closing Date). Each Party will: (a) be bound by the Purchase Price Allocation
for purposes of determining any Taxes; (b) prepare and file, and cause its
Affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation; and (c) take no position, and cause its Affiliates
to take no position, inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation on any
applicable Tax Return or in any Action before any Tax Authority or otherwise.
In the event that the Purchase Price Allocation is disputed by any Tax
Authority, the Party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the
other Parties, and each Party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
defend such Purchase Price Allocation in any audit or similar Action.

(b) This Section 6.2 shall not require a Seller or any of its Affiliates to
permit any access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable,
good faith judgment of such Seller would reasonably be expected to result in
(i) any violation of any Contract or Law to which such Party or

respect such Partys position in any pending or, what such Party believes in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) would reasonably be
expected to be, future litigation or (ii) if such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the other or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, such information being
reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ that, in the cases of clause (i), the
Parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information (including by entering into a

 joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (A) would not (in
the good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose the
information) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such
Contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information or (B) would reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose the information
(after consultation with outside counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of the other Party shall be provided access to such
information.

 

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this Section 6.2
will (i) modify any of the representations and warranties of the Parties (or
operate as a waiver of such Partys rights for indemnification for a breach of
any representation or warranty), (ii) operate as a waiver of any condition set

Schedule.

(d) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreements are incorporated into this
Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the

Confidentiality Agreements shall terminate. If, for any reason, the Closing is
not consummated, the Confidentiality Agreements shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their respective terms.

(e) From and after the Closing, each of the Sellers shall, and shall cause
its respective Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to,
hold in confidence any and all confidential and proprietary information (other
than Non-Confidential Information), whether written or oral, to the extent
such information relates to any Acquired Company or to the Business;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 6.2(e) will prevent any
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives from using any
confidential and proprietary information (including Licensed Shared IP) to the
extent such information relates to Sellers, any Affiliate of a Seller (other
than an Acquired Company), the US Business or any other business (other than
the Business) of a Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives. From
and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives to, hold in confidence any and all
confidential and proprietary information (other than Non-Confidential
Information), whether written or oral, to the extent such information relates
to Sellers or to Sellers businesses (after giving effect to the consummation
of the Transactions); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this Section
6.2(e) will prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives from
using confidential and proprietary information (including Licensed Shared IP)
to the extent such information relates to an Acquired Company or the
Business. If a Party or any of its Affiliates or its or their respective
Representatives is compelled to disclose any such confidential and proprietary
information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law, or if it becomes necessary for such disclosing Party or any of its
Affiliates to disclose such information in connection with any Action, the
disclosing Party shall promptly notify the other Parties in writing and shall
disclose only that portion of such information as is necessary, and the
disclosing Party shall provide the other Parties with such appropriate
protective order or other reasonable assurance that such information will be
accorded confidential treatment as such other Parties may reasonably request.

challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law or which
would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, each Party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such objections or Actions so as to permit consummation
of the Transactions.

reasonably be expected to be, future litigation; _provided_ that, in such
cases the Parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure

reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to
such information.

respective Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) may grant to certain

agreement, would require Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Acquired
Company) to provide any more favorable terms of employment (including
compensation and benefits) to any Continuing Employee than those otherwise
provided for by this Section 6.10 (or extend the period of time for which the
standards set forth in this Section 6.10 are required to be met), then Buyer

limit the right of Buyer or its Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise
modify any such employee benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates (including

or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an
amendment to any such plan, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an
amendment to such plan even though not explicitly designated as such in this

retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect with respect thereto. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section
6.10 are included for the sole benefit of the Parties, and that nothing in

consent of Sellers. If Sellers so consent to such an election under Section
338(g), Buyer shall indemnify Sellers and their respective Affiliates for any
and all additional Taxes owed by any such Seller or Affiliate resulting
therefrom (as determined on a with and without basis by calculating the excess
of Sellers Tax liability including the effect of such election over Sellers

Affiliates shall be obligated to indemnify Buyer for any Taxes incurred as a

ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) make any Tax election that has
retroactive effect to any such Tax period (or portion thereof), or (iii)
settle or compromise any Tax Claim relating to any such Tax period (or portion
thereof), in each case, relating to any Acquired Company or Purchased IP. In
addition, without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit its
Affiliates or any of the Acquired Companies to take, fail to take, or delay
taking, any other action (including any action with respect to any of the
Acquired Companies that is treated as a foreign corporation for United States
federal income Tax purposes), in each case, that would reasonably be expected
to increase the liability for Taxes (including any obligation to indemnify
for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement) of a Seller or any of its Affiliates,
change the character of any income or gain that a Seller or any of its
Affiliates must report on a Tax Return, or result in a decrease of any

contrary herein, the Seller shall have the right to cause an election

Claim which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against Sellers, and
in any event within five Business Days after receiving notice of such Tax
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure by Buyer to timely notify
Sellers will not prevent Buyer from seeking any indemnification except to the
extent that Sellers are actually prejudiced by the delay.

(ii) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax period ending prior to
the Closing Date or that otherwise may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against Sellers (other than with respect to a Tax period
ending after the Closing Date, which shall be controlled by Buyer), Seller
shall have the right at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the defense
of such Tax Claim with counsel of its choice, at its sole expense; _provided_
, _however_ , that Sellers will not settle or compromise any Tax Claim
without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed) unless the proposed settlement
or compromise relates to a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior
to the Closing Date; and _provided_ further that Sellers shall indemnify
Buyer for any Taxes that arise in a Tax period ending after the Closing Date
(or the portion of such Tax period beginning after the Closing Date) as a
direct result of the settlement or compromise of such Tax Claim and such
indemnity shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue in full force and
effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of any
relevant Tax period affect by such settlement or compromise and shall not be
subject to the Minimum Claim Amount or other limitation on recover of Tax
Claims under this Agreement. With respect to any Tax Claim that Sellers elect
to assume the conduct of the defense of such Tax Claim, Sellers will keep
Buyer informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Pre-
Closing Tax Proceeding (including by providing copies of any notices and other
documents received from or submitted to any Tax Authority in respect thereof.

 applicable Affiliate shall do so on Buyers behalf as reasonably directed by

in any way limit RAI or JT or any of their respective controlled Affiliates
from:

(i) performing any of its obligations under any Transaction Document or
performing any contract manufacturing or other services at the request of or
otherwise on behalf of JT and its controlled Affiliates (in the case of RAI
and its controlled Affiliates) or RAI and its controlled Affiliates (in the
case of JT and its controlled Affiliates); 

(ii) performing any contract manufacturing services to any Person so long as

case of RAI and its controlled Affiliates) or the Business (in the case of JT
and its controlled Affiliates), in each case, in accordance with the terms of
the Transaction Documents;

 

(iv) owning or acquiring an investment of not more than 5% of the then-
outstanding capital stock of any publicly-held Person whose stock is traded

(d) Each of RAI and JT acknowledges and agrees that irreparable damage would
occur in the event of a violation of the provisions of this Section 6.19.
Each of RAI and JT further acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this Section 6.19 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the other Party
would not enter into this Agreement. If, at the time of enforcement of the
covenants contained in this Section 6.19 (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), a
court or arbitrator shall hold that the duration of the Restricted Period,
scope or area restrictions of the Restrictive Covenants are unreasonable or
otherwise unenforceable under circumstances then existing, RAI and JT agree
that such court or arbitrator shall be entitled to amend and substitute the
Restricted Period, scope or area as it determines is enforceable under such
circumstances for the stated duration, scope or area in the Restrictive
Covenants and that, in such case, the court or arbitrator shall be allowed
and directed to revise the Restrictive Covenants to cover the maximum period,
scope and area permitted by Law.

(e) Each Party agrees that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the Restrictive Covenants were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached for which money damages would be
inadequate, and in such case, the other Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Restrictive Covenants and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Restrictive Covenants,
in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in
equity, without the need to post a bond or other security and without the
necessity of proving damages. The rights and remedies provided by this Section
6.19 are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies that a
Party may have hereunder or at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if a Party or its controlled
Affiliates breaches the Restrictive Covenants and another Party seeks and
obtains an Order or other equitable relief from any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction, the five-year Restricted Period will be computed from
the date relief is granted to such Party instead of from the Closing Date and
reduced by any time following the Closing Date during which the breaching
Party complied with its obligations hereunder.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Restrictive
Covenants will only apply to RAI and JT and any Person that is a controlled
Affiliate of RAI or JT during the Restricted Period. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event either RAI or JT becomes a controlled Affiliate of any
Person, following such event, the Restrictive Covenants will (i) only apply
to RAI and its controlled Affiliates or JT or its controlled Affiliates, as
the case may be, at the time that RAI or JT, as applicable, becomes a
controlled Affiliate of such Person, and (ii) will not apply to any
Affiliates or Subsidiaries of such Person other than RAI and its controlled
Affiliates or JT or its controlled Affiliates, as the case may be, _provided_
, that in no event will any Licensed Shared IP be used during the Restricted
Period in contravention of the Restrictive Covenants.

 have not been satisfied as of the date of such termination, but all other
conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE VII have otherwise been satisfied
or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at Closing, but which conditions would have been satisfied if the

(iii) the agreements contained in this Section 8.2(b) are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements,
Sellers would not enter into this Agreement and the Parties expressly
acknowledge and agree that in the event that Sellers are paid the Termination

penalty, but shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all Losses
suffered or incurred by Sellers.

(d) Any claim made under this ARTICLE IX shall be reduced in amount by any Tax
benefit actually received with respect to such claim or as a result of the
circumstances giving rise to such claim. The Parties agree that any
indemnification payments made under this ARTICLE IX shall be treated for all
Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

(e) Each Indemnitee will mitigate all Losses for which such Indemnitee
is entitled or may be entitled to indemnification hereunder to the extent
required by New York Law in connection with a breach of contract. An
Indemnitee will use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue available
coverage under insurance policies maintained by such Indemnitee for any
Losses otherwise subject to indemnity hereunder. If an Indemnitee actually
receives any insurance proceeds pursuant to indemnification or otherwise prior
to being indemnified with respect to Losses under this ARTICLE IX, the
payment under this ARTICLE IX with respect to such Losses shall be reduced by
the amount of such insurance proceeds or other recoveries actually received,
in each case, net of any costs and expenses (including reasonable fees
and expenses of attorneys), deductibles or retentions (such net amount, a "
_Net Recovery_ "). If an Indemnitee actually receives any insurance proceeds
pursuant to indemnification or otherwise after being indemnified with respect
to all or a portion of any Losses under this ARTICLE IX, the Indemnitee shall
pay to the Indemnitor who made such payment the lesser of (i) the amount of
the Net Recovery with respect to such Losses and (ii) the amount paid by such
Indemnitor to the to the Indemnitee with respect to such Losses.

(f) No Indemnitor shall be required to make any payment hereunder in respect
of any Losses which are contingent until the time that such contingent Losses
cease to be contingent and no Indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this ARTICLE IX for any punitive or exemplary damages (other than
punitive or exemplary damages paid by the Indemnitee to a third party in
connection with a Third Party Claim. Any amounts payable pursuant to the
indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE IX shall be paid without
duplication, and in no event shall any Party be indemnified under different
provisions of this Agreement for the same Losses (including for the avoidance
of doubt any amounts taken into account in the calculation of Net Working
Capital). Notwithstanding anything in this ARTICLE IX to the contrary, no
claim for indemnification may be made and no Seller shall be liable under or
in respect of any claim for indemnification: (i) if the circumstances giving
rise to such claim or the Losses with respect to such claim have been (A)
disclosed on the face of the Business Financial Information or (B) have been
previously taken into account in the calculation of the Estimated Purchase
Price or Purchase Price; or (ii) to the extent that it arises or is increased
as a result of by or on behalf of, with the express consent or at the request
of Buyer or its Affiliates.

(g) To the extent a Buyer Indemnitee (i) has suffered an indemnifiable Loss
pursuant to Section 9.1(a) in respect of breaches of any representation or
warranty contained in (A) the first sentence of Section 4.3(c) (Subsidiaries),
(B) Section 4.4 (Financial Information), (C) the first sentence of Section
4.6(b) (Sufficiency and Title to Tangible Assets) or (D) Section 4.7(a)
(Absence of Certain Changes), but the particular Seller or Sellers obligated
to indemnify such Buyer Indemnitee for such Loss, or the extent to which
it cannot be determined which Seller is obligated to provide any such
indemnification, or (ii) would be entitled to indemnification under Section
9.1(a) if such representations and warranties of the Sellers had been made on
a joint and several basis, then, in each such case under (i) and (ii), such
Buyer Indemnitee shall, subject to the limitations set forth herein, be
permitted to seek indemnification directly from RAI pursuant to Section
10.17(a).

 

Section 9.4 _Notice of Claims_. If any of the Persons to be indemnified under
this ARTICLE IX (any such Person, an " _Indemnitee_ ") has suffered or
incurred any Loss, such Person shall so notify the Party from whom
indemnification is sought (such Party, the " _Indemnitor_ ") promptly in
writing describing the event giving rise to such Loss, the basis upon which
indemnity is being sought, the amount or estimated amount of the Loss, if
known or reasonably capable of estimation, and the method of computation of
such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to
the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Loss shall have
occurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that no failure to give timely or complete
notice on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying the Indemnitor shall relieve
the Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnitor is actually materially prejudiced thereby.

Section 9.5  _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

(a) If any claim or demand is made against an Indemnitee with respect to any
matter, or any Indemnitee shall otherwise learn of an assertion or of a
potential claim, by any Person who is not a Party (or an Affiliate thereof) (a
" _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification
against an Indemnitor under this Agreement, then the Indemnitee shall
promptly notify the applicable Indemnitor of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in
notifying the Indemnitor will relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation
hereunder unless the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced as a result thereof.

(b) The Indemnitor shall have the right, at its option and expense, to assume
the defense of any Third Party Claim with its own counsel by delivering
written notice to the Indemnitee; _provided_ , _however_ , that Indemnitor
shall not have the right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim that
involves criminal allegations or in any manner involves any injunctive or
equitable relief against the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates that, if
successful, would reasonably be expected to permanently adversely affect
the Indemnitee, any of its Affiliates or the Business or US Business, as the
case may be, in any material respect. If the Indemnitor elects to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim as set forth in this Section 9.5(b), then:

(i) Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in such defense with
counsel of its own choosing, _provided_ that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall not be required to
pay or otherwise indemnify the Indemnitee against any attorneys fees incurred
by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim
following the Indemnitors written election to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnitee reasonably shall have concluded (upon
advice of its outside counsel) that, with respect to such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor have different, conflicting, or adverse
legal positions, defenses or interests, and in such case, the Indemnitee shall
be entitled to participate in such defense with counsel of its own choosing,
and the Indemnitor shall be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the
Indemnitee against attorneys fees incurred by the Indemnitee;

 

(ii) the Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnitor all books, records
and other documents and materials that are under the direct or indirect
control of the Indemnitee and that the Indemnitor reasonably considers
necessary or desirable for the defense of such Third Party Claim;

 

(iii) the Indemnitee shall otherwise cooperate at the Indemnitors sole cost
and expense as reasonably requested by the Indemnitor in the defense of such
Third Party Claim;

(iv) the Indemnitee shall not admit in writing any Liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim; and

(v) the Indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnitee,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnification may be
sought hereunder or consent to the entry of any judgment (A) which does not,
to the extent that the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates may have any
Liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, include as an unconditional
term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a
written unconditional full release of the Indemnitee and its Affiliates from
all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (B) which includes any
statement as to or an admission of fact, culpability or a failure to act, by
or on behalf of the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or (C) which in any
manner involves any injunctive or equitable relief against the Indemnitee or
any of its Affiliates.

 

(c) If the Indemnitor is not entitled to or elects not to assume the defense
of any Third Party Claim, then with respect to such Third Party Claim, the
applicable Indemnitor will have the same rights and obligations as the
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9.5(b), and the applicable Indemnitee will have
the same rights and obligations as the Indemnitor pursuant to Section 9.5(b).

IX), indemnification for any Taxes or matter regarding Taxes shall be governed
solely under Section 6.11. For the avoidance of doubt, except as provided in

period, under or by reason of under or in respect of this Agreement. 

Section 10.2 _Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted

the Interests, Purchased IP or other rights or property set out in the
designation (and any reference to "Buyer" herein in connection therewith shall
automatically be deemed to be a reference to such Designated Buyer) and such
Designated Buyer shall automatically be assigned the rights of Buyer under
this Agreement necessary in connection with such designation.

(a) All Exhibits, Schedules and the Disclosure Schedule attached hereto are
hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Any matter
disclosed pursuant to any Section of the Disclosure Schedule (or in any
section of any Schedule or Exhibit to the Disclosure Schedule) whose relevance
or applicability to any representation or warranty made elsewhere in this

reference thereto.

the Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall
be deemed an admission by a Party that such item is required to be so included
in a Schedule or in the Disclosure Schedule or represents an exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely
to result in a Material Adverse Effect or that such item is outside the
ordinary course of business.

to any Liability to Buyer resulting from the distribution to Buyer or its

Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure

any prior understandings, negotiations, agreements, discussions
or representations among the Parties of any nature, whether written or oral,
to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof.

 

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void
or unenforceable in any respect, all other provisions of this Agreement, or
the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other
than those as to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable, shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and will in
no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination
that any provision, or the application of any such provision, is invalid,
illegal, void or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the

dollars, be deemed to be a reference to an equivalent amount in U.S. dollars

money damages would be inadequate and it is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches

and collectively, the " _Seller Group Members_ ") have a reasonable
expectation that, after the Closing, Jones Day will represent them in
connection with any claim or Action involving any Seller Group Member, on the
one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates and Representatives (each a "
_Buyer Group Member_ " and collectively the " _Buyer Group Members_ "), on the
other hand, arising under or relating to this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document or the Transactions. Buyer, on its own behalf and on
behalf of the other Buyer Group Members, hereby expressly waives and agrees

 and on behalf of the other Seller Group Members, hereby expressly waives and
agrees not to assert any conflict of interest that may arise or be deemed to

them in connection with any claim or Action arising under or relating to this

(c) Each Party irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the
Closing, any attorney-client privilege arising from communications prior to
the Closing between any one or more Representatives of the Acquired Companies,
on the one hand, and Jones Day, on the other hand, to the extent related to
this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the Transactions, shall be
excluded from the property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and other
interests held by any Acquired Company under applicable Law, that such
attorney-client privilege shall be deemed held solely by Sellers, and that no
Buyer Group Member shall have any right to assert, waive or otherwise alter
any such attorney-client privilege at any time after the Closing. All
communications involving attorney-client confidences between the Seller Group
Members and the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and Jones Day, on the
other hand, to the extent relating to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the Transactions or any alternative thereto shall be deemed to

Members shall not have access to any such communications or to the files of
Jones Day relating to such engagement. Further, to the extent that files of
Jones Day in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client,
only Sellers for the benefit and on behalf of the Seller Group Members (and
not the Buyer Group Members) shall hold such property rights and Jones Day
shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Buyer Group Members by reason of any attorney-
client relationship between Jones Day and the Acquired Companies.

(d) The Parties hereby agree to, and to cause any Buyer Group Member or Seller
Group Member, as applicable, to, execute any document or instrument
reasonably requested from time to time by the other Party in order to evidence
or effectuate the intentions of the Parties reflected in this Section 10.16.

Day, on the one hand, and the Buyer Group Members and Freshfields, on the
other hand, and each such Person is an intended third-party beneficiary of
this Section 10.16. This Section 10.16 shall be irrevocable, and no term of
this Section 10.16 may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior
written consent of the Parties.

Party_ ") or, in each case, by or to an Affiliate thereof, in connection with
this Agreement and future collaboration meetings, the Receiving Party (a)
will keep the Confidential Information confidential using the same safeguards
and standard of care that it uses to preserve the confidentiality of its own

the Disclosing Party, disclose any Confidential Information in any manner
whatsoever and (b) will not use any Confidential Information other than in
connection with the Business or the US Business or in fulfilling any other
obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Receiving
Party may reveal the Confidential Information to its Representatives (i) who
need to know the Confidential Information for the purposes of providing or
receiving the Services, as applicable, or for fulfilling any other obligations
of the Receiving Party hereunder, (ii) who are informed by the Receiving Party

 breach of this _Section 4.01_ by any of its Representatives. For the
avoidance of doubt, any materials, documents, programs, data or information
provided by one Party to the other Party pursuant to the terms of the
Purchase Agreement shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of the
Purchase Agreement and shall not be subject to the confidentiality provisions
of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.02. _Use and Disclosure Limitations_. The obligation of
confidentiality under this _ARTICLE IV_ (Confidentiality) will not apply to
the extent that it can be established by the Receiving Party by competent
proof that such Confidential Information:

(a) was already known to or in the possession of the Receiving Party, other
than under an obligation of confidentiality, at the time of receipt from the
Disclosing Party;

 

(b) was generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public
domain at the time of its receipt from the Disclosing Party;

 

(c) became generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public
domain after its disclosure other than through any act or omission of the
Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement;

(d) was received by the Receiving Party, other than under an obligation
of confidentiality, from a third Person lawfully in possession of the
Confidential Information that was itself free from any restrictions on use or
obligations of confidentiality with respect to such Confidential Information;
or

 

(e) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference or
access to any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. 

Section 4.03. _Required Disclosure_. In the event disclosure of Confidential
Information is permitted by applicable Law and is compelled by judicial or
administrative process or required by operation of Law, the Receiving Party
will promptly notify the Disclosing Party and otherwise cooperate, at the
Disclosing Partys expense, with the Disclosing Party so that the Disclosing
Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in the
Disclosing Partys sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this
_ARTICLE IV_ (Confidentiality). In the event that no such protective order
or other remedy is obtained, or that the Disclosing Party does not waive
compliance with the terms of this _ARTICLE IV_ (Confidentiality), the
Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information
that it is advised by counsel is legally required and will exercise all
reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded the Confidential Information.

inventory levels are unavailable and the remainder of the Purchase Order will
be filled); (ii) the Manufacturer is not prepared to manufacture the Products
due to a change in the Specifications; (iii) the production of the Products
would, in the Manufacturers good faith belief, violate any applicable Law or

violate the Manufacturers policy regarding stewardship of products that it
distributes for commercial sale; (v) the Manufacturer would be obligated to
supply Products to a location outside of the Territory; or (vi) a Force

(a) The Manufacturer will ship Products on a first in / first out basis as

Products until they pass the ships rail or planes fuselage.

 

(b) The Products will be shipped into the Territory by reputable commercial
common carriers selected and contracted by either the Manufacturer or the
Customer, as determined by the Customer. The Manufacturer will arrange for

 instructed by the Customer, and (ii) be adequate to withstand the normal
rigors of transfer, storage and distribution, and prevent damage and/or
deterioration of Products prior to arrival at the specified destination.

(d) The Manufacturer will be responsible for obtaining all applicable Export
Licenses.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Customer
will pay all costs (including insurance costs) relating to shipment
(including inland freight to point of export), delivery and receipt of the
Products, as well as all export and import taxes, duties and similar charges,
as applicable.

 

5.2 _Title Transfer; Risk of Loss_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, title to, and risk of loss for, the Products will pass to
the Customer as soon as they pass the ships rail or planes fuselage with the
commercial common carrier.

 

5.3 _Inspection and Approval of Products; Rejection of Non-Conforming
Products_. Upon receipt of the Products at the port of import in the
Territory (" _Receipt_ "), the Customer will have the right to inspect and
approve for acceptance those Products. Such inspection and approval must be
made promptly after Receipt (and, in any event, within 21 days of Receipt).
The Customer will have the right to reject Products that are Non-Conforming
Products and call attention to other deficiencies in deliveries by informing
the Manufacturer in writing within the 21-day inspection period, which notice
must include information about the nature and extent of the reasons why the
Products should be characterized as Non-Conforming Products and include the
results of any control or quality tests performed by the Buyer that indicate
the Products are Non-Conforming Products. If the Customer fails to timely
notify the Manufacturer of the Customers rejection of the Products, the
Customer will be deemed to have accepted those Products as conforming. The
Customer may only reject and refuse acceptance of Products that are Non-
Conforming Products. Within 21 days after receiving such a notice, the
Manufacturer may contest the rejection and provide documentation and other
evidence relating to the quality of the applicable Products. The Manufacturer
may also inspect the Products and collect a representative sample thereof for
testing and analysis. Thereafter, the Parties will confer in good faith to
resolve the controversy. If any Products are finally deemed to be Non-
Conforming Products, they will be destroyed or otherwise handled pursuant to
the Customers instructions, at no cost to the Customer. The Customer will not
be responsible for any payment for Non-Conforming Products (and in the event
that the Customer has paid for those Non-Conforming Products, the Customer
will be entitled, at the Customers election, to a credit for or refund of
that payment). If the Customer requests that the Manufacturer replace or
correct any Non-Conforming Products, the Manufacturer will be responsible for
promptly remanufacturing, substituting or otherwise correcting those Non-
Conforming Products, and for supplying remanufactured or corrected Products at
no cost to the Customer.

receiving Confidential Information (a " _Receiving Party_ ") will maintain in

with respect to another Partys Trade Secrets, including the

PORTIONS OF THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY *****, HAVE BEEN REDACTED AND HAVE BEEN

 Specifications, will be perpetual. No Party will use, disclose or grant the
use of such Confidential Information except as expressly authorized by this
Agreement. To the extent that disclosure is authorized by this Agreement, the
Receiving Party must inform its employees, representatives and contracting
parties to whom disclosure is to be made of this _ARTICLE 7_ , and instruct
such Persons to hold in confidence and not make use of such information for
any purpose other than those purposes permitted by this Agreement. Each
Receiving Party will use at least the same standard of care (but not less than
a reasonable standard of care) as it uses to protect its own proprietary and
Trade Secret information to ensure that such employees, representatives and
contracting parties do not disclose or make any unauthorized use of such
Confidential Information. Each Receiving Party will promptly notify the other
upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential
Information. The Receiving Party will be responsible to the Disclosing Party
for any loss of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party or breach of
the provisions of this _Section 7.1_ by any employee, representative or
contracting party of the Receiving Party.

7.2 _Exceptions_. The obligations of confidentiality contained in _Section
7.1_ will not apply to the extent that it can be established by the Receiving
Party by competent evidence that such Confidential Information: (a) was
generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain at
the time of its receipt from the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes generally
available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain after its
disclosure and other than through any act or omission of the Receiving Party
in breach of this Agreement; or (c) was received by the Receiving Party, other
than under an obligation of confidentiality, by a third Person lawfully in
possession of the information.

 

7.3 _Authorized Disclosure_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party (nor
third Persons, as applicable) will be precluded from disclosing Confidential
Information to the extent it is required to do so in response to a valid order
by a Governmental Authority, or to the extent it reasonably believes, on the
basis of advice from outside counsel, that it is required to disclose such
Confidential Information by Law, or to the extent necessary to establish its
rights under this Agreement; _provided_ that, in the event a Party believes it
is so required to disclose another Partys Confidential Information, it
will promptly provide notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party
may seek an appropriate order or other action as it deems appropriate to
prevent or limit such disclosure, and the Party required to make the
disclosure will use its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of
the other Partys Confidential Information, including by cooperating with the
other Party to obtain an appropriate order or other reliable assurance of
confidential treatment. In any event, the Party required to make the
disclosure may disclose only that portion of another Partys Confidential
Information that is legally required to be disclosed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Party (or an Affiliate of such Party) is required
to include a copy of this Agreement as an exhibit to any current or periodic
report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, such Party (or
its Affiliate) may make such filing without the prior written consent of any
other Party as long as it seeks (or causes its Affiliate to seek)
confidential treatment of any portions of this Agreement that, in the opinion
of such filing Party, contain confidential or competitively sensitive
information, regardless of whether such treatment is obtained.

cure (a) will not apply to any breach by any Party involving violation of any
applicable Law, Governmental Approval or any breach that is not capable of

8.6 _Termination for Interference or Frustration of Purpose_. If both (a) the
action of any Governmental Authority prohibits or declares unlawful or
otherwise impairs, inhibits or frustrates in any material respect (i) the
Customers intended use of the Products being manufactured for it under this
Agreement, (ii) the Manufacturers ability to manufacture or package Products
as required under this Agreement, or (iii) any other material obligation of a
Party as contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) the Parties are unable to
propose a feasible way of either avoiding such interference or of
reorganizing the Parties arrangements under this Agreement so as to eliminate

(a) Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, this Agreement will terminate and become void and of no further
force and effect, and there will be no further liability or obligation on the
part of any Party hereto. Each Partys right of termination under _Sections
8.4_ , _8.5_ , and _8.6_ , is in addition to any other rights it may have
under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination
will not constitute an election of remedies and will not relieve any Party of

(i) the Manufacturer agrees to: (A) deliver all finished Products to the
Customer, together with a final invoice therefor; (B) return all of the

will not be required to purchase any such raw materials or product components

8.5_, or (ii) to the extent they (A) are in quantities in excess of those
required to manufacture Products in accordance with the Forecast, (B) were
not stored under proper conditions, or (C) were not managed on a first in /
first out basis. The Manufacturer will provide such raw materials and product
components for Cost and, upon payment therefor, the Manufacturer will deliver

all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added,
excise and other such taxes and fees (including any penalties) imposed in
connection with the purchase of Products from the Manufacturer (if any) will
be borne and paid by the Customer when due. To the extent applicable, the
Parties will cooperate with one another in good faith to obtain any tax
exemption certificates that would eliminate or mitigate any obligations to pay
any such taxes. The Products are intended for export outside of the United
States and, accordingly, the Parties intend that no federal or state excise
taxes (if any) will be payable with respect to the Products; however, in the
event any such federal or state excise taxes are levied with respect to the
Products, the Customer will be responsible for the payment thereof when due
and will indemnify the Manufacturer in the event any such taxes are levied
against it.

 

9.2 _Further Assurances_. Each Party agrees to enter into or execute, or
procure the entering into or execution, of such agreements, assignments or
further assurances, or do such other acts as any other Party may reasonably
request to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

9.3 _Relationship of the Parties_. For purposes of this Agreement, the Parties
will be and remain independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be
construed as establishing a general agency, employment, partnership, joint
venture, coalition, alliance or any other similar relationship between the
Parties with regards to the relationship created by this Agreement.
In accordance with this Agreement, no Party will have the authority to make
any statements, representations or commitments of any kind (whether express or
implied) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, or to take any
action, which would be binding on any other Party or create any liability or
obligation on behalf of any other Party regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement, without the prior written authorization of such other Party to do
so. No Party will have the right to direct or control the employees of any
other Party. No Party will be liable for the debts, obligations or other
liabilities of any other Party or of any of its agents, employees or
contractors, including any costs for salaries, benefits or taxes. 

9.4 _Force Majeure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no Party will be liable for any loss, injury, delay, damage or
other casualty suffered by any other Party due to any inability to perform any
obligation hereunder, and no Party will be deemed to have defaulted under or
breached this Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any
term or provision of this Agreement (other than payment of monies due), when
such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes beyond the control
of the affected Party, including

(whether war be declared or not), acts of terrorism, insurrection, riot, civil
commotion, labor dispute, or acts, omissions or delays in acting by any

police or any other official governmental acts). In the case of any delay or
failure that a Party anticipates will cause an excusable delay hereunder, such
Party will inform the other Party by written notice of the anticipated effect
of such delay within ten days of becoming aware of it.

9.5 _Parties in Interest_. Except for the Manufacturer Indemnified Parties
and the Customer Indemnified Parties, nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, will be construed to give any Person, including any
employee or former employee of either Party, other than the Parties or their
respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right,
remedy, claim or benefit or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of under or in respect of this Agreement.

 

9.6 _Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No
Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations hereunder without the express prior written consent of the other
Party, and any attempted assignment, without such consent, will be null
and void; _provided_ that the Customer may assign its rights to a subsidiary
of the Customer upon written notice of the same to the Manufacturer, which
assignment will not relieve the Customer of any of its obligations hereunder.

 

9.7 _Notices_. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, day-to-day
commercial communications, such as Purchase Orders, may be exchanged by any
reasonable means. All other notices, requests, demands and other

 _SUPPLIES TO RESTRICTED COUNTRIES_

 

 _U. S. International Trade Laws_

 

 _ _List of Prohibited Countries__

U.S. export control laws and regulations impose a general embargo on trade
with, exports to, transshipments through, and financial transactions involving
the following Prohibited Countries: Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan, and Myanmar
(Burma) (collectively, "Prohibited Countries"). The Customer acknowledges
that this list of Prohibited Countries changes on an irregular basis, and the
Customer agrees that it is responsible for regular monitoring of changes in
this list of Prohibited Countries. Other, more limited U.S. trade embargoes
also exist and the Customer agrees that it is responsible for complying with
all aspects of these embargoes as described more fully on the internet site
at:  _http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/_.

__Denied Parties__

 

U.S. export controls also prohibit exports to and financial transactions with
individuals, companies and organizations identified on a list of Denied
Parties specifically identified as "Specially Designated Nationals" (SDN),
published by OFAC at (http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/sdn/
index.html). Moreover, the Department of Commerce also publishes
"Denied Parties," "Entities" and "Unverified Parties" lists of companies and
individuals who are prohibited from involvement in U.S. export or re-export
transactions _(http://www.bxa.doc.gov/_ ). Each of the lists identified above
is updated on an irregular, but sometimes frequent, basis, and the Customer
agrees that it is responsible for regular monitoring of changes in these lists
and compliance with requirements not to export to or conduct financial
transactions with any entity identified on these lists without an export
license obtained from the U.S. government.

__Anti-boycott Laws__

 

The U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service enforce
Anti-boycott Laws and regulations that prohibit cooperation with foreign
embargoes that are not endorsed by the U.S. government. The U.S. Anti-boycott
Laws are aimed particularly at preventing cooperation with the Arab League
boycott of Israel. These laws prohibit agreements to cooperate with such
boycotts and actions to support such boycotts. These laws also require
reporting to the U.S. government of operations in countries enforcing such
embargoes and reporting of certain requests to cooperate with such embargoes.
The Customer agrees that it will strictly comply with the requirements of
Anti-boycott Laws and regulations.

obligations of confidentiality with respect to such Confidential Information;
or

waive compliance with the terms of this _ARTICLE III_  (Confidentiality). In
the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or that
Seller does not waive compliance with the terms of this _ARTICLE III_
(Confidentiality), Buyer will cause such Person will furnish only

of the other Parties, and any attempted assignment, without such consent, will

rights to an Affiliate upon written notice of the same to the other Party,

obligations hereunder, (b) Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement in

ARTICLE 3

 

 _PURCHASE COMMITMENTS_

 

3.1 _Core Tobacco Leaf_. Commencing with the 2017 Crop Year and continuing
with respect to each Crop Year during the Term thereafter, the Buyer agrees
to provide the Supplier with a binding purchase commitment for its projected
volumes of Core Tobacco Leaf from such Crop Year (including volumes, types and
grades of such Core Tobacco Leaf and whether any such Core Tobacco Leaf will
be purchased as Green Leaf) not later than (i) November 1, 2016 with respect
to the 2017 Crop Year, or (ii) the immediately preceding November 1 with
respect to any subsequent Crop Year (each, a " _Core Tobacco Leaf Commitment_
"). Subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section 3.3_ , the Buyer agrees to
purchase from the Supplier the amount of Core Tobacco Leaf reflected in each
Core Tobacco Leaf Commitment. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyers
purchase of Core Tobacco Leaf pursuant to the _Section 3.1_ , will not include
any Core Tobacco Leaf procured by the Supplier and used by it to manufacture
cigarette brands, brand styles, roll-your-own and blended strip products on
behalf of the Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to the CMA.

3.2 _Additional Tobacco Leaf_. Commencing with the 2017 Crop Year and
continuing with respect to each Crop Year during the Term thereafter, the
Buyer may (but will not be obligated to) participate in the Additional Tobacco
Leaf Program to procure Additional Tobacco Leaf. If the Buyer elects
to participate in the Additional Tobacco Leaf Program with respect to the
2017 Crop Year or any subsequent Crop Year during the Term, then the Buyer
must notify the Supplier of such election, in writing, no later than (a)
November 1, 2016 with respect to the 2017 Crop Year, or (b) the immediately
preceding November 1 with respect to any subsequent Crop Year, which notice
must include the Buyers binding purchase commitment for its requested volumes
of Additional Tobacco Leaf from such Crop Year (including types or grades of
such Additional Tobacco Leaf and whether any such Additional Tobacco Leaf will
be purchased as Green Leaf), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Supplier (each, an " _Additional Tobacco Leaf Commitment_ "). Subject to
adjustment as set forth in _Section 3.3_ , the Buyer agrees to purchase from
the Supplier the amount of Additional Tobacco Leaf reflected in each
Additional Tobacco Leaf Commitment.

3.3 _Adjustment_. The Parties acknowledge that tobacco farming is subject to
elements outside of either Partys or any farmers reasonable control,
including environmental and weather conditions and other events of Force
Majeure and, consequently, the yield of Core Tobacco Leaf or Additional
Tobacco Leaf may be materially different from the yields projected or
anticipated by either Party or the assumptions relied upon by the Buyer in
submitting its Core Tobacco Leaf Commitment or Additional Tobacco Leaf
Commitment. Based on the foregoing, the Buyers Core Tobacco Leaf
Commitment and Additional Tobacco Leaf Commitment (if any)

 with respect to each Crop Year will automatically adjust, without any action
on the part of either Party, to reflect the final yields of Core Tobacco Leaf
and Additional Tobacco Leaf from each Crop Year such that the Buyer is
obligated to purchase the same proportion of Core Tobacco Leaf and Additional
Tobacco Leaf as it would have been obligated to purchase had such yields
remained unchanged under the Suppliers and its Affiliates original
commitments and contracts therefor; _provided_ that no Additional Tobacco Leaf
Commitment may be adjusted to reflect an increase in Additional Tobacco Leaf
yield by more than ten percent (10%) from that reflected in the Buyers
original Additional Tobacco Leaf Commitment, and any increase in such yield
beyond such limitation will be allocated to the Suppliers and its Affiliates
commitments and contracts for such Additional Tobacco Leaf.

 

3.4 _Excess Tobacco Leaf_. On or before the expiration or earlier termination
of the CMA, the Supplier will evaluate the level of Core Tobacco Leaf and
Additional Tobacco Leaf expected to be in the Suppliers inventory at that
time, and offer the Buyer the option to purchase any such inventory the
Supplier does not elect to use in its other activities. If the Buyer
elects to accept any such offer, then it must notify the Supplier in writing
within 30 days after receipt of the offer and the purchase and sale will take
place in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

3.5 _Acknowledgement_. The Buyer acknowledges that the Supplier and its
Affiliates will be relying on each Core Tobacco Leaf Commitment and
Additional Tobacco Leaf Commitment in making their own commitments and
contracts with farmers and other sources of Core Tobacco Leaf and Additional
Tobacco Leaf and, accordingly, the Buyer may not cancel or modify any Core
Tobacco Leaf Commitment or Additional Tobacco Leaf Commitment without the
prior written consent of the Supplier, which may be granted or withheld in the
Suppliers sole discretion.

 

3.6 _Traceability_. Upon request from the Buyer, the Supplier will furnish the
Buyer with a report reasonably tracing the Tobacco Leaf back to the farmer or
other third party supplier.

3.7 _Projected Costs and Storage Charges_. Upon the Buyers request (made at
least ten business days before the relevant November 1), the Supplier will
provide the Buyer with an estimate of the Costs and Storage Costs associated
with the Buyers anticipated Core Tobacco Leaf Commitment and/or Additional
Tobacco Leaf Commitment for the relevant Crop Year, in each case, based on the
Suppliers good faith assumptions and projections and used solely for
illustrative purposes. No such estimate will, or will be deemed to, affect
the actual Costs and Storage Charges payable by the Buyer with respect to any
such Core Tobacco Leaf Commitment and/or Additional Tobacco Leaf Commitment.

(b) an amount equal to (x) the Cost of Such Tobacco Leaf, _multiplied by_ (y)
the Applicable Margin, _plus_

 

(c) Storage Charges, but only with respect to each full calendar month elapsed

accordance with _Section 5.1_ ( _e.g._ , no Storage Charges would be included

31).

payments will be made, without set off, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by the Supplier on its invoices or
otherwise. All payments will be made in U.S. dollars. All payments made by
the Buyer in respect of Tobacco Leaf will be deemed made without prejudice to
any rights that the Buyer may have under this Agreement, and will not
constitute acceptance of Tobacco Leaf or otherwise affect the Buyers rights
with respect to Non-Conforming Tobacco Leaf.

AMENDED.



 

 The Party contracting with the commercial common carrier will arrange for
shipment and delivery, but the Supplier will prepare all necessary shipping
documentation relating to such Tobacco Leaf (including documentation required
by the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau). Such shipping
documentation will comply with all applicable Laws. With respect to Tobacco
Leaf to be shipped into the Territory, (i) the Supplier will be listed as the
shipper of such Tobacco Leaf on corresponding export bills of lading, as well
as the "principal party in interest" for export declaration reporting
purposes, and (ii) Buyer will assist the Supplier in obtaining copies of all
documents evidencing proof of export within 60 days after the risk of loss
transfers to the Buyer in accordance with _Section 5.2_.

 

(c) The Supplier will be responsible for proper packing of the Tobacco Leaf.
All such packing and packing materials must (i) comply with handling, weight
and safety requirements, in each case, in accordance with the Specifications
or, if not addressed by the Specifications, as reasonably instructed by the
Buyer, and (ii) be adequate to withstand the normal rigors of
transfer, storage and distribution, and prevent damage, infestation and/or
deterioration of such Tobacco Leaf prior to arrival at the specified
destination.

 

(d) The Supplier will be responsible for obtaining all applicable Export
Licenses with respect to Tobacco Leaf to be shipped into the Territory.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer will
pay all costs (including insurance costs) relating to shipment (including
inland freight to point of export), delivery and receipt of the Tobacco Leaf,
as well as all export and import taxes, duties and similar charges, as
applicable.

 

5.2 _Title Transfer; Risk of Loss_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, title to, and risk of loss for, the Tobacco Leaf will pass
to the Buyer when the Supplier puts the Tobacco Leaf in the hands of the
initial commercial common carrier; _except_ that, if the Tobacco Leaf is to be
shipped into the Territory, title to, and risk of loss will pass to the Buyer
when the Tobacco Leaf passes the ships rail or planes fuselage.

5.3 _Inspection and Approval; Rejection of Non-Conforming Tobacco Leaf_. Upon
receipt of the Tobacco Leaf at the port of import (for shipments into the
Territory) or the initial destination point (for shipments in the U.S.) ("
_Receipt_ "), the Buyer will have the right to inspect and approve for
acceptance such Tobacco Leaf. Such inspection and approval must be made
promptly after Receipt (and, in any event, within 21 days of Receipt). The
Buyer will have the right to reject Tobacco Leaf and call attention to other
deficiencies in deliveries by informing the Supplier in writing within the
21-day inspection period, which notice must include information about the
nature and extent of the reasons why the Tobacco Leaf should be characterized
as Non-Conforming Leaf and include the results of any control or quality
tests performed by the Buyer that indicate the Tobacco Leaf is Non-Conforming
Leaf. If the Buyer fails to timely notify the Supplier of the Buyers
rejection of the Tobacco Leaf, the Buyer will be deemed to have accepted the
Tobacco Leaf as conforming. The Buyer may only reject and refuse acceptance of

 Tobacco Leaf that is Non-Conforming Leaf. Within 21 days after receiving
such a notice, the Supplier may contest the rejection and provide
documentation and other evidence relating to the quality of the applicable
Tobacco Leaf. The Supplier may also inspect the Tobacco Leaf and collect a
representative sample thereof for testing and analysis. Thereafter, the
Parties will confer in good faith to resolve the controversy. If any Tobacco
Leaf is finally deemed to be Non-Conforming Tobacco Leaf, at the election of
the Supplier, it will be destroyed or otherwise returned to the Supplier
pursuant to the Suppliers instructions, at no cost to the Buyer. The Buyer
will not be responsible for any payment for Non-Conforming Tobacco Leaf (and
in the event that the Buyer has paid for the Non-Conforming Tobacco Leaf, the
Buyer will be entitled, at the Buyers election, to a credit for or refund of
that payment).

 immediately terminated by the Party having such belief. Each Party further
agrees that any past violations of these Laws are its sole responsibility, and
that it will indemnify the other for any penalty or fine associated with its
past violation that is ascribed to the other as a result of its past actions.

its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, including any failure to supply Tobacco Leaf in accordance with the

(a) During the Term and for a period of three years thereafter, each Party
receiving Confidential Information (a " _Receiving Party_ ") will maintain in
confidence all Confidential Information disclosed to it by any other Party (a
" _Disclosing Party_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to 
_Section 7.2_ , each of the Partys respective obligations of confidentiality
with respect to another Partys Trade Secrets, including the Specifications,
will be perpetual. No Party will use, disclose or grant the use of
such Confidential Information except as expressly authorized by this
Agreement. To the extent that disclosure is authorized by this Agreement, the
Receiving Party must inform its employees,

 representatives and contracting parties to whom disclosure is to be made of
this _ARTICLE 7_ , and instruct such Persons to hold in confidence and not
make use of such information for any purpose other than those purposes
permitted by this Agreement. Each Receiving Party will use at least the same
standard of care (but not less than a reasonable standard of care) as it uses
to protect its own proprietary and Trade Secret information to ensure that
such employees, representatives and contracting parties do not disclose or
make any unauthorized use of such Confidential Information. Each Receiving
Party will promptly notify the other upon discovery of any unauthorized use
or disclosure of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will be
responsible to the Disclosing Party for any loss of Confidential Information
of the Disclosing Party or breach of the provisions of this _Section 7.1_ by
any employee, representative or contracting party of the Receiving Party.

7.2 _Exceptions_. The obligations of confidentiality contained in  _Section
7.1_ will not apply to the extent that it can be established by the Receiving
Party by competent evidence that such Confidential Information: (a) was
generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain at
the time of its receipt from the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes generally
available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain after its
disclosure and other than through any act or omission of the Receiving Party
in breach of this Agreement; or (c) was received by the Receiving Party,
other than under an obligation of confidentiality, by a third Person lawfully
in possession of the information.

 

7.3 _Authorized Disclosure_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party (nor
third Persons, as applicable) will be precluded from disclosing Confidential
Information to the extent it is required to do so in response to a valid order
by a Governmental Authority, or to the extent it reasonably believes, on the
basis of advice from outside counsel, that it is required to disclose such
Confidential Information by Law, or to the extent necessary to establish its
rights under this Agreement; _provided_ that, in the event a Party believes it
is so required to disclose another Partys Confidential Information, it
will promptly provide notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party
may seek an appropriate order or other action as it deems appropriate to
prevent or limit such disclosure, and the Party required to make the
disclosure will use its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of
the other Partys Confidential Information, including by cooperating with the
other Party to obtain an appropriate order or other reliable assurance of
confidential treatment. In any event, the Party required to make the
disclosure may disclose only that portion of another Partys Confidential
Information that is legally required to be disclosed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Party (or an Affiliate of such Party) is required
to include a copy of this Agreement as an exhibit to any current or periodic
report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, such Party (or
its Affiliate) may make such filing without the prior written consent of any
other Party as long as it seeks (or causes its Affiliate to seek)
confidential treatment of any portions of this Agreement that, in the opinion
of such filing Party, contain confidential or competitively sensitive
information, regardless of whether such treatment is obtained.

termination or at such later date as may be specified in that notice; (ii) the
other Party ceases to pay its debts as they mature in the ordinary course of

days of receipt of notice of breach from the terminating Party, or if such
breach is not reasonably capable of cure within such 30-day period, such
breaching Party fails to cure the breach within 60 days of receipt of notice
of breach from the terminating Party; _except_ that the foregoing right to
cure (a) will not apply to any breach by any Party involving violation of any
applicable Law, Governmental Approval or any breach that is not capable of
being cured, and (b) is conditioned upon the breaching Party promptly
commencing and thereafter diligently pursuing the cure to the reasonable
satisfaction of the non-breaching Party.

8.4 _Termination for Interference or Frustration of Purpose_. If both (a) the

Buyers intended use of the Tobacco Leaf being supplied for it under

Leaf as required under this Agreement, or (iii) any other material obligation
of a Party as contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) the Parties are unable

reorganizing the Parties arrangements under this Agreement so as to eliminate
the effect of such interference or to minimize, or minimize the effect of,
such interference to the point where it is no longer material within a period
of 60 days of a Party notifying the other Party of such interference, then the
affected Party may terminate this Agreement, effective upon the earlier of (A)

inhibition or frustration of purpose.

(a) Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, this Agreement will terminate and become void and of no further
force and effect, and there will be no further liability or obligation on the
part of any Party hereto. Each Partys right of termination under _Sections
8.2_ , _8.3_ and _8.4_ , is in addition to any other rights it may have under
this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will
not constitute an election of remedies and will not relieve any Party of

agrees to: (A) return all of the Buyers Confidential Information; (B) stop

all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added,
excise and other such taxes and fees (including any penalties) imposed in
connection with the purchase of Tobacco Leaf from the Supplier (if any) will

so. No Party will have the right to direct or control the employees of any
other Party. No Party will be liable for the debts, obligations or other

contractors, including any costs for salaries, benefits or taxes. 

9.4 _Force Majeure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no Party will be liable for any loss, injury, delay, damage or
other casualty suffered by any other Party due to any inability to perform any
obligation hereunder, and no Party will be deemed to have defaulted under or
breached this Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any

courts). Each of the Parties further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document hand delivered or sent by U.S. registered mail to

conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment in any jurisdiction or
in any other manner provided in law or in equity.

EXHIBIT C

 

 _SUPPLIES TO RESTRICTED COUNTRIES_

 

 _U. S. International Trade Laws_

 

 _ _List of Prohibited Countries__

U.S. export control laws and regulations impose a general embargo on trade
with, exports to, transshipments through, and financial transactions involving
the following Prohibited Countries: Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan, and Myanmar
(Burma) (collectively, "Prohibited Countries"). The Buyer acknowledges that
this list of Prohibited Countries changes on an irregular basis, and the Buyer
agrees that it is responsible for regular monitoring of changes in this list
of Prohibited Countries. Other, more limited U.S. trade embargoes also exist
and the Buyer agrees that it is responsible for complying with all aspects of
these embargoes as described more fully on the internet site at:
_http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/_. 

__Denied Parties__

U.S. export controls also prohibit exports to and financial transactions with
individuals, companies and organizations identified on a list of Denied
Parties specifically identified as "Specially Designated Nationals" (SDN),
published by OFAC at (http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/sdn/
index.html). Moreover, the Department of Commerce also publishes "Denied
Parties," "Entities" and "Unverified Parties" lists of companies and
individuals who are prohibited from involvement in U.S. export or re-export
transactions _(http://www.bxa.doc.gov/_ ). Each of the lists identified above
is updated on an irregular, but sometimes frequent, basis, and the Buyer
agrees that it is responsible for regular monitoring of changes in these
lists and compliance with requirements not to export to or conduct financial
transactions with any entity identified on these lists without an export
license obtained from the U.S. government.

 

 _ _Anti-boycott Laws__

The U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service enforce
Anti-boycott Laws and regulations that prohibit cooperation with foreign
embargoes that are not endorsed by the U.S. government. The U.S. Anti-boycott
Laws are aimed particularly at preventing cooperation with the Arab League
boycott of Israel. These laws prohibit agreements to cooperate with such
boycotts and actions to support such boycotts. These laws also require
reporting to the U.S. government of operations in countries enforcing such
embargoes and reporting of certain requests to cooperate with such embargoes.
The Buyer agrees that it will strictly comply with the requirements of Anti-
boycott Laws and regulations.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants in
this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _SERVICES_

 

Section 1.01. _Provision of Services_.

 

(a) Sellers hereby agree to provide, or to cause one or more of their
Affiliates or other third parties to provide, to Buyer and certain of
its Affiliates, solely for use in connection with the Business, the Services
described on _Schedule I_ , in each case upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 

(b) Buyer hereby agrees to provide, or to cause one or more of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) or other third parties to provide, to
Sellers and certain of their Affiliates, the Services described on _Schedule
II_ , in each case upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each of
the services described on _Schedules I_ and _II_ is referred to as a "
_Service_ " and, collectively, the " _Services_."

(c) The Party or its Affiliate(s) providing Services (each, a " _Provider_ ")
will provide to the Party or its Affiliate(s) receiving Services (each, a "
_Recipient_ ") each of the Services for the term set forth on the Schedules;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Provider shall not be obligated to perform
any such Service to be provided by it if and to the extent that such Service:
(i) is out of the ordinary course of what has historically been (A) provided
to the Recipient or one of its Affiliates or (B) performed by the Recipient
or one of its Affiliates, in each case in accordance with past practices,
including, in a volume substantially greater than that which has been
historically provided to or performed by the Recipient or one of its
Affiliates, (ii) would require the Provider to hire any additional personnel
or make any capital expenditures, (iii) is for any operations of the Recipient
other than in respect of the Business, in the case of Services to be
provided by Sellers or their Affiliates, or in respect of the operations
retained by Sellers and their Affiliates, in the case of Services to be
provided by Buyer or its Affiliates, or (iv) violate any applicable Law to
which the Provider is subject. If the Provider determines that it is unable
to provide any Service in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as a
result of the circumstances set forth in subclauses (i) through (iv) above,
the Parties will cooperate in good faith to determine the best alternative
approach.

(d) Notwithstanding the contents of the Schedules, each Party agrees to
respond in good faith to any reasonable request for additional services
necessary for the operation of the requesting Partys business, but not
currently contemplated in the relevant Schedule, at a price to be agreed upon
after good faith negotiations between the Parties. Any such additional
services so provided by a Party or its Affiliates will constitute Services
under this Agreement and be subject in all respects to the provisions of this
Agreement as if fully set forth on the relevant Schedule as of the date of
this Agreement.

(e) During the term of this Agreement, the Parties will cooperate in good
faith in all matters relating to the provision and receipt of Services,
including as contemplated by _Section 1.06_. Such cooperation will include
(i) subject to _Section 3.01_ , exchanging

 information reasonably requested by the other Party, (ii) subject to
_ARTICLE II_ , performing true-ups and adjustments, and (iii) subject to
_Section 4.03(b)_ and to the extent consistent with the applicable Services,
making decisions and providing consent and acceptance as promptly as
practicable when such decisions, consent or acceptance are required by the
terms hereof, and, as reasonably requested by the other Party and at such
other Partys sole cost and expense, using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all third-party consents, licenses, sublicenses or approvals (" _Third-
Party Consents_ ") necessary or desirable in order to permit each Party to
perform its obligations under this Agreement in a timely and efficient manner.
The Provider will not (A) be liable for any impairment of any Service arising
from a failure by the Recipient to timely provide accurate and complete
information that is required or reasonably requested by the Provider in
connection with such Service or (B) have any responsibility for verifying the
correctness of any information provided by or on behalf of the Recipient
in connection with any Service. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the
Recipient fails to provide required information, the Provider will be released
from its obligation to perform any Service for which such information is
required until such time as the required information is provided. The
Provider shall be entitled to make changes from time to time in the
procedures, processes, resources and policies it utilizes to perform any
Services; provided that (i) the Provider gives the Recipient written notice
30 calendar days prior to any material change; (ii) such change will not
materially degrade the performance (including as to timing and frequency of
the applicable Service) or materially diminish the usefulness to
the Recipient of the applicable Service; and (iii) such change will not
result in an increase in the Service Fee charged to the Recipient for the
applicable Service.

 

Section 1.02. _Quality and Scope of Services; Disclaimer of Warranties_. Each
Party shall provide the Services hereunder in accordance with applicable Law
and, except as otherwise specifically provided in the Schedules, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Services hereunder with the
same standard of care as historically provided. Subject to  _Section 1.03_,
each Party agrees to assign sufficient resources and qualified personnel
reasonably required to provide the Services in accordance with the standards
set forth in the preceding sentence. Except as expressly set forth in this
_Section 1.02_ or in the Schedules, no Party makes any representations or
warranties of any kind, implied or expressed, with respect to the Services to
be provided by such Party, including, without limitation, any warranties
of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, which are
specifically disclaimed.

Section 1.03. _Third-Party Providers_. Each Party will have the right to hire
third-party subcontractors to provide all or part of any Service to be
provided by such Party hereunder. Any Party that subcontracts Services shall
in all cases retain responsibility for the provision to the Party of all such
Services whether subcontracted to a third party or performed by an Affiliate.

Section 1.04. _Services Not Included_. It is not the intent of any Provider
to render, nor of any Recipient to receive from any Provider, (a) professional
advice or opinions with regard to tax, legal, treasury, finance, employment,
any other business and financial matters or the handling or addressing of
environmental matters; or (b) technical advice with regard to

 information technology or any other matters. No Recipient shall rely on or
construe any Service rendered by or on behalf of any Provider as such
professional advice, opinions or technical advice, and each Recipient shall
seek all third-party professional advice, opinions or technical advice that it
may desire or need.

Section 1.05.  _Access to Facilities_.

(a) The Recipient shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, allow the
Provider and its Representatives reasonable access to its facilities as is
necessary for such Provider to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) Except as otherwise permitted by the Recipient in writing, each Provider
shall permit only its authorized Representatives, contractors, invitees or
licensees to access the Recipients facilities.

 

Section 1.06. _Cooperation_. It is understood that it will require the
significant efforts of both Parties to implement this Agreement and to ensure
performance by the Parties at the agreed-upon levels and in accordance with
all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge the
transitional nature of the Services. Accordingly, as promptly as practicable
following the execution of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use reasonable
best efforts to transition each Service to its own internal organization or to
a third-party service provider. The Parties will cooperate, acting in
good faith and using reasonable best efforts, to effect a smooth and orderly
transition of the Services provided under this Agreement from the Providers to
the Recipients (including the assignment or transfer of the rights and
obligations under any third-party contracts relating to the Services);
_provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 1.06_ shall not require any
Provider (whether directly or through an Affiliate or subcontractor) to incur
any out-of-pocket costs or expenses in connection with the transition of such
Services to the Recipient.

Section 1.07. _Data Protection_. While carrying out its duties under this
Agreement, a Provider shall only process personal data received from a
Recipient (a) in such a manner as is necessary to carry out those duties, (b)
in accordance with the instructions of such Recipient, (c) in accordance with
applicable laws relating to the protection of information commonly known as
"sensitive personal information," "personally identifiable information" or
similar terms, and (d) using appropriate technical and organizational
measures to prevent the unauthorized or unlawful processing of such personal
data and/or the accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, such personal
data.

 

ARTICLE II

_PAYMENTS_

 

Section 2.01. _Payments_.

 

(a) In consideration of the provision of the Services, the Recipient will pay
to the Provider for each such Service an amount equal to (i) the amount set
forth on the relevant

 



E-4 CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED BY REYNOLDS AMERICAN INC.  CONFIDENTIAL
PORTIONS OF THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY *****, HAVE BEEN REDACTED AND HAVE BEEN
SEPARATELY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE
24B-2 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.

 



 

 Schedule, as the same may be amended from time to time, on a Service by
Service basis (the " _Service Fee_ ") and (ii) any additional reasonable out-
of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the Provider in connection with the
provision of such Service for the benefit of the Recipient, in each case, with
respect to the applicable price and payment period set forth on the applicable
Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Service Fee payable in connection
with any Service that is terminated may be pro-rated if such Service is
terminated prior to the end of such Services term in accordance with _Section
5.02_. To the extent a Service is billed on an hourly basis, unless otherwise
agreed by the Parties, the Service Fee for such Services will be [●]/hour.

(b) If at any time the Party providing Services reasonably believes that the
Service Fees contemplated by a specific Schedule are materially insufficient
to compensate it for the cost of providing the related Services hereunder
(taking into account, where applicable, the Parties expectation that the
Provider is to receive a 10% markup on the costs of providing certain
Services), or the Party receiving Services reasonably believes that the
Service Fees contemplated by a specific Schedule materially overcompensate
the Provider for such Services (such that such Provider is receiving
materially in excess of the agreed markup, if any, on the costs of providing
such Service), such Party shall provide documentation of such material
insufficiency or material overcompensation to the other Party as soon as
possible, and the Parties will commence good faith negotiations regarding the
appropriate course of action with respect to pricing of such Services for
future periods; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither Party shall be
permitted to propose renegotiation of the Service Fees more than once during
any calendar year with respect to any class of Services (e.g., finance, HR,
consumer marketing, etc.).

 

Section 2.02. _Manner and Timing of Payments_. All payments will be made by
the Recipient, without set-off, within 20 Business Days after receipt of a
reasonably detailed invoice. Invoices for Services will be sent by the
Provider or its designee to the Recipient on a monthly basis and shall be
reasonably detailed and identify the Services that are the subject of the
invoice. Amounts not paid within such 20 Business Day period will bear
interest thereon at the rate of 10.0% per annum from the date such payment was
due until the date of payment. All payments made by the Recipient under this
Agreement will be by wire transfer to the Providers account identified in
_Exhibit A_ or to such other account specified in writing by the Provider to
the Recipient.

 

Section 2.03. _Disputes_. If the Recipient disputes in good faith any portion
of the amount due on any invoice, then the Recipient will notify the Provider
in writing of the nature and basis of the dispute within 10 Business Days
after the Recipients receipt of such invoice. If no notification is provided
to the Provider in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then
the invoiced amount will be deemed to be accurate and correct and will not be
subject to dispute or contest by the Recipient. In the event the Recipient
provides notice of a dispute, the Parties will use their reasonable best
efforts to resolve the dispute prior to the date such payment is due. During
the pendency of any such dispute each Party will continue performing its
obligations under this Agreement.

Section 2.04. _Taxes_. Each amount payable under this Agreement, including
pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_, _Section 2.02_ and the Schedules, is
expressed exclusive of any sales tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax
or similar tax (" _Taxes_ ") that may be imposed by a taxing authority.
The Recipient will reimburse the Provider for all Taxes (excluding any Tax
based on the net income of the Provider) paid by the Provider attributable to
the supply of Services, which will be separately stated on the relevant
invoice.

 

ARTICLE III

 

 _CONFIDENTIALITY_

 

Section 3.01. _Confidentiality_. With respect to all materials, documents,
programs, data and information (the " _Confidential Information_ ") furnished
by one Party (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") to the other Party (the " _Receiving
Party_ ") or, in each case, by or to an Affiliate thereof, in connection with
this Agreement, the Receiving Party (a) will keep the Confidential
Information confidential using the same safeguards and standard of care that
it uses to preserve the confidentiality of its own confidential information
and will not, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party,
disclose any Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever and (b) will
not use any Confidential Information other than in connection with the
Services or in fulfilling any other obligations under this Agreement; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Receiving Party may reveal the Confidential
Information to its Representatives (i) who need to know the Confidential
Information for the purposes of providing or receiving the Services, as
applicable, or for fulfilling any other obligations of the Receiving Party
hereunder, (ii) who are informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential
nature of the Confidential Information, and (iii) who agree to act in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 3.01_. The Receiving Party will
cause its Representatives to observe the terms of this _Section 3.01_, and
the Receiving Party will be responsible for any breach of this _Section 3.01_
by any of its Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, any materials,
documents, programs, data or information provided by one Party to the other
Party pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement shall be subject to the
confidentiality provisions of the Purchase Agreement and shall not be subject
to the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement.

Section 3.02. _Use and Disclosure Limitations_. The obligation of
confidentiality under this _ARTICLE III_ will not apply to the extent that it
can be established by the Receiving Party by competent proof that such
Confidential Information:

 

(a) was already known to or in the possession of the Receiving Party, other
than under an obligation of confidentiality, at the time of receipt from the
Disclosing Party;

(b) was generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public
domain at the time of its receipt from the Disclosing Party;

(c) became generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public
domain after its disclosure other than through any act or omission of the
Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement;

 



E-6 CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED BY REYNOLDS AMERICAN INC.  CONFIDENTIAL
PORTIONS OF THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY *****, HAVE BEEN REDACTED AND HAVE BEEN
SEPARATELY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE
24B-2 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.

 



 

(d) was received by the Receiving Party, other than under an obligation of
confidentiality, from a third Person lawfully in possession of the
Confidential Information that was itself free from any restrictions on use or
obligations of confidentiality with respect to such Confidential Information;
or

 

(e) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference or
access to any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. 

Section 3.03. _Required Disclosure_. In the event disclosure of Confidential
Information is permitted by applicable Law and is compelled by judicial or
administrative process or required by operation of Law, the Receiving Party
will promptly notify the Disclosing Party and otherwise cooperate, at the
Disclosing Partys expense, with the Disclosing Party so that the Disclosing
Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in the
Disclosing Partys sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this
_ARTICLE III_. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy
is obtained, or that the Disclosing Party does not waive compliance with the
terms of this _ARTICLE III_ , the Receiving Party will furnish only that
portion of the Confidential Information that it is advised by counsel is
legally required and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential
Information.

 

Section 3.04. _Relief_. The Receiving Party agrees that unauthorized
disclosure or use of the Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm

with respect to liability of a Party to the other Party due to a breach of
_ARTICLE III_ , will a Partys liability to the other Party exceed the

will defend, indemnify and hold the other Party and its respective Affiliates,

Any claim for indemnification hereunder will be subject to the indemnification
procedures set forth in Article IX of the Purchase Agreement.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Party will

any other Party due to any inability to perform any obligation hereunder, and
no Party will be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement for
failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term or provision of
this Agreement (other than payment of monies due), when such failure or delay
is caused by or results from causes beyond the control of the affected Party,
including acts of God, fire, flood, storm, earthquake, explosion, epidemic,
delays in transportation, shortages of trucks or vessels, shortages of fuel,
shortages of raw materials, environmental catastrophe, embargo, war, acts of
war (whether war be declared or not), acts of terrorism, insurrection, riot,

necessary for provision of any Service, then, (i) the Provider will promptly
notify the Recipient of the failure to obtain such Third-Party Consent, (ii)
neither the Provider nor any of its Affiliates will have any obligation
hereunder with respect to any Service for which such Third-Party Consent is
required or any liability whatsoever to the Recipient for the failure to
provide any such Service and (iii) the Recipient will have no obligation to
pay the Service Fee for any Service that the Provider is consequently unable
to, and does not, provide.

which such Services are to be permanently discontinued (the " _Termination
Date_ "). If any Services are permanently discontinued by the Recipient in
accordance with the foregoing sentence, this Agreement will terminate as to
such Services as of the Termination Date thereof and if all Services have
been so discontinued, this Agreement will terminate as of the Termination Date
of the last category of Services, in each case without further action and in
each case subject to any outstanding payment obligations of the Parties.

written agreement of the Parties. In the event:

(a) that a Party fails to pay for any or all Services in accordance with the

good faith in accordance with Section _2.03_ ), then any non-defaulting Party
will have the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate the applicable
Service(s) and/or this Agreement and its participation with the defaulting
Party under this Agreement if the defaulting Party has failed to pay all
amounts owed under this Agreement (other than amounts disputed in good faith
in accordance with _Section 2.03_ ) within five Business Days after receiving
written notice of such default; or

(b) of any default by either Party, in any material respect, in the due
performance or observance by it of any of the other terms, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, then any non-defaulting Party will
have the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate the applicable
Service(s) and/or this Agreement and its participation with the defaulting
Party under this Agreement if the defaulting Party has failed to cure the
default within 20 Business Days after receiving written notice of such

Section 5.03. _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, (a) _ARTICLE II_ ,  _ARTICLE III_ , _ARTICLE IV_ , this
_Section 5.03_ and _ARTICLE VI_ will survive the expiration or termination of
this Agreement and (b) the expiration or termination of this Agreement will
not act as a waiver of any breach of this Agreement or as a release of either
Party from any liability or obligation incurred under this Agreement through
the effective date of the expiration or termination.

reasonable access to audit such Providers records relating to the performance
of such Provider under the terms of this Agreement and to the computation of,
and resolution of disputes relating to, amounts charged to such Recipient for
the Services it received pursuant to this Agreement. Such audits shall occur
during normal business hours, not more frequently than twice during the term
of this Agreement, and must be conducted within 60 days after the expiration
or termination of this Agreement. If such an audit reveals a credit due to
the Recipient, then (a) if the credit due is revealed during the term of this
Agreement, the Provider will provide a credit for the applicable amount on a
subsequent monthly invoice provided to the Recipient and within 30 days after
receipt of the applicable audit report and (b) if the credit due is revealed
after the termination of this Agreement, the Provider will issue a check to
the Recipient for the applicable amount within 30 days after receipt of the

the Recipient an employer, directly or indirectly, of the Providers
employees. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as creating
a partnership, joint venture, agency, trust or other association of any kind,
each Party being individually responsible only for its obligations set forth
in this Agreement.

Reynolds American announces sale of

 

Natural American Spirit international businesses to JT Group

 

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  Sept. 29, 2015 Reynolds American Inc. (NYSE: RAI)
announced today that the international rights to the Natural American Spirit
brand name and associated trademarks, along with the international companies
that distribute and market the brand outside the U.S., will be sold to the
Japan Tobacco Group of companies (JT Group) in an all-cash transaction with
a value of approximately $5.0 billion.

The purchase does not include the rights to the Natural American Spirit brand
name and associated trademarks in the U.S. market, U.S. duty-free locations,
U.S. territories or in U.S. military outlets, all of which will be retained by
Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc. Santa Fe is a wholly owned subsidiary
of RAI.

 

The international companies being sold employ about 280 people, primarily in
Europe and Japan. Those companies distribute and market Natural American
Spirit additive-free and organic styles of cigarettes and roll-your-own
tobacco primarily in European and Asian markets. The brands largest markets
are Japan, Germany and Switzerland. Natural American Spirit sells at a premium
price in each of the markets in which it competes, just as it does in the
U.S. market.

"Natural American Spirit has achieved excellent international growth over the
past several years," said Susan M. Cameron, RAIs president and CEO. "When
backed by the strength of the JT Groups international distribution, sales
force and manufacturing capabilities, we believe that growth trajectory will
not only continue, but accelerate," she said.

Selling the international trademark rights to a company with an established
global infrastructure was more advantageous to RAI than investing in an
international infrastructure capable of supporting Natural American Spirits
growth potential, Cameron said. "We believe this sale once again demonstrates
our commitment to creating value for our shareholders, and we believe the
addition of Natural American Spirit to the JT Groups brand portfolio will
benefit their investors as well," she said.

 

Cameron noted that once the transaction is complete, the international rights
to all of RAIs operating companies cigarette trademarks will be owned by
international tobacco companies, allowing the RAI companies to focus on brand
growth in the U.S. market.

The transactions must be approved by regulatory authorities in a number of
countries. The companies are working to attain regulatory approvals by early
2016, and the transaction will close thereafter.

All current international employees will become employees of the JT Group of
companies following the closing of the transaction.

Day acted as legal advisor to RAI on this transaction.

_FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE_

 

Tokyo, September 29, 2015

JT Acquires Natural American Spirit Business outside the United States

Japan Tobacco Inc. (JT) (TSE: 2914) announced today that the JT Group
has entered into an agreement with the Reynolds American Inc. group of
companies ("RAI") to acquire the Natural American Spirit business outside the
United States which includes the trademarks and all outstanding shares of
RAIs subsidiaries outside the U.S. which sell the brand. The transaction is
expected to be completed by early 2016.

1\. Purpose for the Acquisition

 

Since its launch in the U.S. in 1982 by Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company,
Inc., the Natural American Spirit brand has provided a unique product offering
and established a special brand positioning as the only truly global
"additive free", premium cigarette with a marketing theme that is
environmentally conscious and socially progressive. The brand has enjoyed
strong growth momentum in the U.S., Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Italy,
Spain, the U.K. and others.

"Natural American Spirit, which has a strong and international presence in
a premium priced category, will allow the JT Group to further extend its
brand portfolio. This strong and unique brand equity combined with an
energetic and experienced team of people will further strengthen our Groups
business foundation," said Mitsuomi Koizumi, President and Chief Executive
Officer of the JT Group.

Notably in Japan, which now accounts for the majority of the sales
volume worldwide excluding the U.S., the brand has experienced significant
growth. This investment will underpin the Groups sustainable long-term profit
growth in this highly competitive market.

 

The existing operations of the acquired companies will be expected to remain
unchanged in order to fully benefit from their extensive knowledge
and experience.
