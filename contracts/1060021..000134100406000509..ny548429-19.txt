follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                      PLAN OF MERGER; PURCHASE AND SALE OF
                      MLIM TRANSFERRED INTERESTS; CLOSING

         Section 1.1.  Plan of Merger.

         (a) The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined below), and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), BlackRock
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into BlackRock (the "Merger"), the separate
existence of BlackRock Merger Sub as a corporation shall cease and BlackRock
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Entity") and a
Subsidiary of New BlackRock.

         (b) Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of Article VI,
on the Closing Date the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

         (c) Merger Consideration. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action by any party:

             (i) each share of BlackRock Class A Common Stock issued and
     outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
     for the right to receive one share of New BlackRock Common Stock;

             (ii) each share of BlackRock Class B Common Stock issued and
     outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
     for the right to receive one share of New BlackRock Common Stock; and

             (iii) each share of BlackRock Merger Sub Common Stock issued and
     outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be converted and exchanged for
     one share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
     Entity.

         (d) Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time,
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of BlackRock Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended in
accordance with their respective terms and applicable law.

         (e) Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, the
directors and officers of BlackRock Merger Sub shall be the directors and
officers of the Surviving Entity, and such directors and officers shall serve
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Entity.

         Section 1.2 Contribution of MLIM Transferred Interests.

         (a) Immediately after the Effective Time, MLIM Parent shall cause the
MLIM Transferors to transfer, assign and deliver to New BlackRock all of the
right, title and interest in and to the MLIM Transferred Interests, free and
clear of any Liens, and with all rights attached thereto (the "MLIM
Contribution").

         (b) At the Closing, in consideration for the MLIM Contribution
pursuant to Section 1.2(a), New BlackRock shall issue to the MLIM Transferors,
in such proportions as shall be determined pursuant to Section 8.10, free and
clear of any Liens, the MLIM Consideration. "MLIM Consideration" means
65,000,000 New BlackRock Shares. The MLIM Consideration shall consist of (i)
solely New BlackRock Common Stock unless the MLIM Consideration shall exceed
the Common Stock Cap and (ii) if the MLIM Consideration shall exceed the Common
Stock Cap, shares of New BlackRock Common Stock equal to the Common Stock Cap
plus shares of New BlackRock Preferred Stock, designated as Series A
Participating Preferred Stock and having the terms set forth in Annex B
(the "New BlackRock Series A Preferred Stock"), equal to the total number of
New BlackRock Shares included in the MLIM Consideration less the Common Stock
Cap. "Common Stock Cap" means 45 percent of the quotient determined by dividing
the number of BlackRock Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time by 0.55.

         (c) The MLIM Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately
the effect of any forward or reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities exercisable or exchangeable for or
convertible into the applicable BlackRock Shares), stock issuance or sale,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the applicable BlackRock Shares the
record date for which occurs prior to the Effective Time.

         (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.2, if
the number of New BlackRock Shares included in the MLIM Consideration, as
specified in Section 1.2(b), and as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.2(c),
exceeds the Share Cap, the MLIM Consideration shall consist of a number of New
BlackRock Shares equal to the Share Cap (subject to clause (i) and clause (ii)
of Section 1.2(b)) and cash in an amount equal to the product of such excess
and the BlackRock Market Price as of the Closing Date. "Share Cap" means 49.8
percent of the quotient determined by dividing the number of BlackRock Shares
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (on a Fully Diluted basis) by
0.502.

         Section 1.3 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Transactions (the "Closing") shall occur at 10:00
a.m. at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Four Times
Square, New York, New York 10036, or at such other location as may be mutually
agreed by BlackRock and MLIM Parent, on the first practicable MLIM Parent
month-end date to occur after all of the conditions in Article VI have been
satisfied or waived (other than conditions that relate to actions to be taken,
or documents to be delivered, at the Closing) or on such other date as may be
mutually agreed by MLIM Parent and BlackRock (such date, the "Closing Date").

         Section 1.4 Deliveries at Closing. At the Closing:

         (a) MLIM Parent shall cause the MLIM Transferors to deliver to New
BlackRock the MLIM Transferred Interests, along with such instruments of
transfer and assignment and other documentation as may be reasonably required
to evidence that such MLIM Transferred Interests have been duly assigned and
transferred to New BlackRock;

         (b) New BlackRock shall deliver to the MLIM Transferors designated by
MLIM Parent the MLIM Consideration, including a certificate or certificates
evidencing New BlackRock Common Stock included in the MLIM Consideration;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, subject to Section 8.10, New BlackRock may transfer all or a portion
of the MLIM Consideration first to a direct Subsidiary treated as a disregarded
entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then cause such Subsidiary to
deliver such consideration to the MLIM Transferors that transferred the UK
Entities; and

         (c) each party hereto shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered,
to each other party, as applicable, each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a
party, duly executed, and all other previously undelivered documents required
to be delivered by such party to another party pursuant to this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements.

                                  ARTICLE II

                            [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

                                  ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                                 OF MLIM PARENT

         Except as set forth in writing in a Schedule attached to the
Disclosure Letter delivered by MLIM Parent to BlackRock on the date hereof (the
"MLIM Parent Disclosure Letter") referencing the appropriate section of this
Article III (references in this Article III to any "Schedule" being deemed to
refer to Schedules to such Disclosure Letter) or otherwise readily apparently
pertaining to any section of this Article III, MLIM Parent represents and
warrants to BlackRock as follows, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
Date:

         Section 3.1 Organization. Each of MLIM Parent and each MLIM Business
Entity is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and (where
applicable) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. Each of MLIM Parent and each MLIM Business Entity has the
requisite power and authority to carry on its business and to own, lease and
operate all of its properties and assets, as currently conducted, owned, leased
or operated. Each of MLIM Parent and each MLIM Business Entity is duly
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the character or location of the properties and assets owned,
leased or operated by it makes such qualification necessary other than any
failure to be so qualified that, individually and in the aggregate, has not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have or result in, a MLIM Material
Adverse Effect. Each Organizational Document of each MLIM Business Entity is in
full force and effect and there has been no material violation thereof.

         Section 3.2 MLIM Capital Structure.

         (a) After giving effect to the MLIM Restructuring, all of the issued
and outstanding MLIM Transferred Interests will have been duly authorized and

         Section 3.8 Financial Statements.

         (a) Schedule 3.8(a) contains complete and correct copies of the

month period ending December 31, 2005, (ii) an unaudited combined balance sheet
for the MLIM Business as of December 31, 2005, and (iii) an unaudited combined
balance sheet for the MLIM Business as of December 31, 2005 giving pro forma
effect to the MLIM Restructuring (the "MLIM Balance Sheet"). The MLIM Financial
Statements have been derived from the accounting books and records of the MLIM
Business Entities and the MLIM Financial Statements (other than the MLIM
Balance Sheet) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied,
subject only to normal recurring year-end adjustments and the absence of notes
and except as expressly provided in such MLIM Financial Statements. Each
balance sheet included in the MLIM Financial Statements presents fairly in all
material respects the financial position of the MLIM Business as of the date
thereof, and the income statement included in the MLIM Financial Statements
presents fairly in all material respects the results of operations of the MLIM
Business for the period indicated therein. The MLIM Balance Sheet was prepared
in accordance with the MLIM Financial Statement Principles.

         (b) The books and records of the MLIM Business have been maintained in
accordance with good business practices. The MLIM Balance Sheet does not
reflect any material asset that is not intended to constitute a part of the
MLIM Business after giving effect to the Transactions (excluding routine
dispositions of assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice), and the income statement for the 12 month period ending December 31,
2005 included in the MLIM Financial Statements does not reflect the results of
any material operations of any Person that are not intended to constitute a
part of the MLIM Business after giving effect to the Transactions. Such income
statement reflects all material costs that historically have been incurred in
connection with the operation of the Business.

         (c) The MLIM Companies maintain in all material respects internal
controls over financial reporting ("Internal Controls") to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP,
including policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the MLIM Companies, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of the MLIM Companies are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the MLIM Companies and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the MLIM
Companies that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

         Section 3.9 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither any MLIM
Business Entity nor the MLIM Business is subject to any claims, liabilities or
obligations (whether known, unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise), and there are no existing conditions, situations or facts that
would or would reasonably be expected to result in any such claim, obligation
or liability, except (a) as and to the extent disclosed and reserved against on
the MLIM Balance Sheet and (b) claims, obligations and liabilities that are
contractual in nature and that (i) are incurred after the date of the MLIM
Balance Sheet, (ii) are consistent in nature, type and amount with any such
claims, obligations and liabilities regularly incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice of each MLIM Business Entity and the
MLIM Business, (iii) individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have or result in a MLIM Material Adverse Effect

this Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement, (x) each of the MLIM Companies has in
all material respects conducted the MLIM Business in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices of the MLIM Business, (y) there has not
occurred or come to exist any MLIM Material Adverse Effect and (z) the MLIM
Business Entities have not and, in connection with the MLIM Business, MLIM
Parent and its Controlled Affiliates other than the MLIM Business Entities have
not taken any action that would have been prohibited by Section 5.1(b) of this
Agreement, had such Section 5.1(b) been applicable during such period.

         Section 3.11 Assets. MLIM Parent and the MLIM Business Entities own
and have and, after giving effect to the MLIM Restructuring and the
consummation of the Transactions and the execution and delivery of the
Transition Services Agreement and the License Agreement (and assuming the

its Subsidiaries (including the MLIM Transferred Entities and their
Subsidiaries) will own and have good, valid and marketable title to or, in the
case of leased property, good and valid leasehold interests in, or otherwise
will have full or sufficient and legally enforceable rights to use without any
increase in payment therefor (except by reason of the Transition Services
Agreement), all of the properties and assets (real, personal or mixed, tangible
or intangible) used or held for use in connection with, necessary for the
conduct of, or otherwise material to the operations of, the MLIM Business,
including all such assets reflected in the MLIM Balance Sheet or acquired since
the date thereof or reflected in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (all of
the assets referred to in this sentence, the "Assets"), in each case free and
clear of any Lien other than Permitted Liens, except for any failure to have
such titles, interests or rights that, individually or in the aggregate, has

Material Adverse Effect. MLIM Parent and the MLIM Business Entities have and,
after giving effect to the MLIM Restructuring and the consummation of the

will have, maintained in all material respects all tangible Assets in good
repair, working order and operating condition, subject only to ordinary wear
and tear.

         Section 3.12 Real Property. None of the MLIM Business Entities, or, in
connection with the MLIM Business, MLIM Parent and the Controlled Affiliates of
MLIM Parent owns any real property or any interest therein. Schedule 3.12
identifies (i) all material office locations in which any MLIM Business Entity
is occupying space that is leased by MLIM Parent or an Affiliate of MLIM
Parent, (ii) all of the material Leases to which any MLIM Business Entity is a
party. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12, such leased real property
constitutes all material real property leased, subleased, licensed or otherwise
used in the operation of the MLIM Business as presently conducted. True and
correct copies of such real property Leases have been delivered or made
available to BlackRock, together with any amendments, modifications or
supplements thereto. There exists no material default or condition, or any
state of facts or event which with the passage of time or giving of notice or
both would constitute a material default, in the performance of its obligations
under any of such real property Leases by MLIM Parent or any of its Controlled
Affiliates or, to the knowledge of MLIM Parent, by any other party to any of
such Leases. Except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
and similar applicable Laws affecting creditors generally and by the
availability of equitable remedies (a) each of the real property Leases are
legal, valid and binding obligations of MLIM Parent or a MLIM Controlled
Affiliate, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of MLIM Parent, each other
party to such Leases and (b) each of the Leases is enforceable against MLIM
Parent or its Controlled Affiliate, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of
MLIM Parent, each other party to such Lease, except in each case for failures
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have or result in a MLIM Material Adverse Effect. Neither MLIM
Parent nor any of its Controlled Affiliates has received any written or oral
communication from the landlord or lessor under any of such real property
Leases claiming that it is in breach of its obligations under such Leases,
except for written or oral communications claiming breaches that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a
MLIM Material Adverse Effect.

Controlled Affiliates or, to the knowledge of MLIM Parent, any other party
thereto under any Material Contract, except in each case for any defaults that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a MLIM Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge
of MLIM Parent, there are no circumstances, occurrences, events or acts that,

Company or any other party thereto, to alter or amend any of the material terms
or conditions of any Material Contract or would permit or would result in any

ERISA), and each other plan, arrangement or policy (written or oral) relating
to stock options, stock purchases, deferred compensation, bonus, severance,
fringe benefits or other employee benefits, in each case maintained or
contributed to, or required to be maintained or contributed to, by BlackRock,
or any of BlackRock's Controlled Affiliates for the benefit of any BlackRock
Employee or Former BlackRock Employee, other than any "multiemployer plan"
(within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA) or any plans, arrangements or
policies mandated by Applicable Law is herein referred to as a "BlackRock
Benefit Plan." Each individual employment, collective bargaining, consulting,
severance and change-in-control Contract under which BlackRock or any of
BlackRock's Controlled Affiliates has any present or future liability is herein
referred to as a "BlackRock Employment Agreement." Schedule 4.13(a) contains a
true and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each material
BlackRock Benefit Plan and each material BlackRock Employment Agreement.
BlackRock has delivered or made available to MLIM Parent true, correct and
complete copies of (A) each BlackRock Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV

document) for each BlackRock Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description

         (b) Each BlackRock Benefit Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code, all other Applicable Laws and the terms of all
applicable collective bargaining agreements. There are no material
investigations by any Governmental Authority, material termination proceedings
or other material claims or Proceedings against or involving any BlackRock
Benefit Plan or asserting any rights to or claims for benefits under any
BlackRock Benefit Plan.

         (c) No BlackRock Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code. None of BlackRock or any BlackRock Controlled
Affiliate would reasonably be expected to incur any liability under Title IV of
ERISA as a result of being treated as a single employer with BlackRock or its
Affiliates for purposes of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

         (d) Each BlackRock Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received
a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service as to its
qualification under the Code and to the effect that each such trust is exempt
from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the knowledge of
BlackRock, there exist no circumstances likely to result in the loss of such
qualification or tax-exempt status.

         (e) Neither BlackRock nor any BlackRock Controlled Affiliate has,
within the preceding six years, withdrawn in a complete or partial withdrawal
from any multiemployer plan (as defined in section 3(37) of ERISA) or incurred
any liability under Section 4204 of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full.

         (f) With respect to each "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA), maintained or contributed to, or required to be
maintained or contributed to, by PNC or any of PNC's Controlled Affiliates,
other than any "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA), any plans, arrangements or policies mandated by Applicable Law or any
BlackRock Benefit Plan, there have been no events and no events are reasonably
likely to occur which would cause BlackRock or a BlackRock Controlled Affiliate
to incur any material liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code.

         (g) No amounts payable under any of the BlackRock Benefit Plans, any
BlackRock Employment Agreement or any other Contract with respect to which
BlackRock or any BlackRock Controlled Affiliate may have any liability could
fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G
of the Code as a result of the Transactions.

         (h) The consummation of the Transactions will not result in an
increase in the amount of compensation or benefits or the acceleration of the
vesting or timing of payment of any compensation or benefits payable to or in
respect of on behalf of any BlackRock Employee, or entitle any such BlackRock
Employee to any severance or similar compensation or benefits.

         (i) No BlackRock Company has any obligation to provide medical, dental
or life insurance benefits (whether or not insured) to any BlackRock Employees
or Former BlackRock Employees after retirement (other than (i) coverage
mandated by Applicable Law and (ii) benefits, the full direct cost of which is
borne by the BlackRock Employee or Former BlackRock Employee (or beneficiary
thereof)).

         Section 4.14 Intellectual Property; Information Technology. Each of
BlackRock and its Controlled Affiliates own or possesses, or can acquire on
reasonable terms, all Intellectual Property and Information Technology
necessary to carry on the business now operated by them. Neither BlackRock nor
any of its Controlled Affiliates has received any notice of infringement of or
conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any Intellectual
Property which, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable
decision, ruling or finding, would reasonably be expected to have a BlackRock
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.15 Insurance. BlackRock and each of its Controlled
Affiliates are insured by insurers of recognized financial responsibility
against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary
in the businesses in which they are engaged, or as they may be required to
maintain under Applicable Law; neither BlackRock nor any of its Controlled
Affiliates has been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied for; and
neither BlackRock nor any of its Controlled Affiliates has any reason to
believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as
and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar
insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not
have a BlackRock Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.16 Affiliate Arrangements.

         (a) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.16(a), there is no material
Contract, arrangement, liability or obligation (whether or not evidenced by a

BlackRock and its Controlled Affiliates), on the other hand (any such Contract,
liability or obligation, a "BlackRock Affiliate Arrangement").

petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents of
all third parties and Governmental Authorities set forth in Schedules 3.6 and
4.6 or that are necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions;
provided, however, that (i) no party shall be required to make any payment to
obtain any Consent from a third party (or Governmental Authority), and (ii)
neither MLIM Parent nor any of its Controlled Affiliates shall agree orally or
in writing to any material amendments to any Material Contract, to any material
concessions in any commercial arrangements or to any material loss of rights
(whether to have effect prior to or after the Closing), in each case, in
connection with obtaining any Consents from any private third-party or
Governmental Authority without obtaining the prior written consent of
BlackRock.

         (b) If any required Consent of any third party (excluding any
Governmental Authority) is not obtained prior to the Closing, the parties
hereto, each without cost, expense or liability to the other (except as
provided in Article VII hereof), shall cooperate in good faith to seek, if
possible, an alternative arrangement to achieve the economic results intended.

         (c) Subject to Applicable Law and any applicable confidentiality
restrictions, BlackRock and its counsel, on the one hand, and MLIM Parent and
its counsel, on the other hand, shall have the right to review (in advance to
the extent practicable) any information relating to BlackRock or MLIM Parent,
as the case may be, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions,
provided that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to provide any party to
this Agreement with a right to review any such information provided to any
Governmental Authority on a confidential basis in connection with the
Transactions. The parties may also, as each deems reasonably necessary,
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this
Section 5.7 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials or its legal counsel.

         (d) Promptly after the completion of its due diligence regarding the
MLIM Business in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, BlackRock
shall deliver to MLIM Parent a schedule of Governmental Approvals understood by
BlackRock to be required to be obtained by BlackRock as a result of the
regulatory status of the MLIM Transferred Entities and their Controlled
Affiliates, and the MLIM Funds except for Governmental Approvals the failure of
which to obtain, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a BlackRock Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.8 MLIM Client Consents.

         (a) Public Funds. Subject in each case to the requirements of
Applicable Law and the fiduciary duties of the MLIM Companies and the U.S. MLIM
Public Fund Boards,

             (i) MLIM Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, or use
     its reasonable best efforts to cause the MLIM Companies to, in accordance
     with Applicable Law, (A) as promptly as practicable following the date
     hereof, obtain the approval of each U.S. MLIM Public Fund Board of a new
     Investment Advisory Arrangement, to be effective at the Closing,
     containing terms, taken as a whole, that are no less favorable to the MLIM
     Companies than the terms of the existing Investment Advisory Arrangement
     between such U.S. MLIM Public Fund and the MLIM Companies, (B) as promptly
     as practicable following receipt of the approval described in clause (A)
     above, cause each U.S. MLIM Public Fund Board to call a special meeting of
     the shareholders of each Public Fund to be held as promptly as reasonably
     practicable for the purpose of obtaining the requisite approval of such
     shareholders for such new Investment Advisory Arrangement, as applicable,
     (C) as promptly as practicable following receipt of the approval described
     in clause (A) above, prepare and file, or cause each U.S. MLIM Public Fund
     to prepare and file, with the SEC and all other applicable Governmental
     Authorities all registration statements and proxy solicitation materials
     required to be distributed to the shareholders of each U.S. MLIM Public
     Fund with respect to the actions recommended for shareholder approval by
     the applicable U.S. MLIM Public Fund Board and mail, or cause to be
     mailed, such proxy solicitation materials promptly as practicable after
     clearance by the SEC (if applicable) and (D) as soon as practicable
     following the mailing of the proxy materials, submit, or cause to be
     submitted, to the shareholders of each U.S. MLIM Public Fund for a vote at
     a shareholders meeting the proposals described in clause (B) above.

             (ii) In the event that, prior to the Closing, a special
     shareholder meeting for a U.S. MLIM Public Fund described in clause (i)(B)
     above is duly convened but adjourned solely as a result of a failure of
     the requisite quorum in any matter to be present at such meeting (a
     "Quorum Failure"), MLIM Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to,
     or cause a MLIM Company to use reasonable best efforts to, (A) persuade
     the Public Fund Board of each such U.S. Public Fund to approve, in
     conformity with Section 15(a)(4) of the Investment Company Act and SEC
     Rule 15a-4 thereunder, an interim Investment Advisory Arrangement, to be
     effective at the Closing, for any such U.S. Public Fund with any MLIM
     Company containing terms that, taken as a whole, subject to Applicable
     Law, are no less favorable to such MLIM Company than the terms of the
     existing Investment Advisory Arrangement with each such U.S. MLIM Public
     Fund and (B) as promptly as practicable following the adjournment of such
     meeting, persuade any such U.S. Public Fund Board to take such action as
     may be necessary to re-convene a special meeting of the shareholders of
     any such U.S. Public Fund to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable
     following such adjournment for the purpose of obtaining the approval of
     such shareholders of such new Investment Advisory Arrangement as
     contemplated by clause (i) above.

             (iii) BlackRock and MLIM Parent agree that Consent for any
     Investment Advisory Arrangement with a Client that is a U.S. Public Fund
     shall be deemed given for all purposes under this Agreement (but not for
     purposes of the definition of Contingent Account) only if a new Investment
     Advisory Arrangement has been approved by the shareholders of the
     applicable Public Fund in accordance with clause (i) of this subsection
     (a) and Applicable Law and is in full force and effect at the Closing,
     unless any time prior to the Closing any Public Fund Board indicates,
     either orally or in writing, that the applicable Public Fund has (A)
     terminated or intends to terminate (in whole or in part) its existing or
     new Investment Advisory Arrangement prior to or following the Closing or
     (B) could reasonably be expected to terminate its Investment Advisory
     Arrangement or withdraw assets thereunder unless the fees payable under
     such Contract or the overall expense level for the applicable Public Fund
     is reduced prior to or following the Closing.

             (iv) MLIM Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, or use
     its reasonable best efforts to cause the MLIM Companies to, in accordance
     with Applicable Law, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof,
     obtain such approvals, consents or other actions, if any, by the boards of
     directors or comparable governing bodies, regulating or self-regulating
     authorities or shareholders required by Applicable Law or the arrangements
     governing such Public Fund of such MLIM Company's services therefore of
     any Public Fund that is not a U.S. Public Fund so that after the Closing
     the relevant MLIM Company may continue managing such Public Fund on terms,
     taken as a whole, that are no less favorable to such Controlled Affiliate
     than the terms of the existing Investment Advisory Arrangement between
     such non-U.S. Public Fund and such MLIM Company.

         (b)  Non-Public Funds and Non-Fund Clients.

             (i) If Consent or other action is required by Applicable Law or by
     the Investment Advisory Arrangement of any Client other than a Public Fund
     for the Investment Advisory Arrangement with such Client to continue after
     Closing, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, MLIM Parent
     shall, or shall cause a MLIM Company to, send a notice complying with
     Applicable Law and the terms of such Client's Investment Advisory
     Arrangement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to BlackRock (the
     "Notice") informing such Client of the Transactions and requesting such
     Consent in writing or other required action.

             (ii) BlackRock and MLIM Parent agree that any Consent required for
     any Investment Advisory Arrangement with a Client (other than a Public
     Fund) to continue after the Closing shall be deemed given for all purposes
     under this Agreement (but not for purposes of the definition of Contingent
     Accounts) (A) if written Consent is required under Applicable Law or the
     respective Investment Advisory Arrangement, upon receipt of the written
     Consent requested in the Notice prior to the Closing Date or (B) if
     Consent other than written Consent is permitted under Applicable Law and
     the respective Investment Advisory Arrangement, (x) upon receipt of a
     written Consent requested in the Notice prior to the Closing Date or (y)
     if no such written Consent is received, if 45 days shall have passed since
     the sending of written notice ("Negative Consent Notice") to such Client
     (which Negative Consent Notice may be included in the Notice) requesting
     written Consent as aforesaid and informing such Client: (I) of the
     intention to complete the Transactions, which will result in a deemed
     assignment of such Client's Investment Advisory Arrangement; (II) of the
     MLIM Transferred Entities' or one of their respective Controlled
     Affiliates' intention to continue to provide the advisory services
     pursuant to the existing Investment Advisory Arrangement with such Client
     after the Closing if such Client does not terminate such agreement prior
     to the Closing; and (III) that the Consent of such Client will be deemed
     to have been granted if such Client continues to accept such advisory
     services for a period of at least 45 days after the sending of the
     Negative Consent Notice without termination; provided that, in any case
     under clause (A) or (B), no Consent shall be deemed to have been given for
     any purpose under this Agreement if (x) at any time prior to the Closing
     such Client indicates, either orally or in writing, that such Client (1)
     has not so consented or has terminated or intends to withdraw its Consent
     or terminate, in whole or in part, its Investment Advisory Arrangement or
     (2) intends to terminate its Investment Advisory Arrangement or withdraw
     assets thereunder unless the fees payable under such Arrangement are
     reduced or (y) such Client is set forth on the schedule referred to in
     Exhibit 5.21(ix).

             (iii) BlackRock shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
     review all Consent materials to be used by the MLIM Companies prior to
     distribution. The MLIM Companies shall promptly upon their receipt make
     available to BlackRock copies of any and all substantive correspondence
     between it and Clients or representatives or counsel of such Clients
     relating to the consent solicitation provided for in this Section 5.8.

         (c) In connection with obtaining the Client Consents and other actions
required by subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 5.8, at all times prior to
the Closing, the MLIM Companies shall take reasonable steps to keep BlackRock
informed of the status of obtaining such Client Consents and, upon BlackRock's
request, make available to BlackRock copies of all such executed Client
Consents and make available for BlackRock's inspection the originals of such
Consents and any related materials, such as telephone logs and other records
relating to the Client Consent process.

         Section 5.9 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each of BlackRock and MLIM Parent shall bear its own direct and
indirect Transaction Expenses, provided that all out-of-pocket expenses and
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the MLIM Companies and the BlackRock Companies
in connection with the procurement or attempted procurement of the Consents
required to be obtained pursuant to Section 5.7, Section 5.8 and, if required,
Section 5.19, and otherwise in connection with the solicitation and
effectuation of Consents of Clients in connection with the Transactions shall
be borne, satisfied and discharged by MLIM Parent.

         Section 5.10 Further Assurances.

         (a) Each party to this Agreement agrees to execute such documents and
other papers and use its reasonable best efforts to perform or cause to be
performed such further acts as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the
Transactions. Following the Closing, upon the reasonable request of any party
or parties hereto, the other parties hereto, as the case may be, agree to
promptly execute and deliver such further instruments of assignment, transfer,
conveyance, endorsement, direction or authorization and other documents as may
be requested to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the Transactions. In no event, however, shall the BlackRock
Parties or any of their Affiliates be required to enter into any closing
agreement pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1503-2(g)(iv)(B)(3).

         (b) MLIM Parent and its Affiliates shall comply with the DCL recapture
provisions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1503-2(g)(2)(vii) with
respect to the DCLs of the UK Entities.

         (c) In the event that MLIM Parent or any of its Affiliates recaptures
any DCL with respect to the MLIM Business, then MLIM Parent and its Affiliates
shall promptly provide the BlackRock Parties with notice, copies of financial
statements, Tax Returns and other such information necessary for the BlackRock
Parties to calculate the reconstituted net operating loss, if any, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1503-2(g)(2)(vii)(E).

         (d) (i) Each BlackRock Party will, and will procure that each
Subsidiary of each BlackRock Party (including any entity that is as of the MLIM
Contribution, or becomes after the MLIM Contribution, a Subsidiary of any
BlackRock Party) will (i) not take any action that would violate any agreement
regarding the DCLs of the UK Entities entered into with the UK HRMC
substantially in the form of Exhibit 5.10 (d) attached to this Agreement (the
"HRMC Agreement"), and (ii) not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
interest in any UK Entity on terms that would violate the HRMC Agreement. For
so long as controlled by New BlackRock, each BlackRock Party will, and will
procure that each Subsidiary of each BlackRock Party (including any entity that
is as of the MLIM Contribution, or becomes after the MLIM Contribution, a
Subsidiary of any BlackRock Party) will, not voluntarily include, recognize, or
otherwise take any non-U.S. Tax benefit for any losses, deductions, reliefs,
set offs, allowances or credits of any of the UK Entities that arise on or
before the Closing or are attributable to any period ending on or before the
Closing or that part of any period ending after the Closing as occurs on or
before the Closing, and that are provided by MLIM Parent on a schedule to New
BlackRock within 60 days after the Closing. Each BlackRock Party will, and will
procure that each Subsidiary of each BlackRock Party (including any entity that
is as of the MLIM Contribution, or becomes after the MLIM Contribution, a
Subsidiary of any BlackRock Party) will cause any transferee of any sale,
transfer or other disposition of all or a direct or indirect controlling
interest of any UK Entity or UK Entities to assume the obligations under this
Section 5.10(d) with respect to any interests in, or any assets or business of,
such UK Entity or UK Entities transferred to it and consequently the BlackRock
Parties and each Subsidiary of each BlackRock Party shall cease to have any
obligation under this Section 5.10(d) with respect to utilization of non-U.S.
Tax benefits with respect to such transferred interests or assets after such
transfer.

             (ii) If any non-U.S. Governmental Entity attempts to require that
     any BlackRock Party or any Subsidiary of any BlackRock Party (including
     any entity that is as of the MLIM Contribution, or becomes after the MLIM
     Contribution, a Subsidiary of any BlackRock Party) include, recognize or
     otherwise take any non-U.S. Tax benefit for any losses, deductions,
     reliefs, set offs, allowances or credits of any of the UK Entities that
     arise on or before the Closing or are attributable to any period ending on
     or before the Closing or that part of any period ending after the Closing
     as occurs on or before the Closing, and that are provided by MLIM Parent
     on the schedule referred to in (i) above to New BlackRock within 60 days
     after the Closing, then the respective BlackRock Party or Subsidiary of a
     BlackRock Party shall, upon written request by MLIM Parent, grant a power
     of attorney to MLIM Parent to contest such inclusion, recognition or
     taking of a non-U.S. tax benefit. MLIM Parent shall indemnify and hold
     harmless such BlackRock Party or such Subsidiary of a BlackRock Party for
     Losses arising from such contest or the resolution of such contest.

         (e) Each BlackRock Party will, and will procure that each Subsidiary
of each BlackRock Party (including any entity that is as of the Effective Time,
or becomes after the Effective Time, a Subsidiary of any BlackRock Party) will,
not cause directly or indirectly any of the assets or any of the interests in
the UK Entities to be transferred or treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as being transferred to any foreign corporation or any entity treated
as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes within two years
after the Effective Time.

         (f) MLIM Parent shall not take, or cause to be taken, any action after
the date hereof and on or prior to the MLIM Contribution that will cause the
aggregate adjusted tax basis of the amortizable Section 197 intangible assets
as defined in Section 197 of the Code of the UK Entities (the "197
Intangibles"), which is estimated to be (pound)1,181,000,000 as of December 30,
2005, to be reduced, other than through ordinary amortization which annual
amortization is expected to be at the rate of (pound)158,000,000.

         (a) BlackRock agrees that the information and data that is or will be

Affiliates proposed to appear in any registration statement or proxy statement
or any amendment or supplement thereto submitted to the SEC in connection with

file supplements to each Public Fund's prospectus forming a part of its
registration statement, which supplements or amendments shall reflect changes
as necessary in each Public Fund's affairs as a consequence of the Transactions
and (ii) make any other filing necessary under Applicable Law to satisfy
disclosure requirements to enable the public distribution of the shares of that
Public Fund to continue.

         Section 5.12 Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act.

         (a) BlackRock acknowledges that MLIM Parent has entered into this
Agreement in reliance upon the benefits and protections provided by Section
15(f) of the Investment Company Act. In furtherance (and not limitation) of the
foregoing, BlackRock shall conduct its business and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each of its Controlled Affiliates to conduct its business

period of not less than two years after the Closing Date, neither BlackRock nor
any of its Controlled Affiliates shall impose an "unfair burden" (as defined in
the Investment Company Act) on any such Public Fund in connection with the
Transactions.

         (b) MLIM Parent acknowledges that BlackRock, to the extent that the
actions specified in Section 5.19 are necessary to comply with Regulatory
Requirements, has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the benefits and
protections provided by Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act. In

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.12 are
intended only for the benefit of the parties and holders of their respective
equity interests immediately prior to the Closing and for no other Person.

         Section 5.13 Ancillary Agreements. Each of BlackRock, New BlackRock
and MLIM Parent agree to negotiate in good faith and, on or prior to the
Closing Date, to enter into each Ancillary Agreement to which such Person is a

thereto shall agree.

         Section 5.14 Employees.

         (a) Generally. Effective as of the Closing Date BlackRock will adopt
compensation and employee benefits taking into account then current market and
competitive practices and compensation and benefits made available to BlackRock
Employees and MLIM Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each MLIM
Employee providing services to the MLIM Business and employed on the Closing
Date (each such employee, a "Continuing Employee"), shall become a BlackRock
Employee effective as of the Closing Date. BlackRock shall provide each
Continuing Employee with compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially similar to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly
situated BlackRock Employees; provided, however, that this Section 5.14(a)
shall not be construed to limit the ability of BlackRock to terminate the
employment of any Continuing Employee at any time.

         (b) Service Credit and Transition of Benefits Generally. For purposes
of eligibility and vesting under the employee benefit plans of the BlackRock
Companies, the MLIM Companies, and their respective Affiliates providing
benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Closing (the "New Plans"), and
for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance
benefits under New Plans, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with the MLIM Companies and their respective Affiliates
(and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing,
to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the
Closing, to credit for such service under any similar MLIM Parent Benefit Plan.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable MLIM Parent Benefit Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, BlackRock shall cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and
BlackRock shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his
or her covered dependents under a MLIM Parent Benefit Plan during the portion
of the plan year of the New Plan ending on the date such employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

         (c) Treatment of Certain Benefit Plans. As of the Closing, Continuing
Employees shall cease to be covered by the MLIM Parent Benefit Plans other than
Assumed Benefit Plans; provided that MLIM Parent shall retain responsibility
for all claims under any MLIM Parent Benefit Plans incurred by Continuing
Employees prior to the Effective Time. BlackRock shall be responsible for all
claims under any New Plan. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim shall be
deemed to have been incurred when the medical or other service giving rise to
the claim is performed, except that disability claims shall be deemed to have
been incurred on the date the Continuing Employee becomes disabled. As of the
Effective Time, Continuing Employees shall no longer actively participate in
the Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. 401(k) Savings & Investment Plan. MLIM Parent
shall cause the accounts of Continuing Employees under the Merrill Lynch, &
Co., Inc. 401(k) Savings & Investment Plan to be fully vested as of the
Effective Time. BlackRock shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, designate a
tax-qualified defined contribution plan of BlackRock or one of its Affiliates
(such plan(s), the "BlackRock Savings Plan") that either (i) currently provides
for the receipt from Continuing Employees of "eligible rollover distributions"
(as such term is defined under Section 402 of the Code) or (ii) shall be
amended as soon as practicable following the Effective Time to provide for the
receipt from the Continuing Employees of eligible rollover distributions. As
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, (x) BlackRock shall provide
MLIM Parent with such documents and other information as MLIM Parent shall
reasonably request to assure itself that the BlackRock Savings Plan provides
for the receipt of eligible rollover distributions and (y) MLIM Parent shall
provide BlackRock with such documents and other information as BlackRock shall
reasonably request to assure itself that the accounts of the Continuing
Employees would be eligible rollover distributions. Each Continuing Employee
who is a participant in the Merrill Lynch, & Co., Inc. 401(k) Savings and
Investment Plan. shall be given the opportunity to receive a distribution of
his or her account balance and shall be given the opportunity to elect to "roll
over" such account balance to the BlackRock Savings Plan, subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of such plan(s) and Applicable Law.

         (d) Severance Benefits. MLIM Parent shall be solely liable for all
severance or similar liabilities incurred or arising prior to the Closing under
any MLIM Parent Benefit Plans, Assumed Benefit Plans, any other arrangement or
obligations of the MLIM Companies or under the Applicable Laws of any country,
including without limitation any applicable works council agreements or
collective bargaining agreements.

         (e) None of the provisions of this Section 5.14 shall be construed to
prevent the termination of employment of any Continuing Employee after the
Closing or the amendment or termination of any particular Assumed Benefit Plan
to the extent permitted by its terms as in effect immediately before the
Closing.

         Section 5.15 BlackRock Registration Statement.

         (a) BlackRock shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy
statement/prospectus (the "BlackRock Registration Statement") in connection
with the required affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
BlackRock Common Stock (the "Required BlackRock Stockholder Vote") as to the
Merger, the issuance of New BlackRock Common Stock as Merger consideration, and
the issuance of the MLIM Consideration. BlackRock shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the BlackRock Registration/Proxy Statement declared effective
by the SEC as soon as possible following the initial filing thereof with the
SEC. MLIM Parent shall furnish all information concerning it and its Affiliates
(including, without limitation, audited and unaudited financial statements and
other financial and business information regarding MLIM Business Entities and
the MLIM Business), as BlackRock may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the BlackRock Registration Statement.

         (b) Each of MLIM Parent and BlackRock agrees, as to itself and its
Controlled Affiliates, that none of the information to be supplied by it or its
Controlled Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
BlackRock Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will,
at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the time or times of the
BlackRock Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the date of the
BlackRock Stockholders Meeting any information relating to MLIM Parent,
BlackRock or any of their Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by BlackRock or MLIM Parent that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the BlackRock Registration Statement, so that such document
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the
other party and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed promptly by
BlackRock with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated by
BlackRock to stockholders of BlackRock.

         (c) BlackRock will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the proxy
statement and prospectus included in the definitive BlackRock Registration
Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement.

         (d) BlackRock will take, in accordance with Applicable Law and its
Organizational Documents (but subject to the fiduciary obligations of the Board
of Directors of BlackRock), all action necessary to hold a meeting of the
holders of the BlackRock Class A Common Stock and BlackRock Class B Common
Stock at which the holders of such stock will consider the issuance of New
BlackRock Shares as MLIM Consideration and the Merger (including any
adjournments or postponements thereof, the "BlackRock Stockholders Meeting") as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement. Subject to the terms
of this Agreement and subject to its fiduciary obligations under Applicable
Law, the Board of Directors of BlackRock shall recommend to BlackRock's
stockholders the approval of such matters and shall use reasonable best efforts
to solicit such approval.

five Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, MLIM Parent shall, at
MLIM Parent's expense, prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to
BlackRock:

             (i) an estimated combined balance sheet of the MLIM Transferred
     Entities and their Subsidiaries, giving pro forma effect to the MLIM
     Restructuring as of immediately prior to the scheduled Closing (the
     "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), prepared in accordance with the MLIM
     Financial Statement Principles; and

             (ii) a calculation in reasonable detail based upon such Estimated
     Closing Balance Sheet and the books and records of MLIM Parent and its
     Subsidiaries setting forth the Closing Financial Information and the
     estimated Closing Adjustment Amounts, in each case as of immediately prior
     to the scheduled Closing after giving effect to the MLIM Restructuring.

         The MLIM Companies shall give, and shall cause their respective
advisers to give, BlackRock and its advisors reasonable access to such books,
records and personnel of the MLIM Companies (including materials related to the
preparation of any applicable income statements and the work papers of MLIM
Parent and its accountants relating to the preparation of the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Financial Information delivered pursuant to this
Section 5.16(a), and such calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amounts) as may
be necessary to enable BlackRock and its advisors to assess the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Financial Information and such calculation
of the Closing Adjustment Amounts prior to the Closing.

         (b) Closing Date Capital Contribution. On the Closing Date, prior to
the Effective Time, MLIM Parent shall make a contribution (in addition to the
MLIM Contribution), in cash or in cash equivalents, to the MLIM Transferred
Entities, in an amount equal to:

             (i) if each of the Estimated Adjustment Amounts is a negative
     value, the greater of the absolute values of such Estimated Adjustment
     Amounts; or

             (ii) if either of the Estimated Adjustment Amounts is a negative
     value and the other Estimated Adjustment Amount is a positive value, the
     absolute value of such negative Estimated Adjustment Amount.

         (c) Preparation of Final Closing Financial Information. As promptly as
practicable, but no later than 30 days after the Closing Date, BlackRock shall,
at its own expense, prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to MLIM
Parent:

             (i) a combined balance sheet of the MLIM Transferred Entities and
     their Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as of immediately prior to
     the Effective Time after giving effect to the MLIM Restructuring and to
     any capital contribution made pursuant to Section 5.16(b) (the "Final
     Closing Balance Sheet"), prepared in accordance with the MLIM Financial
     Statement Principles; and

             (ii) a calculation in reasonable detail, based upon such Final
     Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Financial Information and the books and
     records of MLIM Parent and its Subsidiaries and the MLIM Transferred
     Entities and their Subsidiaries, setting forth the Closing Adjustment
     Amounts, in each case as of immediately prior to the Closing after giving
     effect to the MLIM Restructuring.

         The MLIM Companies shall give, and shall cause their respective
advisers to give, BlackRock and its advisors reasonable access to such books,
records and personnel of the MLIM Companies (including materials related to the
preparation of any applicable income statements and the work papers of MLIM
Parent and its accountants) as may be necessary to enable BlackRock and its
advisors to confirm the Closing Financial Information and to prepare the Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the other information contemplated by this Section
5.16(c).

         MLIM Parent shall have 45 days from the date on which such Final
Closing Balance Sheet and such calculations are delivered to it to assess such
Final Closing Balance Sheet (the "Review Period"). MLIM Parent and its
accountants and advisers shall be provided with reasonable access to the work
papers of BlackRock and its accountants relating to the Final Closing Balance
Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amounts in connection with
such review. If MLIM Parent believes that the Final Closing Balance Sheet or
the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amounts were not prepared in
accordance with this Section 5.16, MLIM Parent may, on or prior to the last day
of the Review Period, deliver a notice to BlackRock setting forth, in
reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount and the basis for MLIM Parent's
disagreement therewith, together with supporting calculations (the "Dispute
Notice"). Following delivery of a Dispute Notice to BlackRock, BlackRock and
its accountants and advisers shall be provided with reasonable access to the
work papers of MLIM Parent and its accountants relating to the calculation of
the Closing Adjustment Amounts as set forth in such Dispute Notice. If no
Dispute Notice is received by BlackRock on or prior to the last day of the
Review Period or if MLIM Parent at any time during such 45-day period notifies
BlackRock in writing that MLIM Parent does not disagree with any amounts set
forth in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the Final Closing Balance Sheet
and the Closing Adjustment Amounts as prepared and calculated by BlackRock as
set forth in BlackRock's certificate shall be deemed accepted by MLIM Parent
and shall be final and binding on BlackRock and MLIM Parent. If a Dispute
Notice is received by BlackRock on or prior to the last day of the Review
Period, MLIM Parent and BlackRock shall, during the 30-day period following the
date of such notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt to resolve their
differences in good faith, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive.

         (d) Accountant's Review. If, at the conclusion of the Resolution
Period, there are amounts remaining in dispute with respect to the calculation
of the Closing Adjustment Amounts as to which a valid Dispute Notice has been
timely delivered to BlackRock, BlackRock and MLIM Parent shall jointly retain
such internationally-recognized independent accounting firm as BlackRock and
MLIM Parent may mutually agree (the "Accountant") to resolve any remaining
issues set forth in the Dispute Notice. The Accountant shall conduct its review
of such issues, any related work papers of the parties or their accountants and
any supporting documentation, and hear such presentations by the parties, as
the Accountant deems necessary.

         (e) Adjustment Report. BlackRock and MLIM Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to agree upon and retain the Accountant as
promptly as practicable following the end of the Resolution Period and to
cooperate with one another and the Accountant to resolve the issues set forth
in the Dispute Notice no later than 45 days following the date of the
Accountant's retention so that the Accountant may deliver to MLIM Parent and
BlackRock a report (the "Adjustment Report") setting forth the adjustments, if
any, that should be made to the disputed Final Closing Balance Sheet or
BlackRock's proposed calculation of the final Closing Adjustment Amounts. The
fees, expenses and costs of the Accountant for the services described herein
shall be allocated between MLIM Parent and BlackRock in the same proportion
that the aggregate amount of the items unsuccessfully disputed by each (as
finally determined by the Accountant) bears to the total amount of the disputed
items. Each of BlackRock and MLIM Parent shall promptly reimburse the other to
the extent the other paid more than the amount so required pursuant to the
preceding sentence. The Adjustment Report shall be final and binding upon
BlackRock and MLIM Parent, and shall be deemed a final arbitration award that
is enforceable in any court having jurisdiction.

         (f) Final Resolution. Effective upon (i) the end of the Review Period
(if a timely Dispute Notice is not delivered), (ii) the resolution of all
matters set forth in the Dispute Notice by agreement of the parties (if a
timely Dispute Notice is delivered) or (iii) the issuance of the Adjustment
Report (the "Resolution Date"), the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Adjustment Amounts shall be adjusted if and to the extent necessary to reflect
the final resolution of any disputed items and shall be final and binding on
BlackRock and MLIM Parent.

         (g) Distribution in Respect of Final Balance Sheet Adjustment.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1(b)(ii), the MLIM Transferred
Entities may declare, as a distribution to each of the Persons who are holders
of record of the MLIM Transferred Interests immediately prior to the Effective
Time, an obligation, which shall be payable by Wire Transfer on the third
Business Day after the Resolution Date, in an amount equal to, if each of the
Final Adjustment Amounts is a positive value, the lesser of such Amounts, with
interest, from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of such
payment, at the Specified Rate. BlackRock shall cause each of such obligations
to be paid and satisfied in full in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Section 5.16(g). (h) Contribution in Respect of Final Balance Sheet
Adjustment. MLIM Parent shall pay to BlackRock, by Wire Transfer, on the third

     the greater of the absolute values of such Amounts; or

     and the other Final Adjustment Amount is a positive value, the absolute

Section 5.19 are necessary to comply with Regulatory Requirements, and subject
in each case to the requirements of Applicable Law and the fiduciary duties of
the BlackRock Parties and the U.S. BlackRock Public Funds Boards,

             (i) BlackRock shall use its reasonable best efforts to, or use its
     reasonable best efforts to cause its Controlled Affiliates to, in
     accordance with Applicable Law, (A) as promptly as practicable following

     Board of a new Investment Advisory Arrangement, to be effective at the
     Closing, containing terms, taken as a whole, that are no less favorable to

     following receipt of the approval described in clause (A) above, cause
     each U.S. BlackRock Public Fund Board to call a special meeting of the

     practicable for the purpose of obtaining the requisite approval of such
     shareholders for such new Investment Advisory Arrangement, as applicable,
     (C) as promptly as practicable following receipt of the approval described
     in clause (A) above, prepare and file, or cause each U.S. BlackRock Public

     to be submitted, to the shareholders of each U.S. BlackRock Public Fund
     for a vote at a shareholders meeting the proposals described in clause (B)

             (ii) In the event that prior to the Closing, a special shareholder
     meeting for a U.S. BlackRock Public Fund described in clause (i)(B) above
     is duly convened but adjourned solely as a result of a Quorum Failure,
     BlackRock shall use its reasonable best efforts to, or cause one of its
     Controlled Affiliates to, (A) persuade the Public Fund Board of each such
     U.S. Public Fund to approve, in conformity with Section 15(a)(4) of the
     Investment Company Act and SEC Rule 15a-4 thereunder, an interim
     Investment Advisory Arrangement, to be effective at the Closing, for any
     such U.S. Public Fund with BlackRock or any of its Controlled Affiliates
     containing terms that, taken as a whole, subject to Applicable Law, are no
     less favorable to BlackRock or such BlackRock Controlled Affiliate than
     the terms of the existing Investment Advisory Arrangement with each such
     U.S. BlackRock Public Fund and (B) as promptly as practicable following
     the adjournment of such meeting, persuade any such U.S. Public Fund Board
     to take such action as may be necessary to re-convene a special meeting of
     the shareholders of any such U.S. Public Fund to be held as promptly as
     reasonably practicable following such adjournment for the purpose of
     obtaining the approval of such shareholders of such new Investment
     Advisory Arrangement as contemplated by clause (i) above.

             (iii) MLIM Parent and BlackRock agree that Consent for any
     Investment Advisory Arrangement with a Client that is a U.S. Public Fund
     shall be deemed given for all purposes under this Agreement only if a new
     Investment Advisory Arrangement has been approved by the shareholders of
     the applicable Public Fund in accordance with clause (i) of this
     subsection (a) and Applicable Law and is in full force and effect at the
     Closing, unless any time prior to the Closing any Public Fund Board
     indicates, either orally or in writing, that the applicable Public Fund
     has (A) terminated or intends to terminate (in whole or in part) its
     existing or new Investment Advisory Arrangement prior to or following the
     Closing or (B) could reasonably be expected to terminate its Investment
     Advisory Arrangement or withdraw assets thereunder unless the fees payable
     under such Contract or the overall expense level for the applicable Public
     Fund is reduced prior to or following the Closing.

             (iv) BlackRock shall use its reasonable best efforts to, or use
     its reasonable best efforts to cause its Controlled Affiliates to, in
     accordance with Applicable Law, as promptly as practicable following the
     date hereof, obtain such approvals, consents or other actions, if any, by
     the boards of directors or comparable governing bodies, regulating or
     self-regulating authorities or shareholders required by Applicable Law or
     the arrangements governing such Public Fund of such BlackRock Controlled
     Affiliate's services therefore of any Public Fund that is not a U.S.
     Public Fund so that after the Closing the relevant Controlled Affiliate of
     BlackRock may continue managing such Public Fund on terms, taken as a
     whole, that are no less favorable to such Controlled Affiliate than the
     terms of the existing Investment Advisory Arrangement between such
     non-U.S. Public Fund and such Controlled Affiliate.

         (b)    Non-Public Funds and Non-Fund Clients.

             (i) If Consent or other action is required by Applicable Law or by
     the Investment Advisory Arrangement of any Client other than a Public Fund
     for the Investment Advisory Arrangement with such Client to continue after
     Closing, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, BlackRock
     shall, or shall cause one of its Controlled Affiliates to, send a notice
     complying with Applicable Law and the terms of such Client's Investment
     Advisory Arrangement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to MLIM
     Parent (the "BlackRock Notice") informing such Client of the Transactions
     and requesting such Consent in writing or other required action.

             (ii) MLIM Parent and BlackRock agree that any Consent required for
     any Investment Advisory Arrangement with a Client of BlackRock (other than
     a Public Fund) to continue after the Closing shall be deemed given for all
     purposes under this Agreement (A) if written Consent is required under
     Applicable Law or the respective Investment Advisory Arrangement, upon
     receipt of the written Consent requested in the BlackRock Notice prior to
     the Closing Date or (B) if Consent other than written Consent is permitted
     under Applicable Law and the respective Investment Advisory Arrangement,
     (x) upon receipt of a written Consent requested in the BlackRock Notice
     prior to the Closing Date or (y) if no such written Consent is received,
     if 45 days shall have passed since the sending of written notice
     ("BlackRock Negative Consent Notice") to such Client (which Negative
     Consent Notice may be included in the BlackRock Notice) requesting written
     Consent as aforesaid and informing such Client: (I) of the intention to
     complete the Transactions, which will result in a deemed assignment of
     such Client's Investment Advisory Arrangement; (II) of BlackRock's or a
     BlackRock Controlled Affiliate's intention to continue to provide the
     advisory services pursuant to the existing Investment Advisory Arrangement
     with such Client after the Closing if such Client does not terminate such
     agreement prior to the Closing; and (III) that the Consent of such Client
     will be deemed to have been granted if such Client continues to accept
     such advisory services for a period of at least 45 days after the sending
     of the BlackRock Negative Consent Notice without termination; provided,
     that, in any case under clause (A) or (B), no Consent shall be deemed to
     have been given for any purpose under this Agreement if at any time prior
     to the Closing such Client indicates, either orally or in writing, that
     such Client (1) has not so consented or has terminated or intends to
     withdraw its Consent or terminate, in whole or in part, its Investment
     Advisory Arrangement or (2) intends to terminate its Investment Advisory
     Arrangement or withdraw assets thereunder unless the fees payable under
     such Arrangement are reduced.

             (iii) MLIM Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
     review all Consent materials to be used by BlackRock or a Controlled
     Affiliate of BlackRock prior to distribution. BlackRock shall, and shall
     cause each of its Controlled Affiliate to, promptly upon their receipt
     make available to MLIM Parent copies of any and all substantive
     correspondence between it and Clients or representatives or counsel of
     such Clients relating to the consent solicitation provided for in this
     Section 5.19.

         (c) In connection with obtaining the Client Consents and other actions
required by subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 5.19, at all times prior to
the Closing, BlackRock shall take reasonable steps to keep MLIM Parent informed
of the status of obtaining such Client Consents and, upon MLIM Parent's
request, make available to MLIM Parent copies of all such executed Client
Consents and make available for MLIM Parent's inspection the originals of such
Consents and any related materials, such as telephone logs and other records
relating to the Client Consent process.

         Section 5.20 Contingent Accounts. BlackRock and MLIM Parent shall on
or prior to the Closing Measurement Date agree on a list of all Contingent

Sections 6.1(f) and (g).

the Closing Date, MLIM Parent and BlackRock shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take such steps as may be necessary to cause New BlackRock, after
giving effect to the Transaction, not to have any ownership position in
securities that would be reasonably likely to cause or result in a violation of
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Change in Bank Control Act or Section
10 of the Home Owners Loan Act and shall take no action and shall cause its
Controlled Affiliates to take no action inconsistent with the foregoing.

warranties of BlackRock set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct

indirectly, arising out of, attributable to or resulting from:

         (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and
warranties where such representations and warranties are read without giving
effect to any qualifiers or exceptions relating to materiality and MLIM
Material Adverse Effect made by MLIM Parent herein or under any of the
Ancillary Agreements in connection herewith or therewith;

         (c) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by MLIM
Parent or, prior to the Closing, by any MLIM Company to any brokers, financial
advisors or comparable other person retained or employed by it in connection
with the Transactions; or

         (d) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any alleged
or actual breach, failure to comply, violation or other deficiency in any
respect of any Regulatory Requirement or Fiduciary Requirement or any
Proceeding related thereto or instituted thereunder by any Person to the extent

Affiliate, or any Fund in existence at or during any time prior to the Closing
or any other Person that is an Affiliate of the MLIM Companies at any time
prior to the Closing (including their respective employees, officers, members,
directors, agents and representatives). For the avoidance of doubt, the
indemnification provided for under this clause (d) is intended to be absolute,
to not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1, 7.3 or 7.4, and
to be unaffected by any disclosure (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in
the MLIM Parent Disclosure Letters), investigation, publicly available
information, notice or state of knowledge in respect of the matters covered
hereby whether in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement or otherwise.

         (e) (i) any obligation (including any payment required to be made) in
connection with a defined benefit or final salary pension scheme by any MLIM
Company in respect of any funding shortfall in any such scheme as at Closing or
in respect of the termination of participation in any such scheme as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) any other liability
in relation to such a scheme as at Closing, in excess of any contributions to
such a scheme after Closing in respect of the ongoing employment after Closing
of any Person who is a beneficiary of such a scheme and in the employment of
any MLIM Transferred Entity or any of its Controlled Affiliates that would be
made to a scheme that was fully funded as at Closing and not subject to any
termination of participation as a result of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement.

         (f) Any unfunded commitment in respect of off balance sheet
arrangements listed on Schedule 7.2(f) of the MLIM Parent Disclosure Letter, to
the extent that there shall be a capital call in respect thereof prior to
January 1, 2007.

         Section 7.3 Minimum Losses. Except with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties contained in the Specified Provisions and in
Sections 3.21 and 3.24, no BlackRock Indemnitee under Section 7.2 shall have
any right to indemnification under Section 7.2(a) except to the extent
aggregate Losses other than Minor Losses incurred by all BlackRock Indemnitees
under Section 7.2(a) would exceed $100,000,000 (the "Deductible"). In the event
that such Losses other than Minor Losses exceed the Deductible, only such
Losses other than Minor Losses in excess of $100,000,000 shall be recoverable
in accordance with the terms hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Deductible
shall not apply to any matters under Section 7.2(b) through (f).

         Section 7.4 Maximum Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (other than the proviso to section 7.9), in no event
shall MLIM Parent be obligated to provide indemnification payments pursuant to
Section 7.2(a) exceeding, in the aggregate, an amount (the "Cap") equal to
$1,600,000,000; provided, however, that such limitation on indemnification
shall not apply with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in the Specified Provisions and in Sections 3.21 and 3.24. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Cap shall not apply to any matters under Section 7.2(b)
through (f).

         Section 7.5 Obligations of BlackRock. Subject to the other provisions
of this Article VII, BlackRock shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless MLIM
Parent and its Affiliates (excluding BlackRock and its Controlled Affiliates
and the MLIM Transferred Entities and their Controlled Affiliates after the
Closing), their respective predecessors and successors, and their respective
stockholders, employees, officers, partners, members, trustees (including
trustees of Public Funds), directors (including directors of Public Funds),
agents and representatives (each, a "MLIM Indemnified Party") from and against,
and pay or reimburse such MLIM Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses
(excluding any Taxes or Losses related to Taxes and excluding any Minor Losses)
that any of them may suffer, incur or sustain, directly or indirectly, arising
out of, attributable to or resulting from:

         (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.8, 4.9, 4.11 and 4.12 where such
representations and warranties are read without giving effect to any qualifiers
or exceptions relating to materiality and BlackRock Material Adverse Effect
made by BlackRock herein;

         (b) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any alleged
or actual breach, failure to comply, violation or other deficiency in any
respect of any Regulatory Requirement or Fiduciary Requirement or any
Proceeding related thereto or instituted thereunder by any Person to the extent
arising out of, attributable to, relating to or resulting from the ownership,
operation or conduct of the business of BlackRock and the BlackRock Controlled
Affiliates (including their respective employees, officers, members, directors,
agents and representatives) prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt,
the indemnification provided for under this clause (b) is intended to be
absolute, to not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1, 7.6 or
7.7, and to be unaffected by any disclosure (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, in the disclosure schedules of the BlackRock Parties), investigation,
publicly available information, notice or state of knowledge in respect of the
matters covered hereby whether in connection with the negotiation and execution
of this Agreement or otherwise; or

         (c) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by BlackRock
to any brokers, financial advisors or comparable other person retained or
employed by it in connection with the Transactions.

         Section 7.6 Minimum Losses. No MLIM Indemnitee under Section 7.5 shall
have any right to indemnification under Section 7.5(a) except to the extent
aggregate Losses other than Minor Losses incurred by all MLIM Indemnitees under
Section 7.5(a) would exceed $100,000,000 (the "BlackRock Deductible"). In the
event that such Losses in excess of $100,000,000 exceed the BlackRock
Deductible, only such Losses other than Minor Losses in excess of $100,000,000
shall be recoverable in accordance with the terms hereof. For the avoidance of
doubt, the BlackRock Deductible shall not apply to any matters under Sections
7.5(b) and (c).

         Section 7.7 Maximum Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (other than the proviso to section 7.9), in no event
shall PNC be obligated to provide indemnification payments pursuant to (i)
Section 7.5(a) exceeding, in the aggregate, an amount (the "Cap") equal to
$1,600,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the Cap shall not apply to any
matters under Sections 7.2(b) and (c).

         Section 7.8 Obligation to Mitigate. No claim may be asserted nor may
any Proceedings be commenced against any Indemnifying Party pursuant Section
7.2 or Section 7.5 to the extent that the Indemnification Parties establish
that (i) the Indemnified Party had a reasonable opportunity, but failed, in
good faith to mitigate the Loss or (ii) such Loss arises from or was caused by
actions taken or failed to be taken by the Indemnified Party after the Closing.

         Section 7.9 Exclusive Remedy. After the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of any party for any inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty or any breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
and required to be performed prior to or after the Closing shall be the
indemnification contained in this Article VII and in Article VIII; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
party waives any rights to pursue a claim for fraud or any remedy therefor or
to seek specific performance for a breach of a covenant or agreement to be
performed by it before or after the Closing.

         Section 7.10 Notice; Procedure for Third-Party Claims. Except for
indemnification of Tax Claims which are governed by Article VIII:

         (a) Any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an
"Indemnified Party") may seek indemnification for any Loss by giving written
notice to the applicable party or parties from whom indemnification is sought
(the "Indemnifying Party"), specifying in detail (i) the representation and
warranty or covenant or other agreement that is alleged to have been
inaccurate, to have been breached or to have given rise to indemnification,
(ii) if known, the facts constituting the basis for such allegation and (iii)
if known, the aggregate amount of the Losses for which a claim is being made
under this Article VII or, to the extent that such Losses are not known or have
not been incurred at the time such claim is made, an estimate, to be prepared
in good faith and accompanied by supporting documentation, of the aggregate
potential amount of such Losses. In the event that any claim for
indemnification hereunder results from or is in connection with a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall provide written notice of such Third-Party
Claim to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable after the Indemnified
Party first receives notice of the claim but in any event not later than 10
Business Days prior to the time any response to the asserted claim is required;
provided that the Indemnified Party shall not be limited in seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Article VII by any failure to provide such
notice of the existence of a claim to the applicable Indemnifying Party except
to the extent (and only to the extent) that (x) such failure results in a lack
of actual notice to the Indemnifying Party and (y) such Indemnifying Party
actually incurs an incremental expense or has otherwise been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

         (b) Third-Party Claims.

             (i) Except as otherwise provided in clause (ii) of this subsection
     (b), in the case of any claim asserted by a Person that is not a party to
     this Agreement or an Affiliate Controlled by a party to this Agreement
     against an Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified
     Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such
     Indemnifying Party) to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party
     Claim and any Proceedings resulting therefrom; provided that (x) counsel
     for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the defense of such claim or
     litigation shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and
     (y) the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such
     Indemnified Party's sole cost and expense (including the costs and
     expenses of counsel). Except with the prior written consent of the
     Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
     delayed, no Indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or
     enter into any settlement of any Third-Party Claim or related Proceedings,
     unless such judgment or settlement relates solely to monetary damages and
     provides for a full, unconditional and irrevocable release by such third
     party of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates and, in the reasonable
     good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, does not and would not
     reasonably be expected to adversely impact or impair the business or
     reputation of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates.

             (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i) above, in the event that the
     Indemnified Parties shall in good faith determine that the Indemnified
     Parties may have available to them one or more defenses or counterclaims
     that are inconsistent with one or more of the defenses or counterclaims
     that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of a
     Third-Party Claim or any Proceeding relating thereto, (A) the Indemnified
     Parties shall have the right, at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party
     (including the costs and expenses of counsel for the Indemnified Parties
     (provided that the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay for more
     than one counsel in any jurisdiction for all Indemnified Parties in
     connection with any such Third-Party Claim and related Proceedings)), at
     all times to take over and assume control over the defense and prosecution
     of such portion of such Third-Party Claim and related Proceedings related
     to such inconsistent defenses and counterclaims and (B) the Indemnifying
     Party shall retain control over the defense and prosecution of the
     remaining aspects of such Third-Party Claim and related Proceeding;
     provided that, in the case where the Indemnified Parties have assumed
     control of the defense and prosecution of such portion of such Third-Party
     Claim and related Proceeding related to such inconsistent defenses and
     counterclaims, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party
     may settle such claim or Proceeding without the written consent of the
     other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In
     the event that the Indemnified Party does not assume the defense of any
     matter as provided above in clause (A), the Indemnifying Party shall have
     the right to control the defense against any such Third-Party Claim or
     related Proceeding, provided that (1) subject to the control of the
     prosecution and defense of such Third-Party Claim by the Indemnifying
     Party and its counsel, the Indemnified Parties and their counsel (which
     shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) shall be kept
     fully informed as to all material aspects of such Third-Party Claim and
     related Proceedings and shall have the right to participate in the
     prosecution and defense of such Third-Party Claim, (2) the Indemnifying
     Party and its counsel shall promptly provide to the Indemnified Parties
     and their counsel all material information related to such Third-Party
     Claim and related Proceedings (including copies of written information),
     (3) the Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall have their views
     regarding such Third-Party Claim considered in good faith by the
     Indemnifying Party and its counsel and (4) the Indemnified Parties and
     their counsel shall have the right to consent, such consent not be
     unreasonably withheld, to the settlement or compromise of such Third-Party
     Claim and related Proceedings.

             (iii) Subject to clause (ii) of this Section 7.10(b), in the event
     that an Indemnified Party determines in good faith that any Third-Party
     Claim or any Proceeding related thereto has had or could reasonably be
     expected to materially adversely impact or impair the commercial interests
     or business reputation of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, (1)
     counsel to be utilized by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such
     Third-Party Claim and related Proceeding shall be reasonably acceptable to
     the Indemnified Parties, (2) subject to the control of the prosecution and
     defense of such Third-Party Claim by the Indemnifying Party and its
     counsel, the Indemnified Parties and their counsel (which shall be
     reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) shall be kept fully
     informed as to all material aspects of such Third-Party Claim and related
     Proceedings and shall have the right to participate fully in the
     prosecution and defense of such Third-Party Claim, (3) the Indemnifying
     Party and its counsel shall promptly provide to the Indemnified Parties
     and their counsel all material information related to such Third-Party
     Claim and related Proceedings (including copies of written information),
     (4) the Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall have their views
     regarding such Third-Party Claim considered in good faith by the
     Indemnifying Party and its counsel, and (5) the Indemnified Parties and
     their counsel shall have the right to consent, such consent not be
     unreasonably withheld, to the settlement or compromise of such Third-Party
     Claim and related Proceedings.

             (iv) In any event, MLIM Parent and BlackRock shall reasonably
     cooperate in the investigation, pre-trial activities, trial, compromise,
     settlement, discharge and defense of any Third-Party Claim subject to this
     Article VII and the records and employees of each shall be made reasonably
     available to the other with respect to such defense.

         Section 7.11 Survival of Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article VII, no Indemnified Party shall have any right to
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or 7.5(a) with respect to any matter
as to which written notice satisfying the requirements of Section 7.10(a) shall
not have been provided by the Indemnified Party to the applicable Indemnifying
Party during the 18-month period following the Closing Date; provided that a
notice with respect to any right to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(b)
through (f) or Section 7.5(b) and (c) or with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties contained in the Specified Provisions may be
given at any time and a notice with respect to breaches of representations and
warranties contained in Sections 3.21 may be given at any time prior to the
date that is six (6) months following the expiration of the applicable
statutory period of limitations (including any extensions thereof); provided,
further, that obligations to indemnify pursuant to Section 7.2(b) and (c)
through (f) and Section 7.5(b) and (c) shall not terminate. Any matter as to
which a claim has been asserted by written notice satisfying the requirements
of Section 7.10(a) and within the time limitation applicable by reason of the
immediately preceding sentence that is pending or unresolved at the end of any
applicable limitation period under this Article VII or the statute of
limitations applicable to such claim shall continue to be covered by this
Article VII notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitations (which the
parties hereby waive solely with respect to such circumstances) or the
expiration date described in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section
7.11 until such matter is finally terminated or otherwise resolved by the
parties under this Agreement, by a court of competent jurisdiction and any
amounts payable hereunder are finally determined and paid.

         Section 7.12 Subrogation. The rights of any Indemnifying Party shall
be subrogated to any right of action that the Indemnified Party may have
against any other person with respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder.

         Section 7.13 Interest on Indemnity Claim. To the extent that any party
(the "Payee Party") becomes entitled to recover all or a portion of any Loss
under this Article VII, such Payee Party shall be entitled to accrued interest
from the indemnifying party (the "Payor Party") in respect of such Loss
accruing from the date that such Payee Party incurred such Loss at an interest
rate equal to the Specified Rate until the date such Payor Party actually makes
payment to such Payee Party in respect of such Loss.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                                  TAX MATTERS

         Section 8.1 Tax Indemnification.

         (a) MLIM Parent shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
BlackRock Indemnified Parties from and against (without duplication), (v) any
and all Taxes and Losses related to Taxes of or relating to the ownership,
operation or conduct of MLIM Business Entities or the Assets for any Tax year
or portion thereof ending on or prior to the MLIM Contribution, (w) any and all
United Kingdom Taxes and Losses related to United Kingdom Taxes (i) for which a
UK Company is secondarily liable as a result of having been a member of a group
for any Tax purpose prior to Closing or (ii) arising as a result of the
provision of non-cash benefits prior to Closing to employees, (x) any and all
Taxes and Losses relating to Taxes arising out of (i) any breach of or any
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty (without giving effect to any
qualifiers or exceptions relating to knowledge, materiality or MLIM Material
Adverse Effect) including the representations and warranties contained in
Exhibit 3.20 or (ii) any breach of a covenant relating to Taxes made by MLIM
Parent or any of its Affiliates, (y) any and all Taxes and Losses relating to
Taxes of or relating to the MLIM Transferors, the MLIM Business Entities or the
Assets that directly arise as a result of entering into this Agreement or
Closing other than Transfer Taxes for which BlackRock is liable pursuant to
Section 8.7, or (z) any failure on the part of MLIM Parent or any of its
Affiliates to comply with the DCL recapture provisions set forth in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1503-2(g)(2)(vii) with respect to the DCLs of the UK
Entities, provided that MLIM Parent shall have no liability under Section
8.1(a) in relation to any Taxes or Losses related to United Kingdom Taxes, in
either case of the UK Companies, to the extent that such Taxes or Losses (i)
were provided for in the Accounts of the UK Companies or were otherwise taken
into account in determining the consideration payable for the MLIM
Contribution, or (ii) arise as a result of post Closing changes in law
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any judicial decision), generally
published concession or practice of any Governmental Authority having
retrospective effect, or (iii) are penalties or interest which arise as a
result of any unreasonable delay or default by a BlackRock Party or UK Company
post Closing, or (iv) arise as a result of an act by a BlackRock Party or UK
Company post Closing which the UK Company was not legally bound, as at Closing,
to take, is outside the ordinary course of its business, was not requested in
writing by MLIM Parent and which the BlackRock Party or the UK Company knew or
ought reasonably to have known would give rise to such Taxes or Losses and
provided, further, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no payment shall be due with respect to any Taxes or Losses related
to Taxes relating to DCLs existing at or prior to the MLIM Contribution until
there has been a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code or any similar state, local or foreign Tax provision) with respect to the
relevant Taxes.

         (b) In the event of a breach of the covenant in section 5.10(f), the
amount of indemnification payable to the BlackRock Indemnified Parties shall
not exceed the amount equal to the product of (i) the Tax loss or deduction
recognized by MLIM Parent and its Affiliates as a result of any transaction or
series of transactions occurring after the date hereof and on or prior to the
MLIM Contribution resulting in a reduction in the aggregate adjusted tax basis
of the 197 Intangibles and (ii) 40%.

         (c) All amounts payable or to be paid under this Section 8.1 (the "Tax
Indemnity Payments") shall be paid in immediately available funds within five
(5) Business Days after the later of (i) receipt of a written request from the
party entitled to such Tax Indemnity Payment and (ii) the day of payment of the
amount that is the subject of the Tax Indemnity Payment by the party entitled
to receive the Tax Indemnity Payment. Any late payments shall accrue interest
at the Specified Rate. All indemnification payments pursuant to this Article
VIII shall be made on an After-Tax Basis. "After-Tax Basis" shall mean, for
purposes of this Agreement, the amount otherwise due under this Article VIII
increased by such additional amount as necessary so that the aggregate payment,
net of Tax liability to the party entitled to payment is equal to the amount
due under this Article VIII without taking into account Taxes incurred by the
party entitled to payment on the receipt of such payment. For purposes of
determining the Tax liability with respect to any indemnification payment
received under this Article VIII, the parties shall assume that the party
entitled to payment's combined effective Tax rate is 40%.

         (d) For purposes of Article VIII, any transaction that takes place
after the Closing, including transactions taking place after the Closing but on
the Closing Date, shall be considered to be made after the Closing Date.

         (e) New BlackRock shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the MLIM
Indemnified Parties from and against (without duplication), any and all Taxes
and Losses related to Taxes arising out of BlackRock's breach of the covenants
contained in Sections 5.10(d) and 5.10(e), provided however, that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no payment shall be
due with respect to this Section 8.1(e) until there has been a "determination"
(within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar state, local
or foreign Tax provision) with respect to the relevant Taxes.

         Section 8.2 Tax Indemnification Procedures.

         (a) If a notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, adjustment,
assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding,
suit, dispute or other claim (a "Tax Claim") shall be delivered or sent to or
commenced or initiated by any Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes for
which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification, the receiving party
shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the Tax Claim along with a
copy of the relevant Tax Claim notice; provided that the failure by either
party to promptly notify the other of any such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Parties from their obligations under this Article VIII except to
the extent that the Indemnified Parties are materially and adversely prejudiced
as a consequence of such failure.

         (b) With respect to any Tax Claim for which any Indemnifying Party
would be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Parties
may, upon written notice to the Indemnified Parties (such written notice to be
provided by the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after notice thereof has been
given to any of the Indemnifying Parties, and (ii) three (3) Business Days
prior to the date required to answer or respond to any such claim), assume and
control the defense of such Tax Claim at their own cost and expense and with
their own counsel and the Indemnified Parties and their Affiliates agree to
cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties in pursuing such contest. If the
Indemnifying Parties elect to assume the defense of any such Tax Claim, the
Indemnifying Parties shall (A) consult with the Indemnified Parties or their
Affiliate and shall not enter into any settlement with respect to any such Tax
Claim without the Indemnified Parties' prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or, if such settlement could
adversely affect the Indemnified Parties or any of their Affiliates, without
the consent of the Indemnified Parties; (B) keep the Indemnified Parties
informed of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim
(including promptly forwarding copies to the Indemnified Parties of any related
correspondence and providing the Indemnified Parties with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any related correspondence prior to being
sent by the Indemnifying Parties to any Governmental Authority); and (C) at its
own cost and expense, grant the Indemnified Parties (or their Affiliate) the
right to participate in (but not to control) the defense of such Tax Claim.

         (c) In connection with the contest of any Tax Claim that the
Indemnifying Parties have the ability to control but do not timely elect to
control pursuant to Section 8.2(b), such contest shall be controlled by the
Indemnified Parties, and the Indemnifying Parties agree to cooperate fully with
the Indemnified Parties and their Affiliates in pursuing such contest. In
connection with any such contest the Indemnified Parties shall (A) consult with
the Indemnifying Parties or their Affiliate and shall not enter into any
settlement with respect to any such Tax Claim without the Indemnifying Parties'
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; (B) keep the Indemnifying Parties informed of all material
developments and events relating to such Tax Claim (including promptly
forwarding copies to the Indemnifying Parties of any related correspondence and
providing the Indemnifying Parties with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any related correspondence prior to being sent by the Indemnified
Parties to any Governmental Authority); and (C) at the Indemnifying Parties'
own cost and expense, grant the Indemnifying Parties (or their Affiliate) the
right to participate in (but not to control) the defense of such Tax Claim.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting any party's right to
indemnification under this Article VIII.

         (d) If an Indemnifying Party makes a payment to an Indemnified Party
in respect of a Tax Claim, and the Indemnified Party is entitled to recover
from any person (other than an Affiliate) any sum in respect of the Tax Claim
(an "Unrelated Party"), the Indemnified Party shall (i) notify the Indemnifying
Party and keep them fully informed, (ii) co-operate fully to take all
reasonable steps to enforce recovery against the Unrelated Party, at the
written request and cost of the Indemnifying Party, and (iii) account to the
Indemnifying Party for any sums recovered from the Unrelated Party, net of Tax,
costs and expenses suffered.

         (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the procedure for indemnification claims with regard to Taxes shall
be governed exclusively by Article VIII.

         Section 8.3 Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. MLIM Parent hereby
agrees and covenants that any and all existing Tax allocation or sharing
agreements or arrangements, whether or not written, that may have been entered
into by MLIM Parent or its Affiliates (other than any MLIM Business Entity or
any Fund), on the one hand, and any MLIM Business Entity or any Fund, on the
other hand, shall be terminated on or before the Closing Date, and no payments
pursuant to such agreements or arrangements shall be made after such
termination. The BlackRock Parties hereby agree and covenant that any and all
existing Tax allocation or sharing agreements or arrangements, whether or not
written, that may have been entered into by any BlackRock Party or any
Subsidiary of any BlackRock Party, on the one hand, and any other person not a
BlackRock Party or any Subsidiary of any BlackRock Party, on the other hand,
shall be terminated on or before the Closing Date, and no payments pursuant to
such agreements or arrangements shall be made after such termination, provided
however that the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement among BlackRock, Inc., PNC Asset
Management, Inc. and PNC Bank Corp. shall not be terminated, as provided in
Section 5.2 of the Implementation and Stockholder Agreement.

         Section 8.4 Conflicts; Survival. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations of the parties hereto set
forth in this Article VIII shall (a) be unconditional and absolute and (b)
remain in full force and effect indefinitely. The representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.20 and Exhibit 3.20 shall survive the Closing
until six (6) months following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (taking into account all extensions thereof) and covenants relating
to Taxes shall survive indefinitely; provided that, in the event notice for
indemnification under Section 8.2 hereof shall have been given within the
applicable survival period, the representation or warranty that is the subject
of such indemnification claim shall survive until such time as such claim is
finally resolved. Indemnification for Taxes and Losses with respect to Taxes
shall be governed solely by Article VIII and in the event of a conflict between
this Article VIII and any other provision of this Agreement, this Article VIII
shall govern and control.

         Section 8.5 Tax Treatment. The parties hereto agree to treat any
payment made by MLIM Parent pursuant to Article VII or Article VIII as a
contribution to the capital of New BlackRock for all Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" pursuant to Section 1313(a) of
the Code or other applicable Law.

         Section 8.6 Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing, MLIM Parent
and New BlackRock shall (a) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to
assist) the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is
responsible for preparing and filing; (b) cooperate fully in preparing for any
audits of, or disputes with Governmental Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns
with respect to any of the MLIM Business Entities or any Fund; and (c) make
available to the other and to any Governmental Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of any of
the MLIM Business Entities or any Fund. MLIM Parent shall provide BlackRock
prior to the Closing, and New BlackRock after the Closing, with all reasonably
requested information, records and documents relating to the adjusted tax basis
of the MLIM Business Entities or any of the Assets, including any and all
adjustments to such adjusted tax basis arising as a result of any adjustment
made by a Governmental Authority, in connection with the recognition of gain or
recapture in connection with the MLIM Restructuring or the MLIM Contribution or
otherwise. Further, MLIM Parent shall provide BlackRock with reasonable notice
of its plans regarding the MLIM Restructuring.

         Section 8.7 Transfer Taxes. Other than in respect of VAT, BlackRock
and MLIM Parent shall each pay one half (1/2) of any Transfer Taxes. All
consideration given for the purchase of any Assets under this Agreement shall
be inclusive of VAT. No additional amounts shall be required to be paid or
otherwise provided in respect of any VAT arising on the sale of such Assets.

         The MLIM Parent and the BlackRock Parties intend that and shall use
all reasonable endeavours (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the making of
any election or application in respect of VAT to any Governmental Authority or
entering into a written agreement) to secure that the sale of any Assets of a
UK Company is treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services for
the purposes of the laws governing VAT in any relevant European Union member
state.

         Section 8.8 Tax Returns. MLIM Parent shall file or cause to be filed
when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to
any MLIM Business Entity or Asset that will be wholly-owned directly or
indirectly by New BlackRock immediately after the MLIM Contribution for taxable
years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date. With respect to any Tax
Return with respect to any MLIM Business Entity or Asset that will be
wholly-owned directly or indirectly by New BlackRock immediately after the MLIM
Contribution that covers a taxable year or period beginning before and ending
after the Closing Date, MLIM Parent shall provide a copy of such Tax Return to
New BlackRock at least 30 days prior to the due date (including applicable
extensions) for the filing thereof, and New BlackRock shall have the right to
approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) such Tax Return to
the extent that it relates to the portion of the taxable year beginning the day
after the Closing Date. No BlackRock Party (or any Subsidiary of any BlackRock
Party) will file any amended Tax Return, unless otherwise required by Law or
with the consent of MLIM Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, with respect
to any Tax Return for any taxable year or period ending on or before the
Closing Date, or with respect to any Tax Return for any taxable year or period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date.

         Section 8.9 Tax Apportionment. For purposes of this Agreement, to
apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, MLIM Parent
may, to the extent permitted under Law, elect with the relevant Governmental
Authority to treat for all Tax purposes the Closing Date as the last day of the
taxable year or period of a MLIM Business Entity transferred to New BlackRock
pursuant to the MLIM Contribution. In any case where the Closing Date is not
the last day of the taxable year or period, the portion of any Taxes that are
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be:

         (a) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis (such as
real property taxes), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
relevant Straddle Period; and

         (b) in the case of Taxes not described in (a) (such as Taxes that are
either (A) based upon or related to income or receipts, (B) imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible) or (C) payroll and similar taxes), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year or period ended
on the Closing Date; provided that, in determining such amount, exemptions,
allowances, or deductions that are calculated on a periodic basis, such as the
deduction for depreciation, shall be taken into account on a pro-rated basis in
the manner described in (a) above.

         Section 8.10 Purchase Price Allocation.

         (a) MLIM Parent, BlackRock and New BlackRock agree to allocate the
MLIM Consideration among the MLIM Transferors for all Tax purposes. None of
MLIM Parent, New BlackRock or BlackRock (nor any of their respective
Affiliates) shall file any Tax Return or take a position with a Governmental
Authority that is inconsistent with the allocation as determined below (the
"Allocation"), including any amendments, except as provided in "determination"
(within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar state, local
or foreign Tax provision).

         (b) MLIM Parent shall present a draft of the allocation (the "Proposed
Allocation") to BlackRock for review within 60 days after the date hereof.
Except as provided in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) below, at the close of
business on the Closing Date, the Proposed Allocation shall become binding upon
New BlackRock and MLIM Parent and shall be the Allocation.

             (i) BlackRock shall raise any objection to the Proposed Allocation
     in writing within 30 days of the delivery of the Proposed Allocation.
     BlackRock and MLIM Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
     differences for 30 days after delivery of any objection by BlackRock. If
     BlackRock and MLIM Parent reach written agreement amending the Proposed
     Allocation, the Proposed Allocation, as amended by such written agreement,
     shall become binding upon BlackRock and MLIM Parent and their Affiliates
     and shall be the Allocation.

             (ii) If BlackRock and MLIM Parent cannot mutually agree on the
     appropriate allocation within the 30-day time limit set forth in
     subparagraph (i) above, BlackRock and MLIM Parent shall submit all
     remaining disputes to an independent valuation expert (the "Valuation
     Expert") agreed to by BlackRock and MLIM Parent for resolution. BlackRock
     and MLIM Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Valuation Expert
     to resolve such disputes within 20 days of its appointment, and the
     Valuation Expert's determination with respect to any such disputed item
     shall be final and binding. The fees and expenses of the Valuation Expert
     incurred under this section (ii) and shall be paid 50% by BlackRock and
     50% by MLIM Parent.

         (c) In the event that there is any adjustment to the MLIM
Consideration , MLIM Parent shall revise the Allocation to reflect any such
adjustment using the same methodology as used in the initial Allocation and
shall promptly present a draft of such revised Allocation to BlackRock for
review; provided that the principles contained in paragraphs (b)(i) and (ii)
above (including the right of BlackRock to raise any objection to the proposed
revised Allocation and to have such objection resolved by the Valuation Expert)
shall apply to such revised Allocation.

         Section 8.11 UK VAT.

         (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, MLIM Parent shall procure that (if one has not already been made) an
application shall be made to H.M. Revenue & Customs in the UK pursuant to
Section 43B of the VATA 1994 for the exclusion of each MLIM Business Entity
from the bodies treated as members of the same VAT group as MLIM Parent or any
retained Affiliate of MLIM Parent for the purposes of Section 43 VATA 1996 (the
"MLIM VAT Group") and for such exclusion to take effect on Closing or, if H.M.
Revenue & Customs do not permit this, at the earliest date following Closing
permitted by Section 43B.

         (b) Pending the taking effect of such application and for so long
thereafter as may be necessary, MLIM Parent and each BlackRock Party shall
procure that such information is provided to the other as may be required to
enable the continuing representative member of the MLIM VAT Group to make all
the returns required of it in respect of the MLIM VAT Group.

         (c) When the exclusion takes effect after Closing, MLIM Parent and
each BlackRock Party shall procure that such payments shall be made between
such representative member and the MLIM Business Entities as may be appropriate
to ensure that the resulting position of each of the companies concerned is as
close as possible to the position which would have been obtained if such
application or applications had taken effect on Closing.

                                  ARTICLE IX

                              TERMINATION/SURVIVAL

follows:

             (i) by written consent of MLIM Parent and BlackRock;

             (ii) by MLIM Parent if (A) a condition to the obligation of MLIM
     Parent to close set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 cannot be satisfied at or
     prior to the date set forth in Section 9.1(a)(iv) below or (B) there has
     been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
     agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of BlackRock and such
     breach has not been cured within 60 Business Days (or, in the case of a
     BlackRock Material Adverse Effect, 30 Business Days) after written notice
     to BlackRock (provided that no cure period shall be required for a breach
     that by its nature cannot be cured) such that the conditions set forth in
     Section 6.1 or 6.3 cannot be satisfied at or prior to the date set forth
     in Section 9.1(a)(iv) below; provided that the right to terminate this
     Agreement under this Section 9.1(a)(ii) shall not be available to MLIM
     Parent if (x) the nonfulfillment of the conditions to the obligation of
     MLIM Parent to close set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 results from the
     breach by MLIM Parent of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
     or agreements contained in this Agreement or (y) the violation or breach
     by BlackRock referred to in clause (B) of this Section 9.1(a)(ii) results
     solely from the breach by MLIM Parent of any of its representations,
     warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

     has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
     agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of MLIM Parent and such
     breach has not been cured within 60 Business Days (or, in the case of the
     occurrence of a MLIM Material Adverse Effect, 30 Business Days) after

     conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2 cannot be satisfied at or prior
     to the date set forth in Section 9.1(a)(iv) below; provided that the right
     to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(a)(iii) shall not be
     available to BlackRock if (x) the nonfulfillment of the conditions to the
     obligation of BlackRock to close set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2 results
     from the breach by BlackRock of any of its representations, warranties,
     covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or (y) the violation
     or breach by MLIM Parent referred to in clause (B) of this Section
     9.1(a)(iii) results solely from the breach by BlackRock of any of its
     representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
     Agreement;

             (iv) by MLIM Parent or BlackRock if the Closing has not occurred
     on or before January 31, 2007; provided that the right to terminate this
     Agreement under this Section 9.1(a)(iv) shall not be available to any
     party whose failure to perform any covenant or obligation hereunder or
     other breach has caused or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur
     on or before such date; or

             (v) by MLIM Parent if the Board of Directors of BlackRock,
     pursuant to the exercise of its fiduciary obligations, (A) shall have
     determined not to hold the BlackRock Stockholders Meeting, or (B) shall
     have changed its recommendation to BlackRock's stockholders regarding
     approval of the issuance of the MLIM Consideration and the Merger.

         (b) The termination of this Agreement shall be effectuated by the
delivery by the party terminating this Agreement to each other party of at
least two (2) Business Days' prior written notice of such termination. If this
Agreement so terminates, it shall become null and void and have no further
force or effect, except as provided in Section 9.2.

         Section 9.2 Survival After Termination. If this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 9.1 hereof and the Transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated, this Agreement shall become void and
of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of Section 5.6,
Section 5.9 and this Section 9.2 and Article X. None of the parties hereto
shall have any liability in the event of a termination of this Agreement,
except to the extent that such termination results from the willful violation
by such party of its obligations under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE X

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 10.1 Amendments; Extension; Waiver. This Agreement may not be
amended, altered or modified except by written instrument executed by each of
the parties. The failure by any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any
such provision nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any
part hereof or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every
such provision. No waiver of any breach of or non-compliance with this
Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or
non-compliance. Any waiver made by any party hereto in connection with this
Agreement shall not be valid unless agreed to in writing by such party.

         Section 10.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the
Schedules, Exhibits, certificates and lists referred to herein, and any
documents executed by the parties simultaneously herewith or pursuant thereto,
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the
entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         Section 10.3 Construction and Interpretation. When a reference is made
in this Agreement to Sections, Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference
shall be to a Section of or Annex, Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The term "knowledge" of MLIM
Parent shall be deemed to mean the actual knowledge of any of the individuals
set forth in Exhibit 10.3-A or actual knowledge that would have been obtained
by any of such individuals after due inquiry of those persons that such
individuals would reasonably expect to have knowledge of the relevant subject

                                NEW BOISE, INC.


                        (Pursuant to Section 151 of the
                       Delaware General Corporation Law)

          New Boise, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), hereby
certifies that the following resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation:

          RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority expressly granted to and
vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors")
by the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
the Corporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), there is hereby created,
out of the 500,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Corporation authorized in Article Fourth of the Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Preferred Stock"), a series of the Preferred Stock
consisting of [ ] shares, which series shall have the following powers,
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other

optional or other rights, and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions,
set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation which are applicable to the
Preferred Stock):

Section 1.     Designation of Amount.

          The shares of Preferred Stock created hereby shall be designated the
"Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock" (the "Series A Preferred
Stock") and the authorized number of shares constituting such series shall be
[ ].

Section 2.     Dividends, Etc.

          (a) In the event any dividends are declared or paid or any other
distribution is made on or with respect to the Common Stock of the Corporation,
the holder of each share of Series A Preferred Stock as of the record date
established by the Board of Directors for such dividend or distribution on the
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends in an amount equal to the
amount of the dividends or distribution that such holder would have received
had the holder held one share of Common Stock as of the date immediately prior
to the record date for such dividend or distribution on the Common Stock, such
dividends to be payable on the same payment date established by the Board of
Directors for the payment of such dividend or distribution on the Common Stock;
provided, however, that such dividend shall be payable, at the option of the
holder of each share of Series A Preferred Stock, (i) in a number of shares of
Common Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of payment of such dividend
equal to the aggregate amount of such cash dividends otherwise payable to such
holder on such date, with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of
Common Stock or (ii) in an amount of cash equal to the Fair Market Value of
such shares of Common Stock or (iii) in any combination of the foregoing;
provided, further, that if the election by any holder of Series A Preferred
Stock to receive Common Stock in respect of any dividend or distribution would
result in such holder and its Affiliates Beneficially Owning in excess of 49.8
percent of the Total Voting Power, then such holder shall receive cash to the
extent of such excess. The record date for any such dividend shall be the
record date for the applicable dividend or distribution on the Common Stock,
and any such dividends shall be payable to the Persons in whose name the Series
A Preferred Stock is registered at the close of business on the applicable
record date.

          (b) No dividend shall be paid or declared on any share of Common
Stock, unless a dividend, payable in the same consideration and manner, is
simultaneously paid or declared, as the case may be, on each share of Series A
Preferred Stock in an amount determined as set forth above. For purposes
hereof, the term "dividends" shall include any pro rata distribution by the
Corporation of cash, property, securities (including, but not limited to,
rights, warrants or options) or other property or assets to the holders of the
Common Stock, whether or not paid out of capital, surplus or earnings, other
than a distribution upon liquidation of the Corporation in accordance with
Section 3 hereof.

          (c) No subdivision, combination, consolidation or reclassification
shall be effected with respect to the Common Stock unless a proportionate
subdivision, combination, consolidation or reclassification, effected in the
same manner, is simultaneously effected with respect to each share of Series A
Preferred Stock, and no subdivision, combination, consolidation or
reclassification shall be effected with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock
unless a proportionate subdivision, combination, consolidation or
reclassification, effected in the same manner, is simultaneously effected with
respect to each share of Common Stock.

          (d) Prior to declaring any dividend or making any distribution on or
with respect to shares of Common Stock, the Corporation shall take all prior
corporate action necessary to authorize the issuance of any securities payable
as a dividend in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock.

Section 3.     Liquidation Preference.

          (a) In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (a "Liquidation"), the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to receive out
of the available assets of the Corporation, whether such assets are stated
capital or surplus of any nature, an amount on such date equal to $0.01 per
share of Series A Preferred Stock, plus the amount of any declared but unpaid
dividends thereon as of such date, calculated pursuant to Section 2 (the
"Liquidation Preference"). Such payment shall be made before any payment shall
be made or any assets distributed to the holders of any class or series of the
Common Stock or any other class or series of the Corporation's capital stock
ranking junior as to liquidation rights to the Series A Preferred Stock.

          (b) After the payment of the Liquidation Preference, the remaining
assets of the Corporation shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of
Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, and the holders of Common Stock and
Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive the same amount per share
in respect thereof.

          (c) Neither the consolidation nor merger of the Corporation into or
with any other entity, nor the sale or transfer by the Corporation of all or
any part of its assets, nor the reduction of the capital stock of the
Corporation, shall be deemed to be a Liquidation; provided, however, that in
any such transaction, to the extent that holders of Common Stock receive
consideration other than voting securities, the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock shall receive identical consideration per share, and to the extent that
holder of Common Stock receive voting securities, the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock shall receive non-voting securities that are otherwise
identical to the securities received by holders of Common Stock; provided,
further that if the aggregate consideration to be received by the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock in any such transaction would be less than what
such holders would have received had such transaction been deemed to be a
Liquidation, then such transaction shall be deemed to be a Liquidation within
the meaning of this Section 3(a).

          (d) Any securities to be delivered to the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3 as a consequence of a Liquidation
shall be valued at their Fair Market Value.

          Section 4. Voting Rights. Except as otherwise provided by applicable
law, the holders of outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall
have no voting rights.

          Section 5. Restrictions on Common Stock. The Corporation shall not at
any time effect a subdivision, combination, consolidation or reclassification
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of
shares of Common Stock, unless such subdivision, combination, consolidation or
reclassification shall also apply in a like manner to the outstanding Series A
Preferred Stock.

          Section 6. Automatic Conversion . Each share of Series A Preferred
Stock shall be automatically converted into one fully paid and non-assessable
share of Common Stock upon the Transfer thereof by an initial holder thereof
(an "Initial Holder") or any Affiliate of the Initial Holder other than to an
Initial Holder or an Affiliate of an Initial Holder (except a broker-dealer
affiliate in connection with a capital markets transaction). Effective
immediately upon the occurrence of the conversion, certificates theretofore
evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed to evidence that
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such shares of
Series A Preferred Stock. The Initial Holder shall give prompt notice to the
Corporation of (i) any transfer of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and
shall indicate in such notice if the transferee is an Affiliate of the Initial
Holder and (ii) any event or transaction pursuant to which any such transferee
Affiliate then holding Series A Preferred Stock ceases to be an Affiliate of
