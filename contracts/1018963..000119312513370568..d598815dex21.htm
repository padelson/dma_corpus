the Effective Time (the " _Estimated Closing Cash Amount_ "). For purposes of
the calculation of Net Working Capital of the Tungsten Materials Business, all
of the Transferred Assets and the Shares shall be deemed to have been conveyed
as of the Effective Time (regardless of any delayed transfer pursuant to
Section 5.17) and shall be included, to the extent applicable, in the
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital. For illustrative purposes only,
Annex C sets forth an example of the methodology by which the Preliminary
Purchase Price is to be determined.

 



7 (b) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to TDY the following
(collectively, the " _Preliminary Adjustment Statement_ "):

(A) a statement setting forth (x) a reasonably detailed calculation by Buyer
of the Net Working Capital of the Tungsten Materials Business, prepared by
Buyer in accordance with the Closing Net Working Capital Principles and on a
basis consistent with the Preliminary Closing Net Working Capital Statement,
and (y) the amount of any Cash Equivalents held by any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (together, the " _Closing Adjustment
Amounts_ "); and

 

(B) a certificate of an executive officer of Buyer certifying that the
Preliminary Closing Net Working Capital Statement has been prepared in
accordance with the Closing Net Working Capital Principles.

(ii) If TDY disagrees with Buyers calculation of the Closing Adjustment
Amounts, TDY shall promptly, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days
after receiving the Preliminary Adjustment Statement (the " _Review Period_
"), deliver to Buyer written notice describing its dispute by specifying
those items or amounts as to which TDY disagrees, together with TDYs
determination of such disputed items and amounts (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). If
TDY either gives notice that it agrees with Buyers calculation of the
Closing Adjustment Amounts or fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within the
Review Period, Buyer and TDY agree that the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
shall be deemed to set forth the Closing Adjustment Amounts with respect to
those items that have been agreed upon or for which TDY shall have failed to
deliver a Dispute Notice (and shall constitute the Final Net Working Capital
and Final Closing Cash Amount). If TDY delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer
within the Review Period, TDY and Buyer will use good faith efforts to
resolve the dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date TDY
delivers the Dispute Notice to Buyer (and all such discussions related thereto
shall be governed by Rule 408 of the United States Federal Rules of Evidence,
and any applicable similar state rule and evidence of such discussions shall
not be admissible in any future proceedings between the parties). If Buyer and
TDY are not able to resolve all disputed items within such 30-day period,
then either party shall have the right to submit the items in dispute
following the expiration of such 30-day period to KPMG LLP, or if KPMG LLP is
unwilling to serve, to another mutually acceptable internationally recognized
independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm
shall be given reasonable access to all relevant records of the Tungsten
Materials Business to calculate the Closing Adjustment Amounts. If
any remaining issues in dispute are submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution, each of Buyer and TDY will be afforded an opportunity to present
to the Accounting Firm any material relating to the determination of the
matters in dispute and to discuss such matters with the Accounting Firm (with
any such materials to be submitted to the Accounting Firm within ten days
following the expiration of the 30-day period referenced above). The
Accounting Firm shall calculate, based solely on the 

 



8  written submissions of Buyer, on the one hand, and TDY, on the other hand,
and not by independent investigation, the Closing Adjustment Amounts and shall
be instructed that its calculation (A) must be made in accordance with the
standards and definitions in this Agreement (including the Closing Net Working
Capital Principles) and Exhibit B, and (B) with respect to each item in
dispute, must be within the range of values established for such amount as
determined by reference to the value assigned to such amount by TDY in the
Dispute Notice and by Buyer in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. The
Accounting Firm shall submit such calculation to TDY and Buyer as soon as
practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the remaining
issues in dispute are submitted to the Accounting Firm. The determination by
the Accounting Firm of the Closing Adjustment Amounts, as set forth in a
written notice delivered to Buyer and TDY by the Accounting Firm in
accordance with this Agreement, will, in the absence of fraud or manifest
error, be binding and conclusive on Buyer and TDY. In making its
determination, the Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm
shall be limited to the determination of whether the Closing Adjustment
Amounts were properly calculated in accordance with the Closing Net Working
Capital Principles, and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other
determination or interpretations with respect to the Agreement. The Closing
Adjustment Amounts as determined after all disputes have been resolved in
accordance with this Section 2.3(b)(ii) are referred to herein as the "
_Final Net Working Capital_ " with respect to the final determination of the
Net Working Capital and as the " _Final Closing Cash Amount_ " with respect to
the final determination of the amount of any Cash Equivalents held by the
Transferred Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time.

(iii) Buyer and TDY shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm.

(iv) In connection with TDYs review of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement,
Buyer shall (i) provide reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice, to its employees and all work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents prepared or reviewed by Buyer or any of its
employees and accountants or other representatives during the course of its
review which are relevant to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement (which
access shall be provided promptly after request by TDY and/or
its representatives) and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Buyers independent accountant to communicate and cooperate with TDY and its
representatives with respect to such review.

 

(v) The process set forth in this Section 2.3(b) shall be the exclusive remedy
of TDY and Buyer for any disputes related to the Closing Adjustment Amount,
whether or not the underlying facts and circumstances constitute a breach of
any representations or warranties contained in this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this provision shall not prevent either party from seeking
indemnification in accordance with Section 8.4 of this Agreement for Losses

 



9  arising from or in connection with a breach of any representation or
warranty not related to the subject matter of this Section 2.3 and the
calculations made pursuant hereto.

 

(c) _Final Purchase Price Determination_.

 

(i) The Final Purchase Price shall be equal to the Preliminary Purchase Price,
(w) _plus_ , if the Final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant to
Section 2.3(b)(ii) exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, the amount of
such excess, (x) _minus_ , if the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the
Final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(ii), the
amount of such excess, (y) _plus_ , if the Final Closing Cash Amount as
determined pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(ii) exceeds the Estimated Closing Cash
Amount, the amount of such excess, (z) _minus_ , if the Estimated Closing
Cash Amount exceeds the Final Closing Cash Amount as determined pursuant to
Section 2.3(b)(ii), the amount of such excess (the difference between the
Preliminary Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price, the " _Final Closing
Adjustment_ ").

(ii) Buyer or TDY, as the case may be, shall, within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Net Working Capital and Final Closing
Cash Amount pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(ii), make payment to the other by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
the other of the amount of the Final Closing Adjustment as determined pursuant
to Section 2.3(c)(i), together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the
prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the Closing
Date, for the period from the Closing Date through and including the date of
payment.

Section 2.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within sixty (60) calendar days
of the Closing, Buyer shall provide to TDY a schedule which will provide for
the allocation of the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities
among the Shares, the Transferred Assets and the Tungsten Materials IP
assigned pursuant to the IP Assignment Agreements, in a manner consistent with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). The Purchase Price Allocation shall
attribute such allocated amounts to TDY and the Share Sellers based on their
ownership of the Shares, the Transferred Assets and the Tungsten Materials IP
assigned pursuant to the IP Assignment Agreement on the date of this
Agreement, which ownership allocation is set forth on Section 2.4 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule. The Purchase Price Allocation shall be subject
to the review and consent of TDY. If TDY does not object to the Purchase
Price Allocation by written notice to Buyer within thirty (30) Business Days
after receipt, then the Purchase Price Allocation shall be deemed to have been
accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for all purposes of this
Agreement. If TDY objects to the Purchase Price Allocation, it shall notify
Buyer in writing of its objection within thirty (30) Business Days after
receipt by Buyer of the Purchase Price Allocation and shall set forth in such
written notice the disputed item or items and the basis for its objection,
and TDY and Buyer shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute for a
period of fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter. If, within fifteen (15)
Business Days of TDYs delivery of a valid written notice of objection to the
Purchase Price Allocation, Buyer and TDY have not reached an agreement
regarding the disputed item or items specified in such written notice, the

 



10  dispute shall be presented to the Accounting Firm, whose determination shall
be binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in
connection with the resolution of any dispute under this Section 2.4 shall be
paid fifty percent (50%) by TDY and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. If
necessary, Buyer shall make appropriate adjustments to the Purchase Price
Allocation to reflect the difference, if any, between the Preliminary
Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price as determined pursuant to Section
2.3. The parties shall (i) timely file all Tax Returns (including United
States Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and any supplemental filings to
reflect any revisions to the Purchase Price Allocation) required to be filed
in connection with the Purchase Price Allocation, and (ii) prepare and file
all Tax Returns and determine all Taxes in a manner consistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation. Each of the parties shall notify the other if it
receives notice that any Tax Authority proposes any allocation different from
that set forth on the Purchase Price Allocation. No party shall take any
position (whether in audits, tax returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent
with the Purchase Price Allocation (as adjusted as a consequence of any
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.3) unless required to
do so under GAAP or applicable Law.

Section _3.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement, Etc_. Each of TDY and the
Share Sellers has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to

accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.

 

Section _3.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Neither the execution,

12  Sellers, will (a) violate any provision of the Organizational Documents of
TDY, ATI, the Share Sellers or the Transferred Subsidiaries, (b) require any
consent, waiver, approval, license, authorization or permit of, or filing
with or notification to (collectively, the " _Governmental Filings_ "), any
Governmental Authority except for (i) filings with the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and with the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") pursuant to the HSR Act,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) requirements of any
foreign Regulatory Laws and Laws regulating trade or exchange or currency
controls; and (iii) such other material consents, waivers, approvals,
licenses, authorizations, permits, filings or notifications set forth in
Section 3.3(b)(iii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, (c) conflict with,
or result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice
or lapse of time or both) a default under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation of TDY (in
respect of the Tungsten Materials Business) or any Transferred Subsidiary
under or a loss of any material benefit to which TDY (in respect of the
Tungsten Materials Business) or any Transferred Subsidiary is entitled under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Lease or any Material
Contract, except such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations and accelerations which (i) would not reasonably be expected to
result in the termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material
obligation of TDY (in respect of the Tungsten Materials Business) or any
Transferred Subsidiary of or under any Lease or Material Contract or the
creation of any Encumbrance (except for Permitted Encumbrances) upon any of
the Transferred Assets or the Shares, or (ii) are set forth in Section
3.3(c)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, or (d) assuming the making of
the Governmental Filings and obtaining of the related approvals referred to
in clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii) above, violate in any material respect any Law

Transferred Subsidiary or by which any of its respective properties or Assets
may be bound.

Section 3.4 _Financial Matters_. Section 3.4 of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule contains copies of the unaudited balance sheets of the Tungsten
Materials Business as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 and the
related unaudited statements of income for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2011 and December 31, 2012 and an unaudited interim balance sheet of the
Tungsten Materials Business as of June 30, 2013 and the unaudited statement of
income for the six month period ended June 30, 2013 (collectively, the "
_Scheduled Financial Matters_ "). Except as set forth in Section 3.4 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule, the Scheduled Financial Matters have been

in such Scheduled Financial Matters), subject, with respect to the interim
financial statements included in the Scheduled Financial Matters, to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments and the absence of disclosures normally
made in footnotes to audited financial statements. All of the Scheduled
Financial Matters are qualified by the fact that the Tungsten Materials
Business has not operated as a separate "stand alone" entity within ATI. As a
result, the Tungsten Materials Business received certain allocated charges
and credits as discussed more fully in the notes accompanying the Scheduled
Financial Matters. Such charges and credits do not necessarily reflect the
amounts which would have resulted from arms-length transactions or which the
Tungsten Materials Business would incur on a stand-alone basis.

 



13 Section 3.5 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement and except for actions taken in connection with the separation
of the Tungsten Materials Business from ATI and its Subsidiaries other assets

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) TDY and the
Transferred Subsidiaries have operated the Tungsten Materials Business in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in all material

other similar authorizations necessary for the conduct of the Tungsten
Materials Business as presently conducted (the " _Permits_ ") and, except as
set forth in Section 3.6 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, is in material
compliance with the terms of the Permits. No Transferred Subsidiary is bound
by any material undertaking or commitment given by it to, or any order,
judgment or direction made by, any Governmental Authority in connection with
any anti-trust related matter. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 3.6, no representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this
Section 3.6 in respect of any matter the subject matter of which is
specifically covered by Section 3.9, Section 3.10, Section 3.12 or Section
3.13.

 

Section 3.7 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as disclosed, set forth or
reflected or reserved against on the Scheduled Financial Matters, (b) for
Liabilities incurred or permitted to be incurred pursuant to this Agreement,

(relating to or involving the Tungsten Materials Business) or any Transferred
Subsidiary and (b) during the two (2) year period prior to the date of this
Agreement, there has not been any material Action pending, or, to the
Knowledge of TDY, threatened in writing against TDY (relating to or involving
the Tungsten Materials Business) or any Transferred Subsidiary before any
Governmental Authority or arbitration tribunal. Except as set forth in Section
3.8 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this
Agreement, neither TDY (in respect of the Tungsten Materials Business) nor
any Transferred Subsidiary is, or during the two (2) year period prior to the
date of this Agreement has been, subject to any material outstanding
injunction, writ, judgment, order or decree of any Governmental Authority or
arbitration tribunal.

Subsidiaries in respect of any material Tax.

 

(f) No deficiency for a material Tax has been asserted in writing or

resolved and paid in full or (ii) are being contested in good faith.

 

(g) Each Transferred Subsidiary has maintained all material records in
relation to Tax for such period that is required by Law and has sufficient

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Benefit Plan_ " shall mean each
material deferred compensation, incentive compensation, equity compensation,
bonus or severance plan, fund or program; each material "welfare" plan, fund

Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")); each material
"pension" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of section 3(2) of ERISA);
each material employment, change-in-control, termination or severance
agreement; and each other material employee benefit plan, fund, program,
agreement or arrangement, in each case, that is sponsored, maintained or
contributed to or required to be contributed to by TDY, any Transferred
Subsidiary or ATI or by any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated, that together with TDY or ATI would be deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of section 4001(b) of ERISA (an " _ERISA
Affiliate_ "), or to which any of TDY, any Transferred Subsidiary or ATI or
their Subsidiaries or an ERISA Affiliate is party, whether written or oral,
for the benefit of any person primarily employed (or, in the case of the
Transferred Subsidiaries, previously primarily employed) in the Tungsten
Materials Business as of the date hereof. "Controlled Group Plan" means any
Benefit Plan, within the meaning of the preceding sentence but without regard
to the last clause thereof, for the benefit of any person employed by TDY, ATI
or any ERISA Affiliate.

 

(b) With respect to each written Benefit Plan, TDY has made available to Buyer
in the Data Room true and complete copies of the Benefit Plan or a summary

Plan intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code; and, with respect to
each unwritten Benefit Plan, TDY has made available to Buyer in the Data Room
an accurate written description of its material terms.

 

(c) No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by
ATI or its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in

Subsidiaries of incurring any such liability (other than for the payment of
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, all of which have been
timely paid).

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(d) of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, no Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA is

(e) Each Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including ERISA and

from the IRS and to the Knowledge of TDY no events have occurred that could
reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such qualification.

Section 3(1) of ERISA provides benefits (whether or not insured) for Business
Employees for periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination

(h) Except to the extent required by applicable Law and as set forth in
Section 3.10(h) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any Business Employee to severance
pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment or (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount, of compensation due any
Business Employee.

 

(i) As of the date of this Agreement there are (i) no pending or, to the
Knowledge of TDY threatened, claims, or facts that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to claims, by or on behalf of any Controlled Group Plan,
by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Controlled Group Plan in
their capacity as such, or otherwise involving any Controlled Group Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits) which would reasonably be expected to
result in material Liability to Buyer or any Transferred Subsidiary if
adversely determined and (ii) no matters pending (other than routine
qualification determination filings) with respect to any of the any
Controlled Group Plans before any Governmental Authority which would
reasonably be expected to result in material Liability to Buyer or any
Transferred Subsidiary if adversely determined.

 

(j) Section 3.10(a) to Section 3.10(i) do not apply in relation to employees
or pension arrangements of any Transferred Subsidiary outside of the United
States. With respect to any Benefit Plan that is established or maintained

usable and saleable condition, and is carried on the books and records of TDY

reserves for obsolete, damaged, defective, slow-moving or excess inventory
that are necessary and adequate to reduce the net recorded amount for such
items to net realizable value and as set forth on the Scheduled Financial
Matters but excluding any reserves recorded under the LIFO inventory
accounting method. For purposes of this Agreement, "net realizable value" is

be subject to any liability or other obligation to Buyer, its Affiliates,
agents or representatives or any Person resulting from the sale of the
Tungsten Materials Assets and the Shares to Buyer or Buyers use of, or the
use by any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any such information,
including information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material
made available to Buyer, its Affiliates or Representatives in the Data Room or
any teaser, the confidential information memorandum or management
presentations in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, unless any such information is expressly and specifically included

uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections and other forecasts
and plans so furnished to it, and that Buyer and its Affiliates
and Representatives shall have no claim (except with respect to claims based
on fraud or intentional misrepresentation) against any Person with respect
thereto. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that, without limiting the generality
of Section 3.23, neither TDY nor ATI, nor any of their respective
Representatives or Affiliates, have made any representation or warranty with
respect to such projections and other forecasts and plans.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, it is the explicit
intent of the parties hereto that neither TDY nor any of its Affiliates
(including ATI) are making any representation or warranty whatsoever, express
or implied, beyond those expressly provided by TDY in ARTICLE III of this
Agreement, including any implied warranty or representation as to suitability
or fitness for a particular purpose.

cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Regulatory
Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable, including (a) the obtaining of all

5.3(a):

(i) TDY and Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than (x) fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, file the
notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act and (y) twenty (20)
Business Days after the date hereof, effect all other
necessary notifications, or registrations pursuant to any applicable

case as required for the transactions contemplated hereby;

 

(ii) TDY and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each
other in (A) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or

Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all
such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals;

 



31 (iii) TDY and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of

Agreement and, to the extent permitted by Law, promptly furnish the other with
copies of notices or other communications (or, in the case of material oral
communications, advise the other of such communications (orally or
otherwise)) between TDY or Buyer and their Representatives, as the case may
be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and any Governmental Authority
with respect to such transactions. TDY and Buyer shall keep each other timely

possible, to consult with the other party in advance of, and, to the extent
not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, to give the other party the
opportunity to attend and to participate in any meeting, telephone conference
or other oral communication with any Governmental Authority relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither party shall consent
to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to
any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or withdraw its notification and report form pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other filing made pursuant to any Regulatory Law unless the
other party has given its prior written consent to such extension or delay;

 

(iv) Buyer shall, at Buyers sole cost, take, or cause to be taken, any and
all actions and do, or cause to be done, any and all things necessary, proper
or advisable to avoid, eliminate and resolve each and every impediment and
obtain all Required Antitrust Approvals in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
(but in any event at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date).
The actions required by the preceding sentence will be limited as follows:
Buyer shall not be required to, and shall not be required to cause
its Affiliates to, (A) sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate and
agree to sell or otherwise dispose of any assets or businesses now owned or
presently sought to be acquired pursuant to the transaction contemplated
hereby by Buyer or its Affiliates consisting of assets valued in excess of
$60,000,000, individually or in the aggregate; (B) terminate any existing
relationship, contractual right or obligation related to any assets or
businesses now owned or presently sought to be acquired pursuant to the
transaction contemplated hereby by Buyer or its Affiliates with a value in
excess of $60,000,000 over the life of such relationship, contractual right or
obligation, individually or in the aggregate; or (C) enter into agreements,
including with the

 



32  relevant Governmental Authority, giving effect to the foregoing clauses (A)
or (B). Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, keep TDY fully
informed of all matters, discussions and activities relating to any of the
matters described in or contemplated by clauses (A) through (C) of this
Section 5.3(b)(iv); and

 

(v) without limiting Section 5.3(b)(iv), each of TDY and Buyer (and each shall
cause its Affiliates to), in the event that any permanent or preliminary
injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the acquisition of
the Tungsten Materials Assets or the other transactions contemplated hereby
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent
or delay consummation of the acquisition of the Tungsten Materials Assets or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall use
its reasonable best efforts necessary to avoid, vacate, modify or suspend
such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as
close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement unless, by mutual
agreement, TDY and Buyer decide that action is not in their respective best
interests.

(c) In the event that (i) any Non-Material Antitrust Approval of any
Governmental Authority is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii)
there exists, at such time as the conditions to the Closing shall have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that are satisfied by action
taken at the Closing, provided that such conditions would be so satisfied),
any Regulatory Law (except with respect to the Required Antitrust Approvals)
that makes illegal or enjoins or prevents in any respect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each of clauses (i) and
(ii), a " _Delayed Antitrust Approval_ "), then TDY and Buyer shall effect the
Closing (including payment of the entire Preliminary Purchase Price), subject
to the terms of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, Section
7.1(b)), with respect to the Tungsten Materials Assets and Assumed Liabilities
outside of the jurisdiction of any such Governmental Authority or such
Regulatory Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of the parties
hereto set forth in this Section 5.3(c) shall continue with respect to each
such Delayed Antitrust Approval until such Delayed Antitrust Approval is
obtained, and upon receipt of such Delayed Antitrust Approval, the parties
hereto shall effect the transfer of the affected Tungsten Materials Assets and
Assumed Liabilities in accordance with this Agreement. Each such transfer,
upon occurrence, shall be retroactive to and be deemed to have occurred on
the Closing Date. Furthermore, as of the Closing Date, TDY and Buyer shall,
subject to applicable Law, enter into mutually agreeable alternative business
arrangements consistent with the terms of this Agreement or
other arrangements which provide Buyer with the net economic benefit or loss
(after taking into account any adverse Tax consequences to TDY or ATI) of, and
liability for, the affected Tungsten Materials Assets and Assumed Liabilities
from and after the Closing Date and continuing until each Delayed Antitrust
Approval is obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
Delayed Antitrust Approval has not been obtained within twenty-four (24)
months of the Closing Date, TDY shall have the right at any time thereafter,
in its sole discretion, to sell any of the affected Tungsten Materials Assets,
the Shares or Assumed Liabilities to a third party at a price determined in
good faith by TDY to be a commercially reasonable price, and upon
consummation of any such sale, (x) TDY shall

 



33  pay the proceeds of such sale to Buyer (provided that TDY may reduce such
payment by an amount equal to its fees and expenses (or an estimate thereof)
and any incremental Taxes payable as a result of such sale) and (y) the
obligations of the parties pursuant to this Section 5.3(c) (other than
pursuant to the preceding clause (x)) with respect to such Tungsten Materials
Assets or Assumed Liabilities shall cease.

 

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date
(or such later date on which all transfers of the Tungsten Materials Business
and Tungsten Materials Assets contemplated by Section 5.18 have been
completed), except as required by this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not, without the prior written consent of TDY, engage in any action or
enter into any transaction or permit any action to be taken or transaction to
be entered into, that would reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of
Buyer or its Affiliates shall, and shall not cause any Person to, acquire
(whether via merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or
agree to so acquire, any assets of or any equity in any other Person or any
business or division thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement would not
reasonably be expected to materially (x) increase the risk of not obtaining
any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any waiting period under
any Regulatory Law; (y) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or materially increase the risk
of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (z)
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to
obtain all Permits, if any, relating to any Export Control and Import Laws
necessary for Buyer and its Affiliates, as applicable, to operate the Tungsten
Materials Business in their respective names, as the case may be, and TDY
shall cooperate with Buyer and its Affiliates in their efforts to obtain such
Permits.

Section 5.4 _Further Assurances_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement and subject to Section 5.3 and Section 5.18, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts before and after the Closing
Date to take or cause to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other party hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, (i) the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the
parties hereto; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from Governmental Authorities required to be obtained by TDY or
Buyer, or their respective Affiliates, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than with respect to Regulatory Laws
which are the subject of Section 5.3); (iii) to the extent consistent with
the obligations of the parties set forth in Section 5.3, the defending of any
Actions, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) the execution
and delivery of such instruments,

 



34  and the taking of such other actions, as the other party hereto may
reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement. TDY
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate with TDY, prior to the Closing Date, to obtain all consents and
approvals from applicable third parties to all Contracts of the Tungsten
Materials Business, including the Contracts set forth in Section 5.4 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ that neither party shall be required
to make any payments, incur any Liability or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any such third party in connection with
obtaining any such consents and approvals; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
TDY shall use its reasonable best efforts, and Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate with TDY, prior to the Closing Date, to obtain the consent to the
assignment to Buyer of the Contracts identified under the heading "Special
Consent" as set forth in Section 5.4 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule from
the applicable third party to such Contracts.

 

Section 5.5 _Intercompany Accounts and Arrangements_.

 

(a) All material intercompany arrangements and agreements, whether written or
oral, providing for the leasing or licensing of goods, services, tangible or
intangible properties or joint activities between ATI or any of the Retained
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and TDY (in respect of the Tungsten Materials
Business) or a Transferred Subsidiary, on the other hand, are set forth in
Section 5.5 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the " _Intercompany
Agreements_ "). Except for the Related Agreements, all intercompany
arrangements and agreements, whether written or oral, providing for the
leasing or licensing of goods, services, tangible or intangible properties or
joint activities between ATI or any of the Retained Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and TDY (in respect of the Tungsten Materials Business) or a Transferred
Subsidiary, on the other hand, including the Intercompany Agreements, shall
be terminated at TDYs expense by TDY (or TDY shall cause such agreements to
be terminated) and such agreements shall be of no further force and effect
after the Closing. Effective upon the Closing, all outstanding intercompany
accounts, whether payables or receivables, between ATI or any of the Retained
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and TDY (in respect of the Tungsten Materials
Business) or a Transferred Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be settled
and/or cancelled by TDY (or TDY shall cause such intercompany accounts to be
settled or cancelled) and such intercompany accounts shall be and of no
further force and effect (it being understood that such settlement
or cancellation shall not in any way affect the Related Agreements or any
amounts which may be payable pursuant to the Related Agreements).

 

(b) Provided TDY has satisfied its obligations under Section 5.5(a), effective
as of the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby
releases TDY and its Affiliates (and their respective officers, directors and
employees, acting in their capacity as such) from any Liability, obligation or
responsibility to any of them for any and all past actions or failures to
take action prior to the Closing, including any actions which may be deemed to
have been negligent or grossly negligent, relating to or arising out of
Contracts with ATI or a Subsidiary thereof or the operation or conduct of
any businesses, Assets (including activities performed thereat) or operations
managed or operated by, or operationally related to, directly or indirectly,
the Tungsten Materials Business or the Excluded Businesses, except for any
obligation pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Related
Agreements.

 



35 Section 5.6 _Provision of Corporate Records_. As soon as practicable on or
after the Closing Date, as permitted by Law, TDY shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer all
Transferred Tungsten Materials Books and Records then in the possession of ATI
or any Retained Subsidiary, and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to TDY all ATI Books and Records,
if any, then in the possession of Buyer or its Affiliates. The foregoing shall
be limited by the following specific provisions: 

(a) To the extent any document (other than that stored on electronic media)
can be subdivided without unreasonable effort into two portions, one of which
constitutes a Transferred Tungsten Materials Book and Record and the other of
which constitutes a ATI Book and Record, such document (other than that stored
on electronic media) shall be so sub-divided, and the original of the portion
such document (other than that stored on electronic media) which constitutes a
Transferred Tungsten Materials Book and Record shall be provided to Buyer
(with a copy thereof provided to TDY) and the original of the portion such
document (other than that stored on electronic media) which constitutes an ATI
Book and Record shall be provided to TDY (with a copy thereof provided to
Buyer).

 

(b) Neither party shall be required to conduct any company-wide search or
investigation of files.

 

(c) For purposes of this Section 5.6, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall
require deliveries of books and records that on their face are Transferred
Tungsten Materials Books and Records or ATI Books and Records, as applicable,
and any such specific and discrete books and records related to the Tungsten
Materials Business or the Excluded Businesses, as applicable, reasonably
requested in writing by either party and then in the possession of the other
party.

(d) Each party may retain copies of the books and records of the other
already in its possession, and may use such books and records as reasonably
required for its normal business purposes, subject to this Agreement and the
Related Agreements, and subject to holding in confidence information
contained in such books and records in accordance with the requirements and
limitations of this Agreement including Sections 5.13 and 5.14. If either
party has a reasonable concern regarding the other partys use of such books
and records, such party may, upon reasonable prior written notice and at such
partys expense, audit the other partys use of such books and records at
times and in a manner reasonably acceptable to all parties.

 

(e) Each party may refuse to furnish any Information if it believes in good
faith that doing so presents, based on an opinion of counsel (which can be
inside counsel), a significant risk of loss of the ability to successfully
assert a claim of Privilege; _provided_ that the parties hereto shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information without resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully assert
a claim of Privilege.

 



36 (f) Neither party shall be required to deliver to the other books and records
or portions thereof (i) if such delivery would violate any applicable Law or
(ii) which are subject to confidentiality agreements which would by their
terms prohibit such delivery; _provided_ , _however_ , if requested by the
other party, such party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek
a waiver of such confidentiality restriction.

(g) TDY may redact any Information covered by this Section 5.6 as and to the
extent such Information relates to the Excluded Businesses, the Excluded
Assets or the Retained Liabilities.

 

(h) Buyer may redact any Information covered by this Section 5.6 as and to the
extent such Information relates to Buyers business, assets or liabilities
other than the Tungsten Materials Assets, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the
Assumed Liabilities.

change, and cause their certificates of incorporation (or equivalent
organizational documents), as applicable, to be amended, to remove any
reference to "ATI", or any other Retained Name, (ii) 270 days following the
Closing Date, cease to use or to permit any third party to use any

its Affiliates (provided that Buyer may not create any new packaging or other
materials); and

(vi) Upon the expiration or termination of their respective rights under this
Section 5.7, Buyer and its Affiliates hereby assign to TDY their rights, if
any, to any Trademarks forming a part of or associated with the Retained Names
that they may retain. 

(c) At the request of TDY, Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to
provide to TDY reasonable and representative samples of products and
materials used or created under or in connection with this Section 5.7, in
their possession, custody, or under their control bearing any of the Retained
Names and shall permit TDY to inspect their premises and shall otherwise
cooperate with TDY to assist TDY in ensuring that the conditions of use of the
Retained Names set forth under Section 5.7(b) are complied with.

 

(d) Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no other right to use any of the
Retained Names except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.7.

Without limitation to any other remedies, if Buyer and its Affiliates fail to
comply with the foregoing terms and conditions or otherwise fail to comply
with any reasonable direction of TDY or any of its Affiliates in relation to
the use of the Retained Names, TDY shall (i) be entitled to seek a temporary,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other equitable relief in accordance
with Section 9.7, and (ii) have the right to terminate the foregoing permitted
use, effective immediately. Buyer and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold
harmless TDY and its Affiliates for any Losses arising from or relating to
the use by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the Retained Names pursuant to
this Section 5.7.

 

Section 5.8 _Employee Matters_. Subject to the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

 

(a) Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law and subject to
Section 5.8(m), not later than three (3) weeks before the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, offer employment to each
individual primarily employed in the Tungsten Materials Business by TDY or its
Affiliates as of the date of such offer (which employees are set forth on
Section 5.8(a) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, which Disclosure Schedule
shall be updated by TDY and provided to Buyer no later than two (2) weeks
before the Closing Date), subject to each persons completion

 



38  and satisfaction of Buyers customary pre-employment conditions, effective
as of the Closing Date on terms and conditions that are, at a minimum,
substantially similar to those in effect with respect to such individual as
in effect as of immediately before the Closing Date and providing, for one (1)
year following the Closing Date, for cash compensation (e.g., base salary or
wage rate, variable compensation and long-term compensation opportunity) not
less favorable than that in effect with respect to such individual immediately
before the Closing Date (or, for such individuals whose principal work
location is outside the United States, as otherwise required by law or local
custom) and benefits which are no less favorable than those benefits Buyer
customarily provides to its similarly-situated employees (after taking into
account Section 5.8(b)), as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
except as otherwise set forth in any agreement (other than this Agreement or
the Related Agreements) with any such employee or as required by applicable
Law, nothing herein shall preclude Buyer from terminating the employment of
any such employee at any time on or after the Closing. TDY shall cause its
Affiliates to cooperate with Buyer to encourage such individuals to accept
such offer of employment and to effect any communications, access to
populations, and such other actions as may be necessary or reasonable to
facilitate such employment offer. Each Business Employee who accepts such
offer of employment and commences employment with Buyer or its Affiliates on
his or her first regularly scheduled working day on or following the Closing
Date or, if later, upon return from an approved leave of absence, shall be
referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_." For the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer shall not be required to offer employment to any individual primarily
employed in the Tungsten Materials Business who is on long term disability
(and not on an approved leave of absence) as of the date hereof.

 

(b) On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and as applicable shall cause
its Affiliates to, give Transferred Employees service credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of future benefits under
any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the
benefit of similarly situated employees (after taking into account seniority
or length of service with TDY and its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ that
no Transferred Employee shall be entitled to participate in any benefit plan
of Buyer or its Affiliate that is frozen or closed to new entrants),
except to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of
benefits for service with TDY or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing
Date, but in any event only to the extent such service was recognized under a
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Section 5.8, as of the
Closing Date, with respect to any Liability or obligation to, or in respect
of, any Transferred Employee not otherwise provided for in this Agreement,
whether arising out of actions, events or omissions that occurred (or, in the
case of omissions, failed to occur) on or after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
assume and be solely responsible for all such Liabilities and obligations
whatsoever with respect to Transferred Employees to the extent such
Liabilities and obligations (i) arise or arose in connection with the conduct
or operation of the Tungsten Materials Business (exclusive of wages (including
bonuses and commissions), incentive compensation, equity compensation,
severance, and Benefit Plan contributions payable and/or accrued in respect
of the period before the Closing Date, which shall be paid by TDY or its
Affiliates (unless any such items are accrued as current

 



39  liabilities or adjustments specified in the calculation of the Final Net
Working Capital)) or (ii) arise or arose under Title VII of the United States
Civil Rights Act of 1964, the United States Civil Rights Act of 1991, the
United States Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the United States
Equal Pay Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the United States
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the United States Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and all other United
States federal, state or local statutes regulating the terms and conditions of
employment, or under the common law or in equity, including any claims
for wrongful discharge or otherwise. Buyer agrees to reimburse TDY, as soon
as practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days of receipt from TDY of
appropriate verification, for all costs and expenses actually paid by TDY or
its Affiliates after the Closing Date to the extent that the Liabilities
related to such costs and expenses have been assumed by Buyer pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this subsection (c).

 

(d) To the extent permitted by Law, Buyer shall, and as applicable shall cause
its Affiliates to, (i) cause any preexisting condition restrictions, other
restrictions or waiting periods under employee benefit plans of Buyer or its
Affiliates to be waived to the extent necessary to provide immediate coverage
to each Transferred Employee who was covered as of the Closing Date under
Benefit Plans that provide medical or dental benefits and (ii) cause any
employee benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates which is a welfare benefit
plan to apply any amounts paid under a welfare benefit plan of TDY or any of
its Affiliates by a Transferred Employee as deductibles and coinsurance during
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs toward deductible, coinsurance
and out-of-pocket limits under such plan of Buyer or its Affiliates for the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs (with appropriate adjustments for
differences in plan years).

(e) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, for a period of
one (1) year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, maintain a severance plan for the Transferred Employees which
provides for cash severance in the amount and upon the terms and conditions
(i.e., events of eligibility) substantially similar to the cash amounts and
terms and conditions as in effect on the date hereof in respect of existing
employees of Buyer on the date of this Agreement (exclusive of change in
control, equity acceleration, tax gross up, welfare benefit and any similar
provisions in any such severance program).

 

(f) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, honor all accrued but
untaken vacation credited to Transferred Employees under the paid time off
plans of TDY and its Affiliates that has not been cashed out on or before the
Closing Date and provide that, with respect to each Transferred Employee, for
a period of not less than one (1) year following the Closing Date, the rate
of accrual of hours of vacation or other paid-time-off for employment with
Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing shall not be less than such rate of
accrual with TDY or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(g) TDY or its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for all Liabilities
under the 401(k) Plan of ATI (the " _ATI 401(k) Plan_ "). Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer shall establish or maintain a defined contribution plan and
trust intended to qualify under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code
that on or after the Closing Date shall 

 



40  accept a contribution, in cash or, to the extent of any notes associated
with the outstanding balance of any loans to Transferred Employees, in kind,
attributable to any eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of the benefit of a Transferred Employee under
the ATI 401(k) Plan; _provided_ , that the obligation to accept such a
rollover in kind shall expire twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (or
at such other time as Buyer and TDY may mutually agree).

(h) Effective as of the Closing Date, TDY (or its Affiliates) shall retain
and be solely responsible for the Liabilities and obligations to or in respect
of Transferred Employees under any Benefit Plan not sponsored by a Transferred
Subsidiary, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.8(k).

(i) TDY (or its Affiliates) shall retain and be solely responsible for all
Liabilities and obligations with respect to Transferred Employees under all
United States defined benefit pension plans that are maintained by TDY or any
of its Affiliates and that are intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code, including without limitation the Allegheny
Technologies Incorporated Pension Plan, and accordingly there shall be no
transfer of assets or liabilities among TDY, Buyer, any of their Affiliates or
their respective plans in respect of such defined benefit pension plans.

(j) TDY (or its Affiliates) shall retain and be solely responsible for all
Liabilities to Transferred Employees under each post-retirement welfare
benefit plan maintained by ATI or its Subsidiaries for Business Employees
whose principal work location is in the United States as of the Closing Date.
TDY (or its Affiliates) shall provide and be solely responsible for any
continuation coverage required under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA or applicable state law (" _COBRA_ ") in respect of each
Business Employee whose "qualifying event" (as defined in COBRA) occurs on or
prior to the Closing Date. TDY shall provide any certificates of creditable
coverage under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
required by reason of transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(k) The Assumed Collective Bargaining Agreement and the Multiemployer Plan
will be addressed as follows:

(i) Buyer shall negotiate in good faith with the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, Local Lodge No. 2530 and use its
reasonable best efforts to assume the Assumed Collective Bargaining Agreement,
and effective upon the Closing, Buyer shall have the sole responsibility for
all Liabilities under the Assumed Collective Bargaining Agreement (arising on
or after the Closing Date), including, without limitation, the obligation to
make contributions on behalf of the Transferred Employees to the multiemployer
plan identified in Section 5.8(k) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule(the "
_Multiemployer Plan_ "). Buyer shall be obligated to contribute to the
Multiemployer Plan for substantially the same number of contribution base
units for which TDY had an obligation to contribute for the Business
Employees covered by the Assumed Collective Bargaining Agreement immediately
prior to the Closing Date (which obligation shall be interpreted in a manner
consistent with Section 4204(a)(1)(A) of ERISA).

 



41 (ii) Buyer and TDY intend that the sale of assets under this Agreement
shall constitute a sale of assets under Section 4204 of ERISA in order to
avoid the immediate imposition of complete or partial withdrawal liability on
TDY to the Multiemployer Plan with respect to the Tungsten Materials Business.
Accordingly, Buyer and TDY agree to take all actions necessary to comply with
Section 4204 of ERISA, including using reasonable good faith efforts to
persuade the Multiemployer Plan that Section 4204 of ERISA applies, amending
this Agreement if necessary to meet the specific requirements of the
Multiemployer Plan to comply with Section 4204 of ERISA, and, subject to
clause (iii) below, Buyers provision to the Multiemployer Plan for a period
of five (5) plan years (defined by the Multiemployer Plan), commencing with
the first plan year beginning after the Closing Date, of a bond issued by a
corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of Section
412 of ERISA, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial
institution, satisfactory to the Multiemployer Plan (such bond or escrow shall
be in satisfaction of Section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA), and which bond or
escrow shall be paid to the Multiemployer Plan if Buyer withdraws from the
Multiemployer Plan, or fails to make a contribution when due, at any time
during the first five plan years beginning after the Closing Date, and such
bond or escrow (unless waived by the Multiemployer Plan) shall be in an amount
equal to the greater of:

(A) the average annual contribution required to be made by TDY to the
Multiemployer Plan with respect to the Tungsten Materials Business under the
Assumed Collective Bargaining Agreement for the three plan years preceding the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, and

 

(B) the annual contribution that TDY was required to make to the Multiemployer
Plan with respect to the Tungsten Materials Business under the Assumed
Collective Bargaining Agreement for the last plan year prior to the plan year
in which the Closing Date occurs.

 

If, despite the reasonable good faith efforts of the parties to have the sale
of the Tungsten Materials Assets treated as a sale of assets under Section
4204 of ERISA, the Multiemployer Plan nevertheless determines that Section
4204 of ERISA has not been satisfied, TDY shall be solely liable for any
withdrawal liability incurred as of the Closing Date due to the sale of
the Tungsten Materials Assets hereunder and the following provisions of this
Section 5.8(k) shall be inapplicable.

(iii) The cost of each bond, escrow or other surety device, if not waived,
shall be paid by Buyer, and Buyer shall be the sole obligor thereunder. At
Buyers sole discretion, and in lieu of the bond or escrow described in clause
(ii) Buyer may prepare and submit to the Multiemployer Plan or the Pension

 



42  Benefit Guaranty Corporation a request for a waiver, variance or exemption
from the bond or escrow requirement, and TDY shall cooperate with Buyer in
connection with such filing. Buyer shall provide written evidence to TDY that
Section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA has been timely satisfied or a waiver,
variance, or exemption has been approved, as applicable.

 

(iv) In the event that any withdrawal liability is imposed on Buyer by the
Multiemployer Plan during any period when TDY is primarily or secondarily
liable for such liability pursuant to Section 5.8(k)(ii) or 5.8(k)(vi), Buyer
shall use its reasonable good faith efforts to obtain and negotiate the lowest
practicable amount thereof, subject to mutual agreement among Buyer and TDY
(and in coming to an agreement, each of the parties agree to not unreasonably
withhold or delay their consent).

 

(v) If Buyer withdraws from a Multiemployer Plan in a complete or partial
withdrawal with respect to the Tungsten Materials Business and withdrawal
liability is imposed upon and paid by Buyer with respect to such complete or
partial withdrawal, Buyer shall be responsible for all withdrawal liability
applicable under Title IV of ERISA to such complete or partial withdrawal.

(vi) To the extent required under Section 4204(a)(2) of ERISA, if Buyer
withdraws from the Multiemployer Plan in a complete or partial withdrawal
with respect to the Tungsten Materials Business during the first five (5) plan
years beginning after the Closing Date, and Buyer fails to pay all or any
portion of its withdrawal liability payments to such Multiemployer Plan, TDY
shall be secondarily liable to such Multiemployer Plan for any withdrawal
liability amount not paid by Buyer.

 

(l) Nothing in this Section 5.8 shall (i) amend, or be deemed to amend, any
Benefit Plan or restrict Buyers or its Affiliates right to amend or
terminate any benefit plan of Buyer or an Affiliate, as applicable, (ii)
provide any Person not a party to this Agreement with any right, benefit or
remedy with regard to any Benefit Plan or a right to enforce any provision of
this Agreement, or (iii) require Buyer or its Affiliates to continue the
employment of any Person, or otherwise interfere with Buyers (or its
Affiliates) right to discharge, demote, or reassign any individual at any
time.

(m) This Section 5.8 shall not apply to the employees of the Transferred
Subsidiaries whose employment with the relevant Transferred Subsidiary shall
continue after Closing and whose terms and conditions of employment will be
governed by applicable Contracts and applicable Laws.

 

(n) At the Closing the Transferred Subsidiaries shall have cash available in
an amount equal to the accrued state pension obligations for employees in
France, Germany and Italy (which as of June 30, 2013 was approximately
$1,400,000) and such cash shall be deemed not to be a Cash Equivalent and such
cash shall be transferred to Buyer at Closing.

 



43 Section 5.9 _Real Property Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, TDY shall: (a)
use commercially reasonable efforts to initiate, prosecute and complete in
accordance with all governmental requirements, the Subdivision; _provided_ ,
that if the Subdivision is not completed on or prior to the Closing Date, TDY
shall enter into a short term lease and agreement of sale with Buyer at the
Closing to effectuate the intent of the parties to transfer the parcel as soon
as practicable following the completion of the Subdivision, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to TDY and Buyer; (b) proceed diligently
toward acquiring fee simple title to the real property located at 148 Little
Cove Road, Gurley, Alabama currently leased by TDY and for which the option to
purchase has been exercised by TDY; and (c) exercise the purchase option
related to the Leased Real Property located in Grant, Alabama and if requested
by Buyer enter into negotiations with the landlord to extend the Lease related
to such Leased Real Property on terms presented by Buyer.

Section 5.10 _Post-Closing Access to Information_. For a period of five (5)
years from the Closing Date, except as prohibited by applicable Law, TDY and
Buyer shall, subject to compliance by the other with the provisions of Section
5.13 and any Related Agreements, afford to each other and to each others
Representatives reasonable access and duplicating rights (with copying costs
to be borne by the requesting party) during normal business hours to all books
and records, documents and other information (collectively, " _Information_ ")
within the knowledge, possession or control of the other party or its
Affiliates solely to the extent relating to (a) in the case of requests by
Buyer, the Tungsten Materials Business, Tungsten Materials Assets, Assumed
Liabilities or Transferred Employees and (b) in the case of requests by TDY,
the Excluded Businesses, the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities,
insofar in each case as such access is reasonably required by TDY or Buyer or
any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates for legitimate business reasons and
does not violate any applicable Law or any confidentiality obligations
applicable to TDY or Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as the
case may be (and shall use reasonable efforts to cause persons or firms
possessing relevant Information to give similar access) and, to the extent
practicable, such Information is identified by the requesting party with
reasonable specificity; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be
required to disclose any Information if (i) it believes in good faith that
doing so presents a significant risk, based on an opinion of counsel (which
can be inside counsel) of resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully
assert a claim of Privilege or (ii) TDY or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse
parties in a litigation (other than a litigation with respect to a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement) and such information is reasonably
pertinent thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the case of clause (i)
above, the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to find a way
to allow disclosure of such information without resulting in a loss of the
ability to successfully assert a claim of Privilege; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that TDY and its Affiliates shall not be required to provide Buyer or its
Representatives with any information related to the Sale Process or TDYs or
its Representatives evaluation thereof, including projections, financial or
other information related thereto other than projections, financial or other
information prepared in the ordinary course of the Tungsten Materials Business
without being primarily prepared for the Sale Process. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Information may be requested under this Section
5.10 for audit and accounting purposes and in connection with Actions, as well
as for purposes of fulfilling disclosure and reporting obligations.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, following Closing and for as
long as such retention is required in accordance with TDY (or ATIs) 

 



44  corporate records and information policies, as in effect as of the date
hereof, or applicable Law (with the longer durational requirement to govern),
Buyer shall retain all medical and exposure records of Business Employees and
afford TDY and its Affiliates and Representatives with reasonable access to
such medical and exposure records.

 

Section 5.11 _Production of Witnesses and Individuals_. From and after the
Closing Date, TDY and Buyer shall use and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use reasonable efforts to make available to each other, upon
written request, their respective officers, directors, employees and agents
for fact finding, consultation and interviews and as witnesses to the
extent that any such person may reasonably be required in connection with any
Actions in which the requesting party may from time to time be involved
relating to the conduct of the Tungsten Materials Business or the Excluded
Businesses. TDY and Buyer agree to reimburse each other for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses (other than officers or employees salaries) incurred by
the other in connection with providing individuals and witnesses pursuant to
this Section 5.11. Subject to the terms and conditions of Article VIII, in
the event that TDY, Buyer or their respective Affiliates shall participate in
any Action concerning the Tungsten Materials Business conducted prior to the
Closing Date, including the Powders Litigation, the parties shall, upon the
request of the party involved in such Action, cooperate fully with such party
in connection therewith, subject to reimbursement by the requesting party for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the cooperating party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall not apply to Actions
brought between TDY and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its
Affiliates on the other hand.

 

Section 5.12 _Retention of Records_. Except when a longer retention period is
otherwise required by Law or agreed to in writing, including as set forth in
Section 6.4, TDY (in respect of the Tungsten Materials Business) and its
Affiliates shall retain, in accordance with their respective records control
schedule policy existing from time to time, copies of all Information
relating to the Tungsten Materials Business and the Excluded Businesses,
respectively. The parties hereto agree that upon written request from the
other that certain Information relating to the Tungsten Materials Business or
the transactions contemplated hereby be retained in connection with an
Action, the parties shall use reasonable efforts to preserve and not to
destroy or dispose of such Information without the consent of the requesting
party.

 

Section 5.13 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) For a period of ten (10) years from the Closing Date, TDY and Buyer shall
hold and shall cause their respective Affiliates to hold, and shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to
hold, in strict confidence and not to disclose or release without the prior
written consent of the other party, any and all Confidential Information (as
defined herein); _provided_ , that the parties may disclose, or may permit
disclosure of, Confidential Information (i) to their respective
Representatives who have a need to know such information and are informed of
their obligation to hold such information confidential to the same extent as
is applicable to the parties hereto and in respect of whose failure to comply
with such obligations, TDY or Buyer, as the case may be, will be responsible
or (ii) if the parties hereto, their Affiliates or their Representatives are
compelled to disclose any such Confidential Information by judicial or
administrative process or, in the opinion of independent legal counsel, by
other 

 



45  requirements of Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
demand or request for disclosure of Confidential Information is made pursuant
to clause (ii) above, TDY or Buyer, as the case may be, shall promptly notify
the other of the existence of such request or demand and shall provide the
other a reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order or
other remedy, which both parties will reasonably cooperate in obtaining (each
at their own expense). In the event that such appropriate protective order or
other remedy is not obtained, the party who is required to disclose such
Confidential Information shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, only
that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be
disclosed. As used in this Section 5.13, " _Confidential Information_ " shall
mean all proprietary technical, economic, environmental, operational,
financial and/or other business Information or material of one party which,
prior to or following the Closing Date, has been disclosed by TDY or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer or its Affiliates, on the other hand, in
written, oral (including by recording), electronic, or visual form to, or
otherwise has come into the possession of, the other, in each case including
pursuant to the access provisions of Section 5.10 hereof or any other
provision of this Agreement or any Related Agreement, (A) in the case of TDY
and its Affiliates and Representatives, to the extent relating to the Tungsten
Materials Business or the Tungsten Materials Assets prior to the Closing or
(B) in the case of Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives, to the
extent relating to the Excluded Assets, the Retained Liabilities or the
Excluded Businesses, including (a) ideas and concepts for existing products,
processes and services; (b) specifications for products, Equipment and
processes; (c) manufacturing and performance specifications and procedures;
(d) engineering drawings and graphs; (e) technical, research and engineering
data; (f) formulations and material specifications; (g) laboratory studies
and benchmark tests; (h) service and operation manuals; (i) quality assurance
policies, procedures and specifications; (j) evaluation and/or validation
studies; (k) pending patent applications; (l) all other know-how,
methodology, procedures, techniques and trade secrets related to research,
engineering, development and manufacturing; and (m) business information,
including marketing and development plans, forecasts, research and
development agreements, and customer and vendor information (except to the
extent that such Information can be shown to have been (1) in the public
domain through no fault of such party or its Affiliates (including, in the
case of TDY, any of the Retained Subsidiaries or, in the case of Buyer, any
of its Subsidiaries) or (2) lawfully acquired from other sources by the party
(or its Affiliates) to which it was furnished including pursuant to this
Agreement or the Related Agreements;  _provided_ , _however_ , in the case of
(2) that such sources did not provide such Information in breach of any
confidentiality or other legal obligations). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall prevent (1) ATI or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or
their respective Representatives from disclosing or using any Confidential
Information used or held for use in any Excluded Business or (2) Buyer or its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives from disclosing or using any
Confidential Information used or held for use in the Tungsten Materials
Business from and after the Closing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) TDY and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand
shall be deemed to have satisfied their obligations hereunder with respect to
Confidential Information if they exercise the same degree of care (but no less
than a reasonable degree 

 



46  of care) as they take to preserve confidentiality for their own similar
Information and (ii) confidentiality obligations provided for in any agreement
between TDY or any of its Affiliates (or Buyer or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the Tungsten Materials Business), on the one hand and any employee
of TDY or any of its Affiliates, or Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand shall remain in full force and effect. Confidential Information of
TDY and its Affiliates, on the one hand, or the Tungsten Materials Business,
on the other hand, in the possession of and used by the other as of the
Closing Date may continue to be used by TDY or its Affiliates, or Buyer or
its Affiliates, as the case may be, in the operation of their businesses, so
long as the Confidential Information is maintained in confidence and not
disclosed in violation of this Agreement. Such continued right to use may not
be transferred to any third party (other than an Affiliate of a party hereto)
unless the third party purchases all or substantially all of the business and
Assets in one transaction or in a series of related transactions for which or
in which the relevant Confidential Information is used or employed.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5.13, to the extent that a
Related Agreement or another Contract pursuant to which a party hereto is
bound provides that certain Confidential Information shall be maintained
confidential on a basis that is more protective of such Confidential
Information or for a longer period of time than provided for in this Section
5.13, then the applicable provisions contained in such Related Agreement or
other Contract shall control with respect thereto.

 

Section 5.14 _Non-Competition_.

 

(a) Commencing on and for a period of three (3) years following the Closing
Date, TDY shall not, and shall cause ATI and the Subsidiaries of ATI not to,
develop, manufacture, market or sell the Products (the " _Prohibited
Activities_ ").

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that nothing herein shall
prohibit TDY or ATI or any of their respective Subsidiaries from:

(i) acquiring or investing in any Person, or the assets thereof, if less than
ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues, assets and income of such Person or
assets (based on such Persons latest annual audited consolidated financial
statements) are generated directly from the Prohibited Activities;

 

(ii) acquiring or investing in any Person, or the assets thereof, if ten
percent (10%) or more than ten percent (10%), but not more than thirty
percent (30%) of the gross revenues, assets and income of such Person or
assets (based on such Persons latest annual audited consolidated financial
statements) are generated directly from the Prohibited Activities; 
_provided_ , that within one (1) year of such acquisition, TDY, ATI or any of
their respective Subsidiaries enter into a definitive agreement to divest
themselves of all or substantially all of the assets or operations so acquired
that are engaged in any of the Prohibited Activities (and use commercially
reasonable efforts to consummate such transaction within such one (1) year
period);

 



47 (iii) acquiring, solely as an investment, securities of any Person traded on
any national securities exchange if TDY, ATI or their respective Subsidiary,
as applicable, is not a controlling Person of, or a member of a group which
controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own five percent
(5%) of the outstanding voting power of such Person; or

(iv) acquiring or investing in any equity interest in any Person through
any employee benefit plan of TDY, ATI or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

(c) The parties agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 5.13(a), the provisions of Section 5.13(a) shall not prohibit (i) TDY
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from performing under any Contract or
Shared Contract or owning or operating any other Asset that constitutes a
Tungsten Materials Asset which is not transferred, conveyed or assigned to
Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date or (ii) TDY or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from performing its obligations under this
Agreement or any Related Agreement.

(d) The term " _Products_ " shall mean the following: (i) carbide tool
systems, specialty abrasives, carbide burrs and routers and thread cutting and
thread rolling tools for use in metal cutting and metal finishing; (ii) rough

Section 5.15 _Mail and Other Communications; Accounts_.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, each of TDY and its Affiliates and Buyer and its
Affiliates may receive mail, packages and other communications (including
electronic communications) properly belonging to the other (or the others
Affiliates). Accordingly, at all times after the Closing Date, each of TDY and
Buyer authorizes the other and their respective Affiliates to receive and
open all mail, packages and other communications received by it and not
unambiguously intended for the other party (or its Affiliates) or any of the
other partys (or its Affiliates) officers or directors, and to retain
the same to the extent that they relate to the Tungsten Materials Business
(in the case of receipt by Buyer and its Affiliates) or the Excluded
Businesses (in the case of receipt by TDY and its Affiliates), or to the
extent that they do not relate to the Tungsten Materials Business (in the
case of receipt by Buyer and its Affiliates) or the Excluded Businesses (in
the case of receipt by TDY and its Affiliates), the receiving party shall
promptly after becoming aware thereof refer, forward or otherwise deliver
such mail, packages or other communications (or, in case the same relate to
both the Tungsten Materials Business and the Excluded Businesses, copies
thereof) to the other party. The provisions of this Section 5.15 are
not intended to, and shall not be deemed to, constitute an authorization by
either TDY or Buyer to permit the other to accept service of process on its
behalf, and neither party is or shall be deemed to be the agent of the other
for service of process purposes.

 



48 (b) All payments and reimbursements received by TDY or its Affiliates
in connection with or arising out of the Tungsten Materials Business, the
Tungsten Materials Assets or the Assumed Liabilities after the Closing shall
be held by such Person in trust for the benefit of Buyer and, immediately upon
receipt by such Person of any such payment or reimbursement, such Person
shall pay over to Buyer the amount of such payment or reimbursement, without
right of set off.

 

(c) All payments and reimbursements received by Buyer or its Affiliates in
connection with or arising out of the Excluded Assets, Retained Liabilities
or Excluded Businesses, after the Closing shall be held by such Person in
trust for the benefit of TDY and, immediately upon receipt by such Person of
any such payment or reimbursement such person shall pay over to TDY the
amount of such payment or reimbursement without right of set off.

Section 5.16 _Compliance with WARN Act and Similar Statutes_. Buyer agrees
that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the " _WARN Act_ ") and
any applicable state, local and foreign plant closing and layoff law as it
relates to any site of employment of the Tungsten Materials Business. Buyer
agrees to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless TDY and its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses which TDY
and its Affiliates may incur in connection with any Action or claim of
violation brought against TDY and any Affiliate under the WARN Act or any
state, local and foreign plant closing and layoff law, which relate, in whole
or in part, to actions taken by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries following
the Closing Date with regard to any site of employment of the Tungsten
Materials Business. TDY shall take all actions required under the WARN Act in
connection with the termination of the Transferred Employees by TDY or its
Affiliates prior to, or in connection with, the Closing.

Section 5.17 _Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) With respect to Shared Contractual Liabilities pursuant to, under or
relating to a given Shared Contract, such Shared Contractual Liabilities
shall, unless otherwise allocated pursuant to this Agreement or a Related
Agreement, be allocated between TDY and Buyer as follows:

 

(i) If a Liability is incurred exclusively in respect of the Tungsten
Materials Business or the Excluded Businesses, such Liability shall be
allocated to Buyer (in respect of the Tungsten Materials Business) or TDY (in
respect of the Excluded Businesses);

 

(ii) If a Liability cannot be so allocated under clause (i) above, such
Liability shall be allocated to TDY or Buyer, as the case may be, based on
the relative proportions of total benefit received (over the term of the
Shared Contract remaining as of the Closing Date, measured as of the date of
the allocation) by the Tungsten Materials Business or the Excluded Business
under the relevant Shared Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of TDY
and Buyer shall be responsible for any or all Liabilities arising from its (or
its Subsidiarys) breach of 

 



49  the relevant Shared Contract to which this Section 5.17 otherwise pertains;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each of TDY and Buyer shall be entitled to
indemnification from the other for the portion of any Liabilities arising
from any breach of the relevant Shared Contract by the other party (or its
Subsidiary), which indemnification shall be separate from and not subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.4.

 

(b) If TDY or any Retained Subsidiary, on the one hand, or Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, receives any benefit or payment which under
any Shared Contract was intended for the other, TDY and Buyer will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to, and to cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, deliver such benefit or payment to the other party. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that
the Shared Contracts listed on Section 5.17(c)(i) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed to be Tungsten Materials Assets hereunder (the "
_Excluded Shared Contracts_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, the parties
have determined that it is advisable that certain Shared Contracts, which are
identified on Section 5.17(c)(ii) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, be
separated into separate Contracts between the appropriate third party and
either the Excluded Businesses or the Tungsten Materials Business. The
parties agree to cooperate and provide reasonable assistance prior to the
Closing (with no obligation on the part of either party to pay any costs or
fees with respect to such assistance) in effecting the separation of such
Shared Contracts. If such Shared Contracts are not separated at Closing, the
parties agree to continue to provide each other with reasonable cooperation
and assistance in effecting the separation of such Shared Contracts and shall
treat the same as Shared Contracts or take such reasonable steps as are
necessary to provide each party the benefit of such Contracts.

 

Section 5.18 _Obligations Regarding Non-Assignable Assets_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, unless
and until such license, consent, approval or amendment described below is no
longer required or has been obtained, this Agreement and the Related
Agreements shall not constitute an agreement to assign, license, sublicense,
lease, sublease, convey or transfer at the Closing any Tungsten Materials
Assets or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom as to which consent or approval from any Person (including any and
all licenses to be granted by, and any and all consents and approvals of,
Governmental Authorities) to assignment, license, sublicense, lease,
sublease, conveyance or transfer thereof or amendment thereof is required but
has not been obtained as of the Closing Date (such Tungsten Materials Assets,
a " _Delayed Tungsten Materials Assets_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , to the
extent not inconsistent with the terms of any Delayed Tungsten Materials
Assets or applicable Law, the parties shall treat Buyer as the owner thereof
for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _further_ , that,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither TDY or any of its
Affiliates nor Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall be required to commence
any litigation or offer or pay any money or otherwise grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party. Without limiting the generality
of Section 5.3 and Section 5.4, TDY and Buyer shall use,

 



50  and cause each of their Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any such license, consent, approval or amendment, including after
the Closing Date. Upon obtaining the requisite licenses, consents or
approvals, unless otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement,
such Delayed Tungsten Materials Assets shall be transferred and assigned to
Buyer hereunder at no cost to Buyer without additional consideration
therefor.

(b) In the event and to the extent that, prior to the Closing, TDY or any
Retained Subsidiary is unable to obtain a license, consent, approval or
amendment required to assign, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey or
transfer any Delayed Tungsten Materials Assets to Buyer, then following the
Closing, TDY shall, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to, in each case, subject to the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement, (i) continue to hold, and to the extent
required by the terms applicable to such Delayed Tungsten Materials Assets,
operate such Delayed Tungsten Materials Asset in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and taking into
account the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) cooperate
in any arrangement, reasonable and lawful as to TDY and Buyer, designed to
provide to Buyer or its Subsidiaries the benefits arising under such Delayed
Tungsten Materials Assets, including accepting such reasonable direction as
Buyer shall request of TDY or its Affiliates, and (iii) enforce at Buyers
request, or allow Buyer and its Affiliates to enforce in a commercially
reasonable manner, any rights of TDY or its Affiliates, as applicable, under
such Delayed Tungsten Materials Assets against the other party or parties
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the costs and expenses incurred by TDY
or its Affiliates at Buyers request shall be borne by Buyer. Subject to the
terms of the Transition Services Agreement, TDY shall, and shall cause the
Retained Subsidiaries to, without further consideration therefor, pay and
remit to Buyer promptly all monies, rights and other consideration received in
respect of such performance. Subject to the terms of the Transition Services
Agreement, Buyer shall pay, perform and discharge fully, promptly when due,
all of the obligations of TDY or the Retained Subsidiaries in respect of such
performance, and Buyer shall be responsible for all Assumed
Liabilities related thereto and indemnify TDY Indemnified Parties for all
Losses arising out of any actions (or omissions to act) of TDY or any Retained
Subsidiary arising out of such performance or taken at the direction of Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Section 5.18, neither TDY
nor any other of its Affiliates shall be required to take any action that
may, in the good faith judgment of TDY or such Affiliate, (i) result in a
violation of any obligation which TDY or any such Affiliate has to any third
party or (ii) violate applicable Law.

 

(d) Buyer agrees that TDY and its Affiliates shall not have any liability
whatsoever arising out of or relating to, the failure to obtain any consents,
approvals or licenses that may have been or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default
under or acceleration or termination of any Contracts, Permits
or Environmental Permits or other right or obligation, as a result thereof,
other than as provided in Section 8.2. Buyer further agrees that no
representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation of TDY contained
herein 

 



51  shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition to Buyers
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of the failure to obtain any such
consent, approval or license or as a result of any such default, acceleration
or termination.

 

Section 5.19 _Schedule Updates_. If there occurs, after the date of this
Agreement any fact or condition that renders any representation or warranty
made by TDY in ARTICLE III untrue or if any fact or condition requires any
change in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule delivered to Buyer at the time of
execution of this Agreement, TDY will have the right, at its election, to
deliver to Buyer at or before the Closing, and no later than seven (7)
Business Days after learning of the occurrence of such fact or condition, a
supplement to the Sellers Disclosure Schedule specifying any needed
change. Any such supplement to Sellers Disclosure Schedule shall not be
given effect for purposes of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(d) herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that such supplement to
Sellers Disclosure Schedule shall be given effect for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach of a representation and warranty
for purposes of the indemnification provisions under Section 8.4(a) hereof;
and _provided_   _further_ , that Buyer expressly acknowledges that TDY shall
be permitted to supplement the Sellers Disclosure Schedule to reflect the
actions required by Section 5.9 (and any such supplement shall be given effect
for purposes of Section 7.3(a), Section 7.3(d) and Section 8.4(a)).

Section 5.20 _Related Agreements and Other Agreements_. The parties hereto
agree to enter into, and to cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to
enter into, each of the Related Agreements to which it is contemplated to be a
party at or prior to the Closing Date. To the extent there is a conflict
between any of the provisions of this Agreement and any of the Related
Agreements, the provisions of such Related Agreement shall control with
respect to the subject matter thereof. Provided that it is not a condition to
Closing, Buyer and TDY shall negotiate in good faith to enter into prior to
the Closing Date in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the parties
(i) a lease from Buyer to in favor of an Affiliate of TDY related to certain
space currently leased by ATI Wah Chang in Madison, Alabama based on the
material terms set forth in Schedule 3 of the Transition Services Agreement,
(ii) a lease from Buyer in favor of an Affiliate of TDY related to certain
space currently leased by ATI Wah Chang in Huntsville, Alabama based on the
material terms set forth in Schedule 4 of the Transition Services Agreement,
(iii) a Conversion Services Agreement related to conversion services to be
performed by Buyer for an Affiliate of TDY based on the material terms
set forth in Schedule 5 of the Transition Service Agreement and (iv) an arms
length supply agreement pursuant to which the Tungsten Materials Business will
supply powders to TDY and its Affiliates following Closing.

 

Section 5.21 _Transfer of Permits and Environmental Permits_. Buyer shall be
responsible for preparing and submitting, on a timely basis, all filings
required to effect the transfer of all Permits and Environmental Permits held
in connection with the operation of the Tungsten Materials Assets to Buyer. A
list of material Permits and material Environmental Permits to be transferred
is set forth on Section 5.21(i) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule. Schedule
5.21(ii) sets forth all Non-Transferable Permits that are material to the
conduct of the Tungsten Materials Business. TDY shall cooperate with
Buyer with respect to the preparation and filing of such transfer requests,
including executing any necessary forms as required and

 



52  providing information in TDYs possession to Buyer that is necessary or
useful for any such transfer request. If any Permits or Environmental Permits
cannot be transferred to Buyer prior to the Closing Date, TDY shall allow
Buyer to operate under any such Permit or Environmental Permit until the same
is obtained by Buyer, provided that Buyer uses good faith efforts to obtain
any such Permits or Environmental Permits and indemnifies TDY for any fines,
penalties or Environmental Claims to the extent resulting from Buyers
operations under any TDY Permit or Environmental Permit.

 

Section 5.22 _Financial Assurance_. As required by applicable Law and as soon
as practicable after Closing, but in any event no later than thirty (30) days
after Closing unless otherwise allowed by applicable Law, Buyer shall submit
to the appropriate regulatory agencies documentation satisfactory to such
agencies that it has procured financial assurance, in compliance with
applicable Laws, Permits and Environmental Permits, to replace the financial
assurance provided by TDY or its Affiliates pursuant to such Laws, Permits and
Environmental Permits. A schedule of the financial assurance required to be
obtained by Buyer is set forth on Section 5.22 of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule.

Section 5.23 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date, the Tungsten
Materials Business, the Tungsten Materials Assets and Assumed Liabilities
shall cease to be insured by TDY or its Affiliates insurance policies or by
any of their self-insured programs for Losses incurred after the Closing
Date, and neither Buyer nor its Subsidiaries shall have any access, right,
title or interest to or in any such insurance policies (including to all
claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) on or after the
Closing to cover any Losses incurred after the Closing Date related to the
Tungsten Materials Assets or Assumed Liabilities or any Liability arising from
the operation of the Tungsten Materials Business after the Closing Date. TDY
or its Affiliates may, to be effective at the Closing, amend any insurance
policies in the manner it deems appropriate to give effect to this Section
5.23. For Losses incurred prior to the Closing Date that are Assumed
Liabilities related to Third Party Claims (whether arising prior to or
following the Closing Date), and for which rights, if any, to insurance
benefits and proceeds are being transferred in the Sale, TDY shall and shall
cause its Affiliates to reasonably cooperate with Buyer to make available
to Buyer the benefits, if any, that are being transferred in the Sale, under
its third party insurance policies, including, if reasonably requested by
Buyer, notifying the applicable insurers and seeking their acknowledgment or
consent thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , that TDY and its Affiliates make
no representations, warranties or covenants that any of their insurance
policies provide coverage for any Assumed Liabilities or that the assignment
of any insurance rights to Buyer in the Sale is or shall be valid, effective
or enforceable. Buyer acknowledges that such policies, as well as other
policies issued to TDY and/or its Affiliates, are or may be subject to various
limitations, including self-insurance features, retrospectively-rated
premiums, insurer insolvencies, impairment, erosion, exhaustion, and various
settlements and/or releases that may impose defense, indemnification or other
obligations on TDY or its Affiliates. Buyer further acknowledges that, if
Buyers assertion of insurance rights transferred in the Sale gives rise to
any material obligations, including any material obligations arising under any
self-insurance features, such as deductibles, retentions or retrospectively-
rated premiums, or to any defense or indemnification obligations related to
insurance settlement(s), such material obligations shall be considered Assumed
Liabilities.

representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein or

failure by Buyer to consummate the Closing at any time at which TDY shall have

hereby, whether obtained before or after the execution hereof;

 

(b) all Information received by Buyer with respect to the business,
operations, Assets or financial condition of ATI or its Subsidiaries shall
remain subject to the Confidentiality Agreement; and

(c) notwithstanding the termination hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the following Sections of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect: (i) Section 3.16 and Section 4.4 relating to brokers, (ii) the
penultimate sentence of Section 5.2 relating to confidentiality matters,
(iii) Section 9.13 relating to certain expenses, (iv) Section 8.1 and this
Section 8.2 and (v) ARTICLE IX.

 

Section 8.3 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Except in
the case of claims based on fraud or intentional misconduct, the
representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the Closing and
shall thereupon terminate on the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing
Date, except for (i) the Fundamental Representations, which shall survive the
Closing forever and (ii) the Special Representations, which shall survive for
the

 



58  Special Representations Period. All covenants and agreements contained
herein which by their terms contemplate actions or impose obligations
following the Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, (x) the obligations of Buyer to assume, and to indemnify TDY
Indemnified Parties for, the Assumed Liabilities and (y) the obligations of
TDY to retain, and indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties for, the Retained
Liabilities shall in each case survive the Closing indefinitely.

 

Section 8.4 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to Section 8.3 and this Section
8.4, TDY shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Subsidiaries and
each of their Affiliates and each of Buyers, its Subsidiaries, and its
Affiliates respective officers, directors, employees, and agents
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any
Losses arising from or in connection with (i) the failure of TDY or the Share
Sellers to duly perform or observe any covenant or agreement to be performed
or observed by TDY or the Share Sellers pursuant to this Agreement (the
remedy for which survives the Closing) or any Related Agreement, (ii) any of
the Retained Liabilities, (iii) any breach of any representation of TDY set
forth in ARTICLE III of this Agreement, or (iv) the Thoriated Powder
Obligations.

(b) From and after the Closing, and subject to Section 8.3 and this Section
8.4, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless TDY, ATI and each of their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates and each of TDYs, ATIs, their
Subsidiaries and their Affiliates respective officers, directors, employees,
and agents (collectively, the " _TDY Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against
any Losses arising from or in connection with (i) the failure of Buyer or any
Buyer Designee to duly perform or observe any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Buyer or any Buyer Designee pursuant to this
Agreement (the remedy for which survives the Closing) or any Related
Agreement, (ii) any of the Assumed Liabilities (regardless of whether such
Assumed Liabilities were assumed by Buyer or any Buyer Designee pursuant to
Section 1.3), or (iii) any breach of any representation of Buyer set forth in
ARTICLE IV of this Agreement.

 

(c) Any calculation of Losses for purposes of this Section 8.4 (including for
purposes of determining the amount of Losses for purposes of sub-sections (h)
and (i) below) shall be (i) net of any insurance or other third party recovery
actually paid to the Indemnified Party (whether paid directly to such
Indemnified Party or assigned by the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified
Party) and (ii) (x) increased to take into account any net Tax cost incurred
by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt or accrual of indemnity
payments hereunder (grossed-up for such increase) and (y) reduced to take
account of any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from
the deductibility of any such Losses or Taxes. Any indemnification payment
hereunder shall initially be made without regard to clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence and shall be increased or reduced to reflect
any such net Tax cost (including gross-up) or net Tax benefit only after the
Indemnified Party has actually realized such cost or benefit. The amount of
any increase or reduction hereunder shall be adjusted as necessary to reflect
any final resolution with respect to the Indemnified Partys liability for
Taxes and,

 



59  if necessary, TDY or Buyer, as the case may be, shall make payments to the
other to reflect such adjustment. Except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, for Tax purposes. Each of the parties
shall notify the other parties if it receives notice that any Tax Authority
proposes to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as other than an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes. A party (and its
Affiliates) shall not be deemed to have suffered a "Loss" with respect to an
item to the extent such party was actually compensated therefor by reason of
an increase in the amount otherwise paid to it or a reduction in the amount
otherwise paid by it pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof.

 

(d) No Action or claim for Losses subject to indemnification under this
Section 8.4 with respect to a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement shall be brought or made
after the date on which such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
shall terminate pursuant to Section 8.3 hereof, regardless of when the facts
underlying such claim are first discovered; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
claim made after the Closing and prior to such termination date with
reasonable specificity by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party
shall survive (and be subject to indemnification) until it is finally and
fully resolved.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no indemnity may be
sought hereunder in respect of (i) any Losses to the extent such Liability was
taken into account in determining the Final Net Working Capital, or (ii) any
claim for breach of any representation or warranty of TDY if (A) such claim
is based on a fact or an event occurring prior to Closing (whether or not also
occurring prior to the date of this Agreement) and (B) such fact or event was
disclosed to Buyer prior to the Closing. For purposes of this Section 8.4(e),
the term "disclosed" shall be understood to include only (I) the disclosures
contained in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule and (II) information made
available to Buyer in the Data Room prior to 5pm (Eastern time) on September
12, 2013 in such a way as to make reasonably apparent its relevance or
applicability as a qualification or exception to a specific representation of
TDY.

 

(f) (i) Upon receipt by a Buyer Indemnified Party or TDY Indemnified Party
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice from a third party of any action,
suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment against such Indemnified Party
which might give rise to a claim for Losses under this Section 8.4, the
Indemnified Party (or TDY or Buyer on behalf of an Indemnified Party) shall
promptly give written notice thereof to the party from whom indemnification is
sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") setting forth, with reasonable
specificity, the nature of and facts underlying each particular claim
(including identification of all particular sections of this Agreement
pursuant to which indemnification is being sought), a copy of any
documentation received from the third party and an estimate of the Losses
relating thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notice
shall not eliminate the right to indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. For the avoidance of doubt, notice by the Indemnified
Party to the Indemnifying Party will not be made or include notification
(formal or informal, written or oral) to any other Person or Governmental
Authority, other than as specifically agreed 

 



60  in writing between the Parties or as may be required by applicable Law.
Except as specifically provided in Section 8.4(k), the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right, at its option, to assume the defense of, at its own
expense and by its own counsel, any such matter as to which the Indemnified
Party is seeking indemnification hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party shall,
in accordance with the preceding sentence, undertake to compromise or defend
any such asserted liability, it shall notify the Indemnified Party of its
intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall agree to cooperate fully
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise of, or
defense against, any such asserted liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such asserted liability without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld)
unless such settlement releases the Indemnified Party in connection with such
matter and provides relief consisting solely of money damages borne by the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding an election of the Indemnifying Party to
assume the defense of such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of
such action or proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable
fees, costs and expenses of one such separate counsel pursuant to the
preceding sentence in each jurisdiction (and shall pay such fees, costs and
expenses at least quarterly), if, but only if, (i) the defendants in, or
targets of, any such action or proceeding include both an Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded, based on the advice of counsel, that there is a material conflict
of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
with respect to such proceeding (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to direct the defense of such action or proceeding on
behalf of the Indemnified Party) or (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have
employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to
represent such Indemnified Party within a reasonable time after notice of the
institution of such action or proceeding. In any event, the Indemnified Party
and its counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
and shall not assert any position in any proceeding inconsistent with that
asserted by the Indemnifying Party.

 

(ii) Except as specifically provided in Section 8.4(k), if the Indemnifying
Party does not undertake to compromise or defend any Third Party Claim
pursuant to Section 8.4(f)(i) above, then the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to participate in any such defense at its sole cost and expense, but
in such case, the Indemnified Party shall control the investigation and
defense of the asserted liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall not consent to any settlement of a Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that the Indemnifying Party may, at its option, elect at any time
to assume and control the defense against such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Partys decision to allow the Indemnified Party to take the lead
with respect to any indemnity obligation of the Indemnifying Party shall not
limit, expand or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Partys obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to any such indemnity obligation,
and if an Indemnified Party settles a Third Party Claim it is defending
pursuant to this Section 8.4(f)(ii) without obtaining the Indemnifying Partys
written consent to such settlement in violation of the immediately preceding
sentence, then the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its
indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim.

 



61 (iii) In the event any Indemnified Party has an indemnification claim against
any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that does not involve a claim by
a third party, promptly after becoming aware of any facts or circumstances
which the Indemnified Party believes have given or would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a right of indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party in writing setting forth, with reasonable specificity, the
nature of and facts underlying each particular claim (including
identification of all particular sections of this Agreement pursuant to which
indemnification is being sought) and an estimate of the Losses relating
thereto. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party has been materially prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute shall be resolved by litigation in the appropriate court of competent
jurisdiction.

(g) The indemnification provisions of this Agreement (i) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy (other than (A) as set forth in Section 5.17(a)(ii) and
(B) injunctive relief or specific performance as contemplated by Section 9.7)
following the Closing with respect to the matters covered by this Agreement
or related to the Sale, including any breach or non-fulfillment of any
representation, warranty, agreement, covenant or any other obligation
contained in this Agreement or any Related Agreement, (ii) shall apply without
regard to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation by reason of set-off,
limitation or otherwise and (iii) are intended to be comprehensive and not to
be limited by any requirements of Law concerning prominence of language or
waiver of any legal right under any Law (including rights under any workers
compensation statute or similar statute conferring immunity from suit). In
furtherance of the foregoing, except for claims arising from fraud or
intentional misconduct, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of
action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have
against TDY or any of its Affiliates or Buyer or any of its Affiliates, as
the case may be, arising under or based upon any Law (including any such Law
relating to environmental matters (including Environmental Laws) or arising
under or based upon any securities Law, common Law or otherwise). The
obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 8.4 shall be conditioned
upon the Closing having occurred. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in no event shall any party, its successors or permitted assigns
be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Related Agreements. Without limiting the foregoing, but
subject to the terms of this Agreement, Buyer, for itself and its
Affiliates and on behalf of their respective successors and assigns, does
hereby irrevocably release, hold harmless and forever discharge TDY and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives from any and all Environmental
Claims resulting from or arising out of or in connection with the Tungsten
Materials

 



62  Assets or the Tungsten Materials Business other than claims arising from (i)
a breach of the representations or warranties set forth in Section 3.12, (ii)
the Retained Liabilities or (iii) fraud or intentional misconduct. In
furtherance of, but subject to, the foregoing, Buyer, for itself and on behalf
of its Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waives any and
all rights and benefits with respect to such Environmental Claims (other than
claims arising from fraud or intentional misconduct) that it now has, or in
the future may have conferred upon it by virtue of any Law or common law
principle, in each case, which provides that a general release does not
extend to claims which a party does not know or suspect to exist in its favor
at the time of executing the release, if knowledge of such claims would have
materially affected such partys settlement with the obligor. In
this connection, Buyer hereby acknowledges that it is aware that factual
matters now unknown to it and TDY or any of their respective Affiliates with
respect to environmental conditions at, on, in or underneath any Real Property
may have given, or hereafter may give, rise to Environmental Claims that have
not been made prior to the date of this Agreement or will not be made prior to
the Closing Date, and Buyer further agrees that the release set forth in this
Section 8.4 has been negotiated and agreed upon in light of that awareness,
and Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates and on behalf of their respective
successors and assigns, nevertheless hereby intends irrevocably to release,
hold harmless and forever discharge TDY and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives from all such Environmental Claims (other than
claims arising from fraud or intentional misconduct).

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, neither TDY nor
Buyer shall be required to provide indemnification for Losses (other than
with respect to claims for Losses based on breach of Fundamental
Representations or fraud or intentional misconduct) under Sections 8.4(a)(iii)
and 8.4(b)(iii) to the Buyer Indemnified Parties or TDY Indemnified Parties,
respectively, (i) for any individual item or series of related items where the
Loss relating thereto is less than Twenty-Five Thousand U.S. Dollars ($25,000)
(the " _De Minimis Claim Threshold_ ") or (ii) in respect of each individual
item where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than the De
Minimis Claim Threshold, unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or TDY Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, with respect to such breaches (in the aggregate), exceeds
$7,562,500 (the " _Basket_ "), in which case the obligation to provide
indemnification under Sections 8.4(a)(iii) and 8.4(b)(iii) to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or TDY Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall
only apply with respect to such amounts that are in excess of the Basket.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the maximum
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from TDY or
Buyer, respectively, arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in
Sections 8.4(a)(iii) and 8.4(b)(iii), as applicable, shall not exceed
$60,500,000 in the aggregate (other than with respect to claims for
Losses based on breach of Fundamental Representations or fraud or intentional
misconduct, which shall be limited to the Final Purchase Price).

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, for purposes of
this Section 8.4 only, the representations and warranties of TDY shall not be
deemed qualified by any reference to materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or
similar qualification.

 



63 (k) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
TDYs indemnity obligation pursuant to Section 8.4(a)(iii) with respect to
any breach of TDYs representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.12
shall be subject to the following limitations:

 

(A) if the cost of Cleanup or for correcting a non-compliance with the
Environmental Law subject to indemnity by TDY is increased after the Closing
due to an act by any Person other than TDY or its Affiliates or any of their
respective employees, agents, consultants or representatives, TDY shall not be
responsible for any such increase in costs incurred;

 

(B) TDY shall not be responsible for any capital improvements and repairs and
modifications to capital improvements associated with any property;

(C) TDY shall not be responsible for any costs, including costs of Cleanup and
for corrective actions, to the extent such costs are incurred due to (A) any
change in Environmental Laws occurring after the Closing Date; (B) any change
resulting or arising from the closure, sale, modification, excavation or
construction of, or at, the Real Property, except for any modification,
excavation or construction undertaken by Buyer in the ordinary course of
business; (C) any change in use of the facilities from manufacturing to any
other use; or (D) implementation of any Cleanup or corrective action that is
not conducted to achieve the least stringent applicable Remediation Standards
in the most effective and commercially reasonable manner; and

 

(D) TDY shall not be responsible for costs of Cleanup, corrective action or
other Losses arising out of or related to any investigation, compliance or
risk audit, assessment, study or other remedial or corrective action that any
Buyer Indemnified Party voluntarily initiates, performs or causes to be
performed by any Person or Governmental Authority (i.e., any investigation,
compliance or risk audit, assessment, study or other remedial or corrective
action that any Buyer Indemnified Party initiates, performs or causes to be
performed which is not required by any Environmental Law or first initiated
and required by a Governmental Authority).

(ii) With respect to any indemnity obligation of TDY pursuant to Section
8.4(a)(iii) for any breach of TDYs representations and warranties set forth
in Section 3.12, to the extent such indemnity obligation (1) relates to a
Third Party Claim, TDY shall have the right to defend, compromise and settle
any and all such Third Party Claims, and (2) relates to (i) the investigation
or Cleanup of any exposure to or Release

 



64  of Hazardous Substances or (ii) the investigation of or corrective action
for any potential or actual non-compliance with Environmental Laws, TDY shall
have the right to take the lead and implement any such investigation,
corrective action or Cleanup, which right shall include, without limitation,
access to the Real Property if necessary to undertake such work. Buyer may, at
its own expense, remain involved in the performance of any action respecting
clauses (1) and (2) of the preceding sentence (except to the extent that such
involvement would unreasonably interfere with the performance of the work),
and TDY shall promptly provide copies to Buyer of all
notices, correspondence, draft reports and final reports related to such
matter. However, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyers involvement as provided
in this paragraph shall not include communications or contact of any nature
whatsoever with any Person or Governmental Authority except as specifically
pre-approved in writing by TDY. No Cleanup by TDY shall include the use of any
remediation technique or method which imposes any unreasonable restrictions on
Buyers use of the Real Property for the Tungsten Materials Business unless
Buyer pre-approves such restriction in writing (such pre-approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). For purposes of the foregoing sentence,
"unreasonable restrictions" shall not include (A) restrictions on the use or
extraction of groundwater, (B) the placement or maintenance of engineered
barriers where floors, foundations or other manmade surfaces exist as of the
Closing, or (C) deed restrictions limiting the use of the Real Property to
commercial or industrial purposes. TDY shall undertake any such work required
herein in a manner designed to minimize any disruption, to the extent
reasonably practicable, with the conduct of operations at the Real
Property. Buyer shall agree to allow access to conduct any of the work
contemplated herein and shall fully cooperate with TDY in the performance of
the work.

 

(iii) If TDY declines to exercise its right to defend, compromise and settle
any Third Party Claim or to take the lead and implement any investigation,
corrective action or Cleanup under this Section 8.4(k), Buyer may (1) defend,
compromise and settle any such Third Party Claim, and (2) take the lead and
implement any such investigation, corrective action or Cleanup, and Buyer
shall allow TDY, at TDYs sole expense, to remain involved in the performance
of any action respecting clauses (1) and (2) above; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer shall not consent to any settlement of any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of TDY (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that
TDY may, at its option, elect at any time to assume and control the defense
against such Third Party Claim. TDYs decision to allow Buyer to take the lead
with respect to any indemnity obligation of TDY shall not limit, expand or
otherwise affect TDYs obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to any
such indemnity obligation of TDY. Buyer shall promptly provide copies to TDY
of all notices, correspondence, draft reports and final reports related to
such matter.

 

(iv) If Buyer or its Affiliates (1) settles any Third Party Claim, or (2)
initiates contact with any Governmental Authority (except in response to any
inquiry initiated by any Governmental Authority), in relation to any matter
that is or could be an indemnity obligation of TDY pursuant to Section
8.4(a)(iii) for any breach of TDYs representations and warranties set forth
in Section 3.12 without obtaining TDYs prior written consent (which consent
shall not be denied if the reporting is required by

 



65  applicable Environmental Law), then TDY shall be relieved of its
indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such matter, and Buyer
shall indemnify TDY for any Losses resulting from such settlement or
contract.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, TDY shall not
be required to provide indemnification for Losses under Section 8.4(a)(iv) to
the Buyer Indemnified Parties unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to Section 8.4(a)(iv)
(in the aggregate) exceeds $250,000, in which case the obligation to provide
indemnification under Section 8.4(a)(iv) to the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall only apply with respect to such amounts that are in excess of $250,000.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (A) the maximum
aggregate amount of Losses that may be recovered from TDY arising out of or
resulting from the causes enumerated in Section 8.4(a)(iv) shall not exceed
$13,000,000 in the aggregate, (B) TDY shall not be responsible for any Losses
or any other obligations incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any
Losses arising out of, or otherwise related to, the Thoriated Powder
Obligations and/or TDYs operation of the thoriated tungsten powder product
line at the Huntsville, Alabama facility on or after the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any claim made prior to such
fifth anniversary shall survive (and be subject to indemnification) until it
is fully and finally resolved, and (C) Section 8.4(a)(iv) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses arising
out of, or otherwise related to, the Thoriated Powder Obligations
and/or TDYs operation of the thoriated tungsten powder product line at the
Huntsville, Alabama facility (and the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to any other claims for Losses under Section 8.4 or otherwise,
including for a breach or alleged breach of the representation in Section
3.12, related to the Thoriated Powder Obligations and/or TDYs operation of
the thoriated tungsten powder product line at the Huntsville, Alabama
facility).

 

(m) In the event the Buyer has an indemnification claim against TDY under
Section 8.4(a)(iv), promptly after becoming aware of any facts or
circumstances which the Buyer believes have given or would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a right of indemnification pursuant to Section
8.4(a)(iv), the Buyer shall deliver reasonably prompt notice of such claim
to TDY in writing setting forth, with reasonable specificity, the nature of
and facts underlying each particular claim and an estimate of the Losses
relating thereto. With respect to any indemnity obligation of TDY pursuant to
Section 8.4(a)(iv), TDY shall have the right, upon notice to Buyer within 30
days of receipt of notice of a claim from Buyer, to take the lead and
implement any such investigation, corrective action or Cleanup in accordance
with applicable Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits, which right
shall include, without limitation, reasonable access to the Real Property
located at Huntsville, Alabama if necessary to undertake such work. TDY shall
comply with, and shall cause any third parties performing the work to comply
with, Buyers reasonable standard policies and procedures related to its
facilities and third party service providers. Buyer may, at its own expense,
remain involved in the performance of any action related to the
preceding sentence (except to the extent that such involvement would
unreasonably interfere with the performance of the work), and TDY shall
promptly provide copies to Buyer of all notices, correspondence, draft reports
and final reports related to such matter. TDY shall provide a monthly
accounting of any

 



66  work undertaken pursuant to any indemnification claim under Section
8.4(a)(ii) during any period such work is ongoing. TDY shall undertake any
such work required herein in a manner designed to minimize any disruption, to
the extent reasonably practicable, with the conduct of operations at the Real
Property and shall not undertake the work in a manner that adversely effects
Buyers use of the Real Property (other than as relates to the investigation,
corrective action or Cleanup of the Thoriated Powder Obligations and/or
Buyers operation of the thoriated tungsten powder product line at the
Huntsville, Alabama facility). Subject to Section 8.4(l), TDYs obligation
hereunder shall be considered satisfied with respect to any indemnification
claim hereunder when TDY receives and provides to Buyer a no further action
letter or its equivalent from the applicable Governmental Authority. Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with TDY in the performance of the work, but shall
be reimbursed by TDY for any expenditures incurred as a result of such
cooperation. If TDY declines to take the lead and implement any investigation,
corrective action or Cleanup under this Section 8.4(m), Buyer may take the
lead and implement any such investigation, corrective action or Cleanup, and
Buyer shall allow TDY, at TDYs sole expense, to remain involved in the
performance of any action;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not
consent to any settlement, if applicable, without the prior written consent of
TDY (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed);. TDYs decision to allow Buyer to take the lead with respect to any
indemnity obligation of TDY shall not limit, expand or otherwise affect TDYs
obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to any such indemnity obligation of
TDY. Buyer shall promptly provide copies to TDY of all notices,
correspondence, draft reports and final reports related to such matter.

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

 

Section 9.7 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage may occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or in
equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of injunctive
relief, specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the
parties hereto hereby waives (a) any defenses in any action for specific
performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

Section 9.8 _Publicity_. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees with the other party hereto that no press release or similar public
announcement or communication shall, if prior to, or after, the Closing, be
made or be caused to be made (including by such parties respective
Affiliates) concerning the execution or performance of this Agreement unless
the parties shall have agreed in advance with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Section 9.8 shall terminate and the parties shall have
no further obligations with respect to the subject matter hereunder upon the
earlier of (a) one (1) month after the date of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 or (b) such earlier date that TDY or any of
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing (i) either party may make or
cause to be made any press release or similar public announcement or
communication as may be required to comply with the requirements of any
applicable Laws (including the Exchange Act) or the rules and regulations of
each stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties is listed
and (ii) either party may disclose any information concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby which it deems appropriate in its reasonable judgment, in
light of such partys status as a publicly owned company, including
to securities analysts and institutional investors and in press interviews;
_provided_ , that in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above to the extent in
the good faith judgment of such party it is reasonably practicable to do so,
such party (x) provides the other party with a reasonable opportunity in
light of the circumstances to review such partys intended communication and
(y) consider in good faith modifications to the intended communication that
are requested by the other party. Subject to the other terms of this
Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate to develop a mutually agreeable post-
signing communications plan regarding customers, suppliers, employees and

hereto further agree that the parties will not bring suit with respect to any
disputes arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any court or jurisdiction other than the above specified courts; _provided_
, _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit (i) TDYs or any of its
Affiliates ability or right to join, implead or otherwise bring any third-
party claim against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in an action brought
against TDY or any of its Affiliates by a third party in a jurisdiction
outside of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Buyer agrees that, pursuant
to Section 9.9(b), it (and its Subsidiaries, as applicable) will submit to
such jurisdiction or (ii) Buyers or any of its Subsidiaries ability or right
to join, implead or otherwise bring any third-party claim against TDY or any
of its Affiliates in an action brought against Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries by a third party in a jurisdiction outside of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and TDY agrees that, pursuant to Section 9.9(b), it (and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable) will submit to such jurisdiction. The parties
hereto further agree, to the extent permitted by law, that final and
unappealable judgment against a party in any action or proceeding
contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a
certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such judgment.

(b) To the extent that any party hereto has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each such party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement, and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in Section 9.9(a).

ANY ACTION HEREUNDER.

Section 9.10 _Conflicts; Privileges_. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties that TDY and ATI and certain of its Subsidiaries have retained KandL
Gates LLP to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that KandL Gates LLP has not acted as counsel for any
other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that
no other Party or Person has the status of a client of KandL Gates LLP for
conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Buyer hereby
agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or any of its
Affiliates and ATI or any of its Affiliates, KandL Gates LLP may represent ATI
or any such Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of ATI or such
Affiliate may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any Transferred Subsidiary) and even though KandL Gates LLP may have
represented the Tungsten Materials Business or a Transferred Subsidiary in a
matter substantially related to such dispute, 

 



70  and Buyer hereby waives, on behalf of themselves and each of its Affiliates,
any conflict of interest in connection with such representation by KandL Gates
LLP. Buyer further agrees that, as to all communications, whether written or
electronic, among KandL Gates, ATI, TDY and the Transferred Subsidiaries, and
all files, attorney notes, drafts or other documents, that relate in any way
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that predate the
Closing, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence
and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to ATI (or TDY, as
appropriate) and may be controlled by ATI (or TDY, as appropriate) and shall
not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Tungsten Materials Business or any

to cause its respective Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement
the intent of this Section 9.10.

the parties, any number of counterparts hereof may be executed, each such
executed counterpart shall be deemed an original and all such counterparts
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile transmission

incurring such expenses.

Section 9.15 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and

specific representation or warranty shall be deemed to be "reflected on,"
"set forth in" or "given effect in numbers on" a balance sheet or financial
statement, to the extent any such phrase appears in such representation
or warranty, to the extent that (a) there is a reserve, accrual or other
similar item underlying a number on the face of such balance sheet or
financial statement that specifically relates to the subject matter of such
representation or (b) such item is otherwise set forth with specificity on
the face of such balance sheet or financial statement or in the notes thereto.

that are made as of a specific date or dates, references to any statute shall
be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date). If
the Closing shall occur, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any payment obligation of Buyer hereunder shall be a joint and
several obligation of Buyer and its Subsidiaries.
