AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this
"Agreement") dated as of August 17, 2000 by and among American International
Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Engine Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), and HSB Group, Inc., a Connecticut corporation (the
"Company").   WHEREAS, Parent and the Company have determined that it would
be in their respective best interests and in the interests of their
respective stockholders to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;   WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of
Directors of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub have approved the merger of
the Company with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement;   WHEREAS, for federal income
tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qua1ify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement is intended to be
and is adopted as a plan of reorganization;   WHEREAS, contemporaneously
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and
inducement to Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the Company is entering into a stock option agreement with Parent
(the "Stock Option Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company has granted to
Parent an option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (as defined in
Section 1.2) under the terms and conditions set forth in the Stock Option
Agreement;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the
mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein
contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:     ARTICLE 1   PLAN OF
MERGER  1.1 The Merger   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined herein) and in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Connecticut Business
Corporation Act (the "CBCA") and the Delaware General Corporation Law
("DGCL"), the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger
Sub as the surviving corporation (sometimes referred to hereinafter as the
"Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and the separate corporate existence
of the Company shall cease. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a
certificate of merger complying with Section 33-819 of the CBCA shall be duly
prepared, executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Connecticut as provided in the CBCA (the "Connecticut Certificate of Merger")
and a certificate of merger complying with Section 252 of the DGCL shall be
duly prepared, executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State
of Delaware as provided in the DGCL (the "Delaware Certificate of Merger"),
in each case on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2.1). The Merger
shall become effective on the date and at the time at which the last of the
following actions shall have been completed: (i) the Connecticut Certificate
of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of Connecticut and
(ii) the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware (the "Effective Time").   (b) From and after
the Effective Time, the Merger shall have all the effects set forth in the
CBCA and the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, by virtue of the Merger and in accordance with the CBCA and
the DGCL, all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all of
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   (c) The
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and the DGCL; provided that such Certificate of
Incorporation shall be amended to change the name of the Surviving
Corporation to the name of the Company.     (d) The by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the by-laws of Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time until altered, amended or repealed as
provided therein or in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and the DGCL, provided that such by-laws shall be amended to
change the name of the Surviving Corporation to the name of the Company.  
(e) The officers of the Company and the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, respectively, shall be the initial
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation, respectively, until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.   1.2 . As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder thereof:   (a) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and
the Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.  
(b) All shares of common stock, no par value per share, of the
Company ("Company Common Stock"), including each attached right (a "Company
Right") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of November 28, 1998
between the Company and BankBoston, N.A. (the "Company Rights Agreement"),
that are owned by the Company or by any direct or indirect subsidiary of the
Company (other than shares held in the investment portfolio of a direct or
indirect subsidiary of the Company) and any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of
Parent (other than shares held in the investment portfolio of a direct or
indirect subsidiary of Parent) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.     (c) Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any
attached Company Right (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
1.2(e)) and shares of Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with
Section 1.2(b)), shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for, that
portion of a share of Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share, of Parent
("Parent Common Stock") equal to the lesser of (i)  .4683 (the "Maximum
Exchange Ratio") and (ii) the amount (the "Closing Price Exchange Ratio")
derived by dividing $41.00 by the average of the closing prices per share of
Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE composite transactions reporting
system (as reported in the New York City edition of The Wall Street Journal)
for each of the 10 consecutive trading days in the period ending five trading
days prior to the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2.1) (the "Base Period
Stock Price"); provided, however, if the Maximum Exchange Ratio is less than
the Closing Price Exchange Ratio, Parent shall elect either (i) in
addition to the issuance of a portion of a share of Parent Company Common
Stock equal to the Maximum Exchange Ratio, to pay a cash amount equal to the
Per Share Cash Top-Up Amount or (ii) (x) to increase the Maximum Exchange
Ratio (the "Adjusted Maximum Exchange Ratio") such that the product of the
Adjusted Maximum Exchange Ratio times the Base Period Stock Price (the
"Product") equals or is less than $41.00 and (y) if the Product is less than
$41.00 pay a cash amount equal to the difference between $41.00 and such
Product. The portion of a share of Parent Common Stock exchanged and, if
applicable, the cash amount paid for each share of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Section 1.2(c) shall be referred to as the "Merger
Consideration".   For purposes of this Section 1.2(c) "Per Share Cash Top-
Up Amount" means the greater of (i) $0 and (ii) (x) $41.00 minus (y) the
product of (A) the Base Period Stock Price and (B) the Maximum Exchange
Ratio. Prior to the Closing, Parent will notify the Exchange Agent, if
applicable, of the Adjusted Maximum Exchange Ratio and any Per Share Cash
Top-Up Amount or the Closing Price Exchange Ratio.   (d) In the event that,
subsequent to the date hereof but prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock,
respectively, shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class as a result of a stock-split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall
be appropriately adjusted to provide holders of Company Common Stock with the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement.   (e) Each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock, including any attached Company
Right, the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent
under applicable Law (as defined in Section 3.15(b)) and has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by applicable Law; provided, however, that any
Dissenting Share held by a person at the Effective Time who shall, after the
Effective Time, withdraw the demand for payment for shares or lose the right
to payment for shares, in either case pursuant to the CBCA, shall be deemed
to be converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.2(c). The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice upon receipt by the Company of any such written demands for
payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock and of
attempted withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided
pursuant to applicable Law and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the
CBCA. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the
Surviving Corporation. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands. (1)    1.3 Exchange of Certificates  
(a) From time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall when and
as required make available to a bank or trust company designated by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this Article 1 through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash,
if any, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
made available by Parent in accordance with this Section 1.3, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). Certificates (as defined
herein) shall be surrendered and exchanged as follows:   (i) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the  Exchange Agent will
mail to each holder of record of a certificate  representing shares of
Company Common Stock (a "Certificate"), whose shares  of Company Common Stock
were converted into the right to receive Merger  Consideration, (x) a letter
of transmittal (which will specify that  delivery will be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates  will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and  will be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the  Company may specify consistent with this
Agreement) and (y) instructions  for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the  Merger Consideration and any unpaid
dividends and other distributions.     (ii) At the Effective Time, and
upon surrender in accordance with  Section 1.3(a)(i) of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent  or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent and the  Company, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such  other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the  holder of such Certificate will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor  the Merger Consideration and any
unpaid dividends or other distributions  that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of  this Article 1, and the Certificate so
surrendered will forthwith be  canceled. No interest will be paid or accrue
on any amount payable upon due  surrender of the Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of  shares of Company Common Stock that are not
registered in the transfer  records of the Company, payment may be issued to
a person other than the  person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered if such  Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer  and the person requesting such issuance pays any
transfer or other Taxes  (as defined in Section 3.9) required by reason of
such payment to a person  other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establishes to the  satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not  applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.3, each  Certificate (other than a Certificate
representing shares of Company Common  Stock to be canceled in accordance
with Section 1.2(b) and other than  Dissenting Shares) will be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to  represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger  Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions that the  holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of
such Certificate  pursuant to the provisions of this Article 1.   (b) No
certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights as a stockholder of Parent. All fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock that a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated, and, if a
fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled
to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash (without interest) determined
by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Base Period Stock Price. No such cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder
of Company Common Stock until Certificates are surrendered and exchanged in
accordance with Section 1.3(a).   (c) The Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article 1 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to any obligation of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been authorized or made with respect to shares of Company Common Stock which
remain unpaid or unsatisfied at the Effective Time, and there shall be no
further registration from and after the Effective Time of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 1.3, except as otherwise provided by
applicable Law.     1.4 Dividends. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of
the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared
by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is
at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or
other distributions in respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions that are
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock
payable to holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be paid
to a Company stockholder entitled to receive certificates representing Parent
Common Stock until such stockholder has properly surrendered such
stockholders\' Certificates. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to the
stockholder in whose name the certificates representing such Parent Common
Stock shall be issued any dividends with a record date at or after the
Effective Time which shall have become payable with respect to such Parent
Common Stock between the Effective Time and the time of such
surrender, without interest. After such surrender, there shall also be paid
to the stockholder in whose name the certificates representing such Parent
Common Stock shall be issued any dividend on such Parent Common Stock that
shall have a record date subsequent to the Effective Time and prior to such
surrender and a payment date after such surrender; provided that such
dividend payments shall be made on such payment dates. In no event shall the
stockholders entitled to receive such dividends be entitled to receive
interest on such dividends.   1.5 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion
of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have
not theretofore complied with this Article 1 shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for any Merger Consideration and, if
applicable, any unpaid dividends or other distributions which such holder may
be due, subject to applicable Law. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person (as defined herein) in
respect of any such shares of Parent Common Stock or funds from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. As used in this Agreement, "Person" shall
mean any natural person, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, trust, association or entity of
any kind.   1.6 Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent will invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to Parent.  
1.7 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting of a reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends
or distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect
thereof, in each case pursuant to this Agreement.      1.8 Withholding
Rights. The Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, such amounts withheld shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent as
the case may be.    ARTICLE 2   CLOSING   2.1 Time and Place of
Closing. Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by Parent and the
Company, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will be held at 10:00
a.m., local time, on the first business day following the date that all of
the conditions precedent specified in Article VI (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied or waived by
the party or parties permitted to do so (such date being referred
to hereinafter as the "Closing Date"). The place of Closing shall be at the
offices of Sullivan and Cromwell, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York, or at
such other place as may be agreed between Parent and the Company.   
ARTICLE 3   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as
disclosed in the Company\'s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999,
or the Company\'s Form 10-Qs and Form 8-Ks filed since December 31, 1999 and
prior to the date hereof or as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered
to Parent concurrent with the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Letter"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:   3.1 Organization, Good Standing and Power    
(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Connecticut and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties make such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing is
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company (as defined herein). The Company has delivered
to Parent complete and correct copies of its Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation ("Certificate of Incorporation") and its By-Laws, as amended
to the date hereof. As used in this Agreement, the phrase "Material Adverse
Effect on the Company" means a material adverse effect on the condition
(financial or otherwise), properties, business, or results of the operations
of the Company and its subsidiaries (as defined below) taken as a whole,
other than (i) effects caused by changes in general economic or securities
markets conditions, (ii) changes or conditions that affect the U.S. property-
casualty insurance industry in general, (iii) changes in generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied ("GAAP") or statutory accounting
practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable insurance regulatory
authority and (iv) effects resulting from the announcement of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.   For purposes of this Agreement;
the term "Responsible Executive Officers" shall mean the persons designated
as such in Schedule 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter. As used in this
Agreement, the term "subsidiary" of a party shall mean any corporation or
other entity (including joint ventures, partnerships and other business
associations) in which such party directly or indirectly owns outstanding
capital stock or other voting securities having the power to elect a majority
of the directors or similar members of the governing body of such corporation
or other entity, or otherwise direct the management and policies of such
corporation or other entity.   (b) Each subsidiary of the Company (a
"Company Subsidiary") is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has
the corporate or other power and authority necessary for it to own or lease
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing or to have such power and authority is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing is not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and any by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents for each Company Subsidiary).     (c)
Joint Ventures. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to
or member of, or otherwise holds, any Joint Venture. With respect to the
joint ventures of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are not Joint
Ventures (A) except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is liable for any
material obligations or material liabilities of any such joint ventures,
(B) except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is obligated to make any loans
or capital contributions to, or to undertake any guarantees or obligations
with respect to, such joint ventures, (C) none of such joint ventures own any
assets that are material to the continued conduct of the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, substantially as it
is presently conducted, (D) except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
subject to any material limitation on its right to compete or any material
limitation on its right to otherwise conduct business by reason of any
agreement relating to such joint venture and (E) to the knowledge of the
Responsible Executive Officers after due inquiry, each joint venture is in
material compliance with all Laws of all Governmental Entities. As used
herein, "Joint Venture" shall mean those direct or indirect joint ventures of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (i) that are not otherwise a direct or
indirect Company Subsidiary and (ii) in which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement have invested, or made
commitments to invest, $25 million or more, but "Joint Venture" and
"joint venture" shall not include any entities whose securities are held
solely for passive investment purposes by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Schedule 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains, as of
the date of this Agreement, a correct and complete list of each joint venture
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is not a Joint Venture.   (d)
The Company conducts its insurance operations through the subsidiaries set
forth on Schedule 3.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (collectively,
the "Company Insurance Subsidiaries"). Each of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries is (i) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company and,
where applicable, a reinsurance company, in its jurisdiction of
incorporation, (ii) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company and,
where applicable, a reinsurance company, in each other jurisdiction where it
is required to be so licensed or authorized and (iii) duly authorized in its
jurisdiction of incorporation and each other applicable jurisdiction to write
each line of business reported as being written in the Company SAP Statements
(as defined in Section 3.7(a)), except, in any such case, where the failure
to be so licensed or authorized is not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or to
prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has
made all required filings under applicable insurance holding company
statutes, except where the failure to file is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on

reports and reports on Form 8-K and other forms, reports, schedules and
documents, if any, filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 1998
and prior to the date hereof (as such documents have been amended since the
time of their filing, collectively, the "Company Reports"). As of their
respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment,
the Company Reports (i) were timely filed and complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as

of the Company included in the Company Reports complied, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles (except, in the case of
unaudited consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may

respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended

adjustments). Except for those obligations and liabilities that are reflected
or reserved against on the balance sheet included in the Company\'s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999 or in the footnotes
to the financial statements included therein, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature
whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, known, unknown
or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations incurred since December
31, 1999 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or to prevent, materially hinder or
materially delay the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.      3.7 Statutory Statements   (a)
The Company has previously furnished or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of the annual statements or other comparable statements
for each of the years ended December 31, 1997, December 31, 1998, and
December 31, 1999, and for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2000 and
June 30, 2000, together with all exhibits and schedules thereto
(collectively, the "Company SAP Statements"), with respect to each of the
Company Insurance Subsidiaries, in each case as filed with the Governmental
Authority charged with supervision of insurance companies of such Company
Insurance Subsidiary\'s jurisdiction of domicile. The Company SAP Statements
were prepared in conformity with statutory or other applicable accounting
practices prescribed or permitted by such Governmental Authority applied on a
consistent basis ("SAP") and present fairly, to the extent required by and in
conformity with SAP in all material respects the statutory financial
condition of such Company Insurance Subsidiary (in the case of domestic U.S.
Company Insurance Subsidiaries) or applicable regulatory financial condition
(in the case of non-U.S. Company Insurance Subsidiaries) at their respective
dates and the results of operations, changes in capital and surplus and cash
flow of such Company Insurance Subsidiary for each of the periods then ended.
No deficiencies or violations material to the financial condition of any of
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries, individually, whether or not material in
the aggregate, have been asserted in writing by any Governmental Authority
which have not been cured or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of such
Governmental Authority (unless not currently pending). The Company has
made available to Parent true and complete copies of all financial
examination and other reports of Governmental Authorities, including the most
recent reports of state insurance regulatory authorities, relating to each
Company Insurance Subsidiary. The quarterly statements of each Company
Insurance Subsidiary for the quarter ending March 31, 2000 as filed and the
quarterly statements of each Company Insurance Subsidiary thereafter filed
prior to the Closing, when filed with the Governmental Authorities, including
insurance regulatory authorities, of the applicable jurisdictions, presented
and will present fairly, to the extent required by and in conformity with SAP
in all material respects the statutory financial condition of such Company
Insurance Subsidiary (in the case of domestic U.S. Company Insurance
Subsidiaries) or applicable regulatory financial condition (in the case of
non-U.S. Company Insurance Subsidiaries) at their respective dates indicated
and the results of operations, changes in capital and surplus and cash flow
of such Company Insurance Subsidiary for each of the periods therein
specified (subject to normal year-end adjustments).    (b) All reserves for
claims, losses (including, without limitation, incurred but not reported
losses) and loss adjustment expenses, (whether allocated or unallocated) as
reflected in the Company SAP Statements, were determined in accordance with
SAP, consistently applied, and made reasonable provision in the aggregate to
cover the total amount of liabilities under all outstanding policies and
contracts of insurance, reinsurance and retrocession as of the dates of such
statutory statements except for any deficiency which is not reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or to prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the ability of
the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each Company Insurance Subsidiary owns assets that qualify as admitted assets
under applicable Insurance Laws in an amount at least equal to any such
required reserves plus its minimum statutory capital and surplus as required
under applicable Insurance Laws. No Company Insurance Subsidiary\'s reserves
have been discounted on either a tabular or non-tabular basis.   3.8 Absence

per quarter, (iii) any split, combination or reclassification of any of the
Company\'s outstanding capital stock or any issuance or the authorization of

are identified in the Company Disclosure Letter, or (z) any entry by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary into any new severance or termination
agreement with any such executive officer or other employee, (v) any material
addition, or any development involving a prospective material addition, to

assumptions or principles of any Company Subsidiary with respect to
underwriting, pricing, reserving, claims administration or

Company;   (c) No federal, state, local or foreign audits, investigations or
other administrative proceedings or court proceedings are presently pending

in the aggregate is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company;    (d) The federal income tax returns of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") (or the applicable statutes of limitation for the assessment of
federal income taxes for such periods have expired) for all periods through
and including December 31, 1995, and no material deficiencies for any Taxes
were proposed, assessed or asserted as a result of such examinations that
have not been resolved and fully paid. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has granted any requests, agreements, consents or

There are no Tax liens upon any asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary except liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, liens

Material Adverse Effect on the Company or liens which otherwise are being

authority relating to Taxes. "Closing Agreement," as used in this Agreement,
shall mean a written and legally binding agreement with a taxing authority
relating to Taxes;   (h) All transactions that could give rise to an

Except as set forth in Schedule 3.9(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter, any
amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or benefit plan of the Company or a Company Subsidiary currently
in effect would not be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as
such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). In addition, except
as set forth in Schedule 3.9(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter, Section
162(m) of the Code will not apply to any amount paid or payable by the

prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There is no
outstanding order, writ, judgment, stipulation, injunction, decree,
determination, award or other decision against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary which is, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or to prevent, materially
hinder or materially delay the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the reasonable judgment
of the Responsible Executive Officers the aggregate case reserves maintained
by the Company and its Subsidiaries for cases in litigation are adequate to
cover the reasonably likely expenses of the Company and its subsidiaries with
respect to such cases based on the facts currently known by the Company,
provided, however, that this representation shall not be deemed to be a
representation as to the adequacy of reserves under outstanding policies and
contracts of insurance, reinsurance and retrocession in the aggregate.

or arrangements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are required

Material Adverse Effect on the Company or to prevent, materially hinder or
materially delay the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.11 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries is party to any contract, agreement or arrangement containing
any provision or covenant limiting in any manner the ability of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to (a) sell any products or services of or to any

thereto, at the time of the Stockholders\' Meeting, cause the Proxy Statement
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto to contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All
documents that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC and any
other regulatory agency in connection with the Merger will comply as to
substance and form in all material respects with the provisions of applicable
Law, except that no representation is made by the Company with respect to
statements made therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of

such Plan. The Company has identified those Company Employee Plans which the
Company intends to satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and
has made available to Parent accurate copies of the most recent favorable
determination letters for such plans.     (b) No liability under Title IV
or Section 302 of ERISA that is reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company has been incurred by the Company or
any entity (each, an "ERISA Affiliate") which together with the Company would
be deemed to be a "single employer" with the Company within the meaning of
Section 4001 of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition
exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of
incurring any such liability.   (c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has at any time within the last six years contributed or had any
obligation to contribute to a "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA, and no Company Employee Plan is a plan described in Section
4063(a) of ERISA. All contributions required to be made under the terms of
any Company Employee Plan have been timely made or have been reflected on the
Company SAP Statements. Under each Company Employee Plan that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, as of the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the
meaning of Section 4001(1)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in the Plan\'s most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Plan,
and there has been no material change in the financial condition of such Plan
since the last day of the most recent plan year. There has been no amendment
to, announcement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to, or
change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan
which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Plan above
the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent
fiscal year.   (d) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.13(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
obligated to provide post-employment or retirement medical benefits or any
other unfunded welfare benefits to or on behalf of any Person who is no
longer an employee of Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for health
continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA. In respect of any Company Employee Plan set forth on
Schedule 3.13(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter pursuant to the preceding
sentence, other than the Employee Agreements listed therein, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary may amend or terminate such Plan at any time without
incurring any liability thereunder except for benefits incurred through such
amendment or termination date.     (e) Neither the Company nor any other
"disqualified person" or "party in interest" (as defined in Section
4975(e)(2) of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively) has engaged
in any transaction in connection with any Company Employee Plan that could
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a penalty pursuant to
Section 502(i) of ERISA, damages pursuant to Section 409 of ERISA or a Tax
pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code which are, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Company
Employee Plan subject to the requirements of Section 601 of ERISA has been
operated in substantial compliance therewith. The Company has not contributed
to a "nonconforming group health plan" (as defined in Section 4000(c) of the
Code).   (f) Each Company Employee Plan has at all times been maintained, by
its terms and in operation, in substantial compliance with all applicable
Laws, and each of those Company Employee Plans which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has at all
times been maintained, by its terms and in operation, in accordance with
Section 401(a) of the Code.   (g) Schedule 3.13(g) of the Company Disclosure
Letter contains a true and complete summary or list of all material
employment contracts and other arrangements or agreements (including Company
Employee Plans) that contain "change in control" arrangements or other
provisions pursuant to which benefits or protections are triggered as a
result of transactions affecting the ownership of the Company or the
composition of its Board of Directors.   (h) There are no pending, or, to
the knowledge of the Responsible Executive Officers, threatened or
anticipated, claims that are, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect by or on behalf of any Company
Employee Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Plan, or
otherwise involving any Company Employee Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits).   (i) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.13(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the execution of or performance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether alone or in conjunction with a
termination of employment, will not create, (A) accelerate or increase any
obligations under any Company Employee Plan, (B) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust
or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or trigger any other
material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Employee Plans, (C)
result in any breach or violation of, or default under, any of the Company
Employee Plans or (D) require the Company (or after the Merger, Parent) to
recognize any compensation expense, or to change the basis on which
compensation expense is charged, in respect of any outstanding stock option
or other equity-based award.     (j) The trust agreement between the
Company and Fleet National Bank dated January 29, 1988, amended and restated
as of May 30, 1997 and further amended as of October 28, 1998 (the "Trust"),
has been amended effective as of August 16, 2000 to provide that the
execution of this Agreement shall not constitute a "Potential Change in
Control" (as defined in the Trust) of the Company and the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated by this agreement shall not constitute a
charge in control of the Company.   3.14 Collective Bargaining; Labor
Disputes; Compliance. There are no collective bargaining agreements to which
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or under which it
is bound. The employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are not

subject of any union organizing drive. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries is currently, nor has been during the past five years,
the subject of any strike, dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, slow down or
lockout involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of the Responsible Executive Officers after due inquiry, is any
such activity threatened. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has
substantially complied with all Laws relating to the employment and safety of
labor, including the National Labor Relations Act and other provisions
relating to wages, hours, benefits, collective bargaining and all applicable
occupational safety and health acts and Laws. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has engaged in any unfair labor practice or discriminated
on the basis of race, age, sex, disability or otherwise in its employment
conditions or practices with respect to its employees in a manner which is,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No action, suit, complaint, charge,
grievance, arbitration, employee proceeding or investigation by or before any
court, governmental entity, administrative agency or commission, brought by
or on behalf of any employee, prospective employee, former employee, retired
employee, labor organization or other representative of the Company\'s
employees is pending or, to the knowledge of the Responsible Executive
Officers after due inquiry, threatened against the Company except as
disclosed in Schedule 3.14 to the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company is
not a party to or otherwise bound by any consent decree with or citation by
any government entity relating to the Company\'s employees or employment
practices relating to the Company\'s employees. The Company is in compliance
with its obligations with respect to the Company\'s employees pursuant to the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, and all other
notification and bargaining obligations arising under any collective
bargaining agreement, statute or otherwise.   3.15 No Violation of
Law     (a) The business and operations of the Company, and the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries, have been conducted in compliance with all applicable
domestic and foreign statutes, regulations and rules regulating the business
and products of insurance and reinsurance and all applicable orders and
directives of insurance regulatory authorities and market conduct
recommendations resulting from market conduct examinations by insurance
regulatory authorities (collectively, "Insurance Laws"), except where the
failure to so conduct such business and operations is not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or to prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the ability of
the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, each Company Insurance
Subsidiary and its agents (including, to the knowledge of the Responsible
Executive Officers, any fronting company or anyone acting as agent in selling
insurance products on the Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s behalf)
have marketed, sold and issued insurance products in compliance in
all material respects with all Laws applicable to the business of such
Company Insurance Subsidiary and in the respective jurisdictions in which
such products have been sold, including, without limitation, in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable prohibitions against "redlining" or
withdrawal of business lines. In addition (i) there is no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Responsible Executive Officers, threatened charge by any
insurance regulatory authority that any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries
has violated, nor any pending or, to the knowledge of the Responsible
Executive Officers, threatened investigation by any insurance regulatory
authority with respect to possible violations of, any applicable Insurance
Laws where such violations are, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or to prevent,
materially hinder or materially delay the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) none of
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order or
decree of any insurance regulatory authority relating specifically to such

materially delay the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.      (b) In addition to Insurance Laws,

the Company or to prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the ability
of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In addition to Insurance Laws: (i) neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has been charged with or, to the knowledge of the Responsible
Executive Officers is now under investigation with respect to, a violation of
any applicable Law of a Governmental Authority or other regulatory body,
which violations or penalties are reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or to
prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any order,
judgment, decree or award of a Governmental Authority or other regulatory

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement

the request of any Governmental Authority that restricts in any material
respect the conduct of its business or that in any manner relates to its
capital adequacy, its credit policies, its management or its business (each,
a "Regulatory Agreement"), nor has the Company or any of the Company

Executive Officers, verbally, since January 1, 1998 by any Governmental
Authority that it is considering issuing or requesting any such Regulatory
Agreement; and (iv) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have filed all
reports required to be filed with any Governmental Authority on or before the
date hereof as to which the failure to file such reports is reasonably likely

of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

licenses, approvals and other authorizations required in connection with the
operation of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except
for permits, certificates, licenses, approvals and other authorizations the

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.22(b) to the

Subsidiary or imposed conditions (financial or otherwise) on retaining any
currently held rating assigned to any Company Insurance Subsidiary which is
rated as of the date of this Agreement, and the Company has no reason (other

or as amended or supplemented, and no deficiencies have been asserted in
writing by any such Governmental Authority with respect to such reports,
registrations, filings or submissions that have not been remedied, except for

complete copies of each report dated after January 1, 1998 (or the most
recent draft thereof, to the extent any final report is not available)
reflecting the results of any financial examinations or market-conduct
examinations of any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries conducted by any
Governmental Authority.        3.23 Investment Company. Neither the

satisfying the condition contained in Section 6.3(l), or (z) any activities
in connection with the proposed disposition of Integrated Process

in good faith, following consultation with and taking into account the advice
of outside counsel and its financial advisor, that it is necessary to do so
in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable
law, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) withdraw or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by such Board
of Directors of this Agreement or the Merger, or (ii) approve, recommend or
cause the Company to enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. If the Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with and taking into account the advice of its financial

Directors may (w) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger, (x) approve or recommend such Superior Proposal or
(y) cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any
action by or on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company permitted by
this Section 5.4 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.        5.5 Certain Fees. In the event that (i) an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
any of its stockholders or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal and
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(v) or Section 7.1(c)(iv) or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iv) or (y) by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) (only in the case of termination due to
willful or intentional breach), Section 7.1(c)(v) or Section 7.1(c)(vi), then
the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after the
date of such termination, pay Parent a termination fee of $45 million and
shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after being notified of
such by Parent, pay or reimburse all of the reasonable out-of-pocket charges
and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, incurred by Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock Option
Agreement up to a maximum amount of $5 million (the "Parent Expenses"), in
each case payable by wire transfer of same day funds or (iii) Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) other than due to
willful or intentional breaches, then the Company shall promptly, but in
no event later than two days after being notified of such termination by
Parent, pay to Parent the Parent Expenses; provided, however, that no fee
shall be payable to Parent pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 5.5 unless
and until (I) any Person (other than Parent) (an "Acquiring Party") has
acquired, by purchase, merger, consolidation, sale, assignment, lease,
transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or any related series of
transactions within 15 months of such termination, a majority of the voting

all of the assets of the Company or (II) the Company or one of its
subsidiaries and an Acquiring Party have entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to a merger, consolidation or similar business combination
within 15 months of such termination. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 5.5 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to this Section 5.5, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company
for the fee set forth in this Section 5.5, the Company shall pay to Parent or
Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.   5.6 Takeover Statutes. If any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination,"
"stockholder protection," "interested shareholder" or other similar
antitakeover statute or regulation enacted under state or federal Law shall
become applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby and the Stock Option Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and the
Board of Directors of each of the Company and Parent shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and the Stock Option Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise use reasonable efforts to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.        5.7 Consents. Each of the Company and Parent will
cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain the written consent or approval of each and every Governmental
Authority and other regulatory body, the consent or approval of which shall
be required in order to permit Parent, Merger Sub and the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will
use reasonable best efforts to obtain the written consent or approval, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, of each Person whose
consent or approval shall be required in order to permit Parent, Merger Sub

Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.7 shall require,
or be construed to require, Parent in connection with the receipt of any
regulatory approval, to proffer to, or agree to any conditions relating
to the Company or Parent, in either case, imposed by or in connection with
such consents on the operations of any asset or businesses of the parties
which is reasonably likely to materially and adversely impact the economic or
business benefits to Parent and its subsidiaries of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   5.8 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto will promptly file and
prosecute diligently the applications and related documents required to be

of the applicable waiting period and filings with Insurance Authorities. Each
party hereto agrees to cooperate with each other and to use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be

or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or the Stock Option
Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each corporation which is a
party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action. Each of the
parties hereto agrees to defend vigorously against any actions, suits or
proceedings in which such party is named as defendant which seeks to enjoin,
restrain or prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages
with respect to such transactions.   The Company and Parent shall promptly
advise each other upon receiving any communication from any third party or
Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is required for consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Stock Option
Agreement. The Company and Parent shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions to any
third party or Governmental Authority. The Company and the Parent shall
provide the other with a draft copy before submission and as-filed copies of
all filings and submissions with third parties and Governmental Authorities
and shall provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to comment upon all
such draft copies. The Company and Parent agree that, to the extent permitted
and feasible and reasonable, all meetings with any third party
or Governmental Authority (whether in person, by telephone or other means
of instantaneous communication) regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby shall include representatives of the Company and Parent unless such
parties jointly decide otherwise.    The Company and Parent each shall,
upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any

this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration

promptly thereafter mail the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to the stockholders
of the Company. Parent shall also take all reasonable actions required to be
taken under any applicable state blue sky or securities Laws in connection
with the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement. Each party hereto shall furnish all information concerning it and
the holders of its capital stock as the other party hereto may reasonably
request in connection with such actions.   (b) The Company shall call a

5.10(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to Company of any Acquisition Proposal.   (c)
The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
Parent a letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, dated a date within
two business days before each of the date of the Registration Statement and

Form S-4.   5.11 Expenses. Subject to Section 5.5, if this Agreement is
terminated for any reason without breach by any party, each party hereto
shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into, and
carrying out this Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement and to
consummating the Merger, except that the Company and Parent shall divide
equally the costs incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and related
documents.   5.12 Press Releases. Without the consent of the other parties,
prior to the Effective Time none of the parties shall issue, and shall
instruct their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys or other advisers or representatives not to issue, any press
release or make any public announcement or statement with regard to this
Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement or the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; provided, however, that nothing
in this Section 5.12 shall be deemed to (i) prohibit the Company or Parent
from making any disclosures, press releases or announcements relating to
their respective businesses or operations, or (ii) prohibit any party hereto
from making any disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in
order to fulfill such party\'s disclosure obligations imposed by Law or the
rules of any national securities exchange or automated quotation system.  
5.13 Indemnification of Officers and Directors   (a) Until such time as the
applicable statute of limitations shall have expired, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide with respect to each present or former
director and officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the
"Indemnified Parties"), the indemnification rights (including any rights to
advancement of expenses) which such Indemnified Parties had or was made
available to such Indemnified Parties, from the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, immediately prior to the Merger, whether available under
the CBCA, the corporate laws governing any Company Subsidiary, the
Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company or the comparable
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or by any contract,
agreement, arrangement or course of dealing set forth on Schedule 5.13 to the
Company Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect on the date
hereof.      (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under paragraph (a) of this Section 5.13, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
subject to subsections (i) and (ii) below, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, unless the defenses available to such Indemnified Party
are different from or in addition to any defenses available to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, which in such case, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the costs and expenses of one counsel and up to one
local counsel for such Indemnified Party, (ii) subject to the last clause of
subsection (i) above, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to maintain
a joint defense with the Indemnified Party paying its own costs and expenses,
(iii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter and (iv) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and provided,
further, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.   (c) In
the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13.   (d)
Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to (i) maintain the Company\'s current policies of directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance for a period of six years after
the Effective Time or (ii) maintain a run-off or tail policy or endorsement
with respect to covering claims asserted within six years after the Effective
Time arising from facts or events occurring at or before the Effective
Time; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be required to expend
pursuant to this Section 5.13(d) on an annual basis more than an amount equal
to 150% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance
and, in the event the cost of such coverage shall exceed that amount, Parent
shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.       
(e) This Section 5.13 shall survive the Closing and is intended to
benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each of the Indemnified
Parties and his or her heirs and representatives (each of whom shall be
entitled to enforce this Section 5.13 against Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to the extent specified herein) and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.   5.14 Tax
Treatment. Parent and the Company agree to treat the Merger as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Except as
may result from Parent\'s determination to pay a portion of the Merger
Consideration in cash in accordance with Section 1.2(c) and subject to the
Company\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(vi),
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries shall
knowingly take or fail to take any action which action or failure to act
would be reasonably likely to jeopardize qualification of the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.  5.15
Employee Benefits.   (a) (i) Merger Sub hereby agrees to honor and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to honor, and to make required payments when due

commitments of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time which are applicable with respect to any
employee, officer, director or executive or former employee, officer,
director or executive of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each a
"Company Employee"), including the Company Employee Plans set forth on
Schedule 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter.   (ii) Merger Sub hereby
agrees to assume and honor and Parent shall  cause Merger Sub to honor, each
employment, retention, consulting or  severance agreement or arrangement set
forth on Schedule 3.13 of the  Disclosure Letter that was entered into by and
between the Company and any  Company Employee that is in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time  (each such agreement or arrangement, an
"Employee Agreement").   (b) Merger Sub hereby agrees that for a period of
one year immediately following the Effective Time, it shall continue to
provide benefits under employee benefit, incentive compensation, welfare and
fringe benefit plans, programs and policies for the benefit of Company
Employees (other than stock options or other plans involving the issuance of
securities by Parent or Merger Sub) which in the aggregate provide benefits
that are no less favorable than those provided to them under the Company
Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (c) Merger Sub
hereby agrees that following the Effective Time, no Company Employee shall be
entitled to fewer annual vacation days than those to which such individual
was entitled on the date hereof.      (d) Merger Sub hereby agrees that
for a period of two years immediately following the Effective Time, it shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide severance benefits to
employees of the Company and any Company Subsidiary who are terminated by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation at any time during such two year period
in an amount equal to the severance payable under the Company\'s Employees\'
Severance Plan as in effect on the Effective Time.   (e) Parent hereby
agrees that following the Effective Time, it shall or shall cause Merger Sub
to, continue to maintain the Company\'s Directors Charitable Endowment
Program as in effect on the Effective Time, without any amendment thereto
which is adverse to the participants therein. Any and all obligations of the
Company under such program may be satisfied by Parent or any other entity
designated by Parent.   (f) For purposes of all employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the Surviving Corporation) and
for which Company Employees become eligible, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the
prior service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary of each Company
Employee (to the same extent such service is recognized under analogous
plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
prior to the Effective Time) as service rendered to Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, benefit accrual (other than benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan) and determination of benefit levels
thereunder; provided, however, that any benefits provided by Parent under any
(i) employee benefit plans, as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA, (ii)
nonqualified employee benefit or deferred compensation plans, stock option,
bonus or incentive plans or (iii) other employee benefit or fringe benefit
programs, that may be in effect generally for employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries from time to time, shall be reduced by benefits in respect of
the same years of service under analogous plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by or contributed to by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
their Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub shall (x) waive all limitations as
to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees
under any welfare benefit plans that such Company Employees may be eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare benefit
plan maintained for the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (y) provide each Company Employee with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective
Time.        (g) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub, to pay each participant in the
Company\'s long term and short term incentive plans, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of such plans, a lump sum amount in cash with respect to
each performance cycle which includes the Effective Time, calculated based
upon the assumption of achievement of target performance levels under each
applicable plan with respect to each applicable performance cycle. Where the
award with respect to the target performance level is denominated as a range,
such payment shall be the amount (within such range) mutually agreed to by
Parent and the Company.   (h) With respect to each Company Employee who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, is a participant in the Company
Employees\' Retirement Plan and Trust, the Company Excess Retirement Plan, or
the Company Top Hat Plan (collectively, the "Company Pension Plans"), the
Company Pension Plans shall not be terminated or amended in any manner which
is adverse in more than a de minimis way to such participant for a period of
one year immediately following the Effective Time. At no time shall any
benefits which are accrued by the participants in the Company Pension Plans
prior to such one year anniversary be reduced. With respect to each Company
Employee who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, has attained at least
age 50, the Company Retiree Life and Health Insurance Program shall not, for
a period of one year immediately following the Effective Time, be terminated
or amended in any manner which is adverse in more than a de minimis way to
any such individual.        5.16 Rule 145. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who the Company or Parent
believes, at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, is an "affiliate" for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, to deliver to Parent on or
prior to such date a written agreement in terms reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, that such Person will not offer to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued to such Person
pursuant to the Merger, except in accordance with the applicable provisions
of Rule 145, and except in other transactions that are not in violation of
the Securities Act. Schedule 5.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
a list of those persons who the Company believes, at the date hereof, are
"affiliates" for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The
Company shall provide to Parent such information and documents as Parent
shall reasonably request for purposes of identifying "affiliates". There
shall be added to Section 5.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter the names and
addresses of any other Person subsequently identified by either Parent or the
Company as a Person who may be deemed to be such an affiliate of the Company;
provided, however, that no such Person identified by Parent shall be added to
the list of affiliates of the Company if Parent shall receive from the
Company, on or before the date of the Stockholders\' Meeting, an opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such Person is
not such an affiliate. Parent shall not be required to maintain the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement under the Securities Act for the purpose of resale of Parent Common
Stock by such affiliates received in the Merger and the certificates
representing Parent Common Stock received by such affiliates shall bear a
customary legend regarding applicable Securities Act restrictions and the
provisions of this Section.  5.17 Stock Options and Other Incentive
Programs   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have taken all
necessary actions so that at the Effective Time, each unexpired and
unexercised stock option under the Company Stock Plans, or otherwise granted
by the Company outside of any Company Stock Plan (the "Company Stock
Options"), shall become immediately exercisable and will be assumed by Parent
as hereinafter provided. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof,
each Company Stock Option will be automatically converted into an option to
purchase Parent Common Stock (the "New Parent Stock Options"). With respect
to each such New Parent Stock Option (i) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such New Parent Stock Option will be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that could have been
purchased under such Company Stock Option by the Option Exchange Ratio (as
hereinafter defined), and rounding any fractional share up to the nearest
whole share, and (ii) the exercise price per share of such New Parent Stock
Option will be determined by dividing the exercise price per share specified
in the Company Stock Option by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding the
exercise price thus determined up to the nearest whole cent. Such New Parent
Stock Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as
such Company Stock Option. At the Effective Time, (i) all references in the
Company Stock Plans, the applicable stock option or other awards agreements
issued thereunder and in any other Company Stock Options to the Company shall
be deemed to refer to Parent; and (ii) Parent shall assume the Company Stock
Plans and all of the Company\'s obligations with respect to the Company Stock
Options. The Option Exchange Ratio shall mean $41.00 divided by the Base
Period Stock Price.   (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
to the extent necessary to provide for the registration of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such substituted New Parent Stock Options, Parent
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock and shall use its best efforts
to maintain such registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form),
including the current status of any related prospectus or prospectuses, for
so long as New Parent Stock Options remain outstanding.        (c)
Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.17(c) and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual
who (i) is a director or officer of Company or (ii) at the Effective Time,
will become a director or officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with
the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.   (d) The restrictions with respect to all
Company restricted stock awards shall lapse immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the shares of previously restricted stock shall be
converted in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.2(c).   5.18 Other
Actions by the Company and Parent   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the
board of directors of the Company shall take all necessary action to redeem,
or the Company shall use its best efforts to take such other steps as Parent
reasonably requests with respect to, all of the outstanding Capital
Securities. Any actions taken by the Company in order to effect the intent of
this Section 5.18(a) shall not be deemed to violate any other provision of
this Agreement.   (b) The Company shall coordinate with Parent the
declaration, setting of record dates and payment dates of dividends on
Company Common Stock so that holders of Company Common Stock do not receive
dividends on both Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock received in
the Merger in respect of any calendar quarter or fail to receive a dividend
on either Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock received in the Merger
in respect of any calendar quarter.   (c) Within five (5) days of the date
hereof, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of its unadmitted
reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 1999.   (d) Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may take such
actions as are necessary to donate (or to irrevocably commit to donate) the
Company\'s collection of art to an organization recognized under Section
501(c)(3) of the Code that is not a private foundation under Section 509 of
the Code, such contribution not to be covered by Section 170(e)(1)(B)(i) of
the Code.         ARTICLE 6   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO MERGER   6.1

party to effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction on or
prior to the Closing Date of each of the following conditions:   (a) This
Agreement and the Merger shall have been approved and adopted  by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the  outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock.   (b) No Governmental Authority shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated,  enforced or entered any law, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree,  injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent)  which is in effect and has the effect of making
illegal, materially  restricting or in any way preventing or prohibiting the
Merger or the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) The
Registration Statement shall have become effective under the  Securities Act
and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the  Registration Statement
shall be in effect and no proceedings for such  purpose, or under the proxy
rules of the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act  and with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be pending  before or threatened by
the SEC. At the effective date of the Registration  Statement, the
Registration Statement shall not contain any untrue  statement of a material
fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary  in order to make the
statements therein not misleading, and, at the mailing  date of the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the date of the Stockholders\'  Meeting, the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement (as amended or supplemented to that  date) shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to  state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein  not
misleading.   (d) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger shall  have been authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange
upon  official notice of issuance.   6.2 Conditions to Obligations of the

though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent any
such representation or warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date) and
(ii) the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in

breach of any representation, warranty, covenant  or agreement made by Parent
or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any such  representation and warranty
shall have become untrue after the date of this  Agreement, such that

agreement, attaching the most current  version of such agreement to such
notice, (iii) Parent does not make,  within five business days of receipt of
the Company\'s written notification  of its intention to enter into a binding
agreement for a Superior Proposal,  an offer that the Board of Directors of

reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)  of the Code; or   (c)
by Parent if:   (i) the Merger is not consummated on or before the

representation, warranty, covenant  or agreement made by the Company in this

satisfied and such  breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured within 30  days after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the

Kmiecik            Annex 6.3(i)   FORM OF EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT    AGREEMENT by and between HSB Group, Inc., a Connecticut
corporation having its principal executive offices in Hartford, Connecticut,
(the "Company") Engine Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Merger Sub") and __________________ (the "Executive") dated as of the _____
day of August, 2000   The Company, Merger Sub and American International
Group, Inc., a [Delaware] corporation ("AIG") have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective shareholders to assure that the
Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive pending the
merger of the Company and Merger Sub, (the "Merger") pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger between AIG, Merger Sub and the Company dated as
of August 17, 2000 (the "Merger Agreement") and to provide the successor
entity after the Merger with continuity of management. Therefore, in order to
accomplish these objectives, the Executive, Merger Sub and the Company desire
to enter into this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS
FOLLOWS:   1. Effective Date. The "Effective Date" shall mean the effective
date of the Merger, provided the Executive is employed by the Company on that
date. As of the date hereof, the prior [Employment/Severance
Agreement effective _____________, as amended] ("Former Employment
Agreement") between the Executive and the Company shall terminate and become
null and void, provided that upon any termination of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, this sentence will be inapplicable and,
provided, further, that if Executive is not employed by Merger Sub
immediately after the Effective Date, this sentence will be inapplicable.  
2. Employment Period. The Company hereby agrees to continue to employ the
Executive for the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the
fourth anniversary of such date (the "Employment Period"), and the Executive
hereby agrees to continue in the employ of the Company subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.            3. Terms of
Employment.   a. Position and Duties.   i. During the Employment Period,
the Executive shall  serve Merger Sub in the same capacity he is currently 
serving the Company with the appropriate authority, duties  and
responsibilities attendant to such position and in such  other comparable
positions as the board of Merger Sub (the  "Board") may reasonably request.
Any references to Merger  Sub herein shall include reference to any successor
thereto.   ii. During the Employment Period, and excluding any  periods of
vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is  entitled, the Executive
agrees to devote substantially all  of his attention and time during normal
business hours to  the business and affairs of the Company and, to the
extent  necessary to discharge the responsibilities assigned to the 
Executive hereunder, to use the Executive\'s reasonable best  efforts to
perform faithfully and efficiently such  responsibilities. During the
Employment Period it shall not  be a violation of this Agreement for the
Executive to (A)  serve, with prior approval of the Board, on corporate,
civic  or charitable boards or committees and (B) manage personal 
investments, so long as such activities do not significantly  interfere with
the performance of the Executive\'s  responsibilities as an employee of the
Company in accordance  with this Agreement.   b. Compensation.   i.
Annual Base Salary. During the Employment Period,  the Executive shall
receive an annual base salary ("Annual  Base Salary") of at least $_________.
Such Annual Base  Salary shall be subject to periodic review by the Board
for  increases in its sole discretion.   ii. Annual Bonus. During the
Employment Period, the  Executive shall be paid an annual cash bonus in
accordance  with Merger Sub\'s performance based bonus program ("Annual 
Bonus"); provided, however, that the bonus award for 2001 as  a percentage of
Annual Base Salary and the corresponding  target levels shall be those
utilized in the annual  incentive plan that was applicable to the Executive
for the  year 2000 and the applicable performance targets shall be  based on
a formula relating to the operating plan similar to  the one established for
2000 as agreed between Richard H.  Booth and the Board. The Annual Bonus
shall be paid in  accordance with Merger Sub\'s customary
practices.        (iii) Retention Bonus. If the Executive is employed 
with Merger Sub on the first anniversary of the Effective  Date, the
Executive shall be paid a retention bonus equal to  the Annual Base Salary
(the "Retention Bonus"). The  Retention Bonus shall be paid within one month
of such  anniversary.   (iv) Other Employee Benefit Plans. During the 
Employment Period, except as otherwise expressly provided  herein, the
Executive shall be eligible to participate in  all employee benefit, welfare
and other plans, practices,  policies and programs and fringe benefits
(including,  without limitation, stock options and other equity based 
compensation plans) of Merger Sub (collectively, "Employee  Benefit Plans")
on a basis no less favorable than that  provided to other senior executive
officers of the Company  and other similarly situated executives of other
AIG  subsidiaries; provided, however, that nothing shall require 
Executive\'s participation in any Employee Benefit Plans in  which the
participation of any individual employee is  discretionary. Executive\'s
prior service with the Company  shall be taken into account for all purposes
except benefit  accruals.   4. Termination of Employment.   a. Death or
Disability. The Executive\'s employment shall  terminate automatically upon
the Executive\'s death during the  Employment Period. If Merger Sub
determines in good faith that  the Disability of the Executive has occurred
during the  Employment Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability set 
forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in  accordance with
Section 11(b) of this Agreement of its intention  to terminate the
Executive\'s employment. In such event, the  Executive\'s employment with
Merger Sub shall terminate effective  on the 30th day after receipt of such
notice by the Executive  (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided that,
within the 30  days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned
to  full-time performance of the Executive\'s duties. For purposes of  this
Agreement, "Disability" shall mean the absence of the  Executive from the
Executive\'s duties with Merger Sub on a  full-time basis for 180 business
days during any consecutive  twelve month period as a result of incapacity
due to mental or  physical illness which is determined to be total and
permanent by  a physician selected by Merger Sub or its insurers and
acceptable  to the Executive or the Executive\'s legal representative.   b.
Cause. Merger Sub may terminate the Executive\'s  employment during the
Employment Period for Cause. For purposes  of this Agreement, "Cause" shall
mean:   i. the engaging by the Executive in gross misconduct  which is
materially and demonstrably injurious to Merger Sub  or illegal conduct,  
ii. the conviction of a felony or guilty or nolo  contendere plea to a felony
by the Executive, or       iii. the continued failure by the Executive
to  substantially perform the Executive\'s duties with Merger Sub  after
written demand for substantial performance is  delivered to the Executive by
the Board, which demand states  a reasonable period of time within which the
Executive must  correct such failure.  Any act, or failure to act, based
upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or
upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer (while the Executive
does not serve as such) or based upon the advice of counsel for Merger Sub
shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the
Executive in good faith and in the best interests of Merger Sub and shall
under no circumstances constitute misconduct. The cessation of employment of
the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there
shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution
duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than 75% of the entire
membership of the Board (excluding the Executive) at a meeting of the Board
called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the
Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel,
to be heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the
Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i),
(ii) or (iii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.   c.
Good Reason. The Executive\'s employment may be terminated by  the Executive
for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good  Reason" shall mean in
the absence of a written consent of the  Executive:   i. the assignment to
the Executive of any duties materially  inconsistent with the Executive\'s
position, authority, duties or  responsibilities as contemplated by this
Agreement, or any other  action by Merger Sub which results in a material
diminution in  such position, authority, duties or responsibilities,
excluding  for this purpose an action not taken in bad faith and which is 
remedied by Merger Sub promptly after receipt of notice thereof  given by the
Executive and further excluding for this purpose the  fact that Merger Sub
will be a non-publicly traded subsidiary of  AIG after the Effective
Date;   ii. any failure by Merger Sub to comply with the provisions  of
Section 3 (b) of this Agreement, other than a failure not  occurring in bad
faith and which is remedied by Merger Sub  promptly after receipt of notice
thereof given by the Executive;   iii. any purported termination by Merger
Sub of the  Executive\'s employment otherwise than as expressly permitted
by  this Agreement;        iv. any failure by Merger Sub to comply
with and satisfy  Section 10(c) of this Agreement; or   (v) any requirement
that the Executive (A) be based anywhere  more than fifty (50) miles from the
office where the Executive is  currently located or (B) travel on Company
business to an extent  substantially greater than the Executive\'s current
travel  obligations.   d. Notice of Termination. Any termination by Merger
Sub or by the  Executive shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to
the other  party hereto given in accordance with Section 11(b) of this
Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means
a  written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision  in
this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets  forth in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to  provide a basis for
termination of the Executive\'s employment under  the provision so indicated
and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as  defined below) is other than the
date of receipt of such notice,  specifies the termination date (which date
shall be not more than  thirty days after the giving of such notice). The
failure by the  Executive or Merger Sub to set forth in the Notice of
Termination any  fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good
Reason or  Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or Merger Sub, 
respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or Merger Sub, 
respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing  the
Executive\'s or Merger Sub\'s rights hereunder.   e. Date of Termination.
"Date of Termination" means if the  Executive\'s employment is terminated by
Merger Sub other than for  Disability, or by the Executive, the date of
receipt of the Notice of  Termination or any later date specified therein
within 30 days of such  notice, and if the Executive\'s employment is
terminated by reason of  death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall
be the date of  death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as
the case  may be.   5. Obligations of the Company upon
Termination.        a. Any Reason. If, during the Employment Period,
the Executive\'s  employment is terminated for any reason, Merger Sub shall
(i) pay to  the Executive the Executive\'s Annual Base Salary through the
Date of  Termination to the extent not theretofore paid and any other bonus 
payments for a prior bonus year that have been earned but not yet paid  and
(ii) to the extent not theretofore paid or provided, pay or  provide to the
Executive any other amounts or benefits required to be  paid or provided or
which the Executive is eligible to receive under  any plan, program, policy
or practice or contract or agreement of  Merger Sub and its affiliated
companies through the Date of  Termination and Executive\'s other normal
post-termination compensation  and benefits (including payments under
retirement and retiree medical  programs), if any, as such payments become
due.1 The payments and  benefits provided under Sections 5 (b), (c), (d) and
(e) below are in  addition to the payments required under this Section
5(a).   (b) Good Reason; Other Than for Cause. If, during the Employment 
Period, Merger Sub shall terminate the Executive\'s employment other  than
for Cause, or the Executive shall terminate employment for Good  Reason:  
(i) Merger Sub shall pay to the Executive in a lump  sum in cash within 30
days after the Date of Termination an amount  equal to the product of (x) the
sum of the Executive\'s Annual Base  Salary and the average Annual Bonus paid
to the Executive (including as  paid for this purpose any compensation earned
but deferred, whether or  not at the election of the Executive and whether or
not vested) for the  three years prior to the Date of Termination (the
"Average Annual  Bonus") and (y) 3.0 (if the Date of Termination is on or
before the  second anniversary of the Effective Date), 2.0 (if the Date of 
Termination is after the second anniversary but on or before the third 
anniversary of the Effective Date) or 1.0 (if the Date of Termination  is
after the third anniversary but on or before the fourth anniversary  of the
Effective Date), provided that any such amount shall be  decreased by the
amount of any Retention Bonus paid to the Executive.   (ii) for the
remainder of the Employment Period, Merger Sub  shall continue to provide
insurance, medical, dental and other welfare  benefits to the Executive, his
spouse and eligible dependents on the  same basis as such benefits are then
currently provided to its  employees ("Welfare Benefits"); provided that any
payments received  with respect to such Welfare Benefits shall be secondary
to any  payments made pursuant to other coverage obtained by the
Executive.2        6. Non-exclusivity of Rights. Except as specifically
provided and subject to Section 11, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent
or limit the Executive\'s continuing or future participation in any plan,
program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated
companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor, subject to Section
11(f), shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the
Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of
its affiliated companies. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the
Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice
or program of or any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its
affiliated companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be
payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract
or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement; provided that
the Executive shall not be eligible for severance benefits under any other
program or policy of the Company.   7. No Mitigation. In no event shall the
Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by
way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the
provisions of this Agreement, and such amounts shall not be reduced whether
or not the Executive obtains other employment. The Company agrees to pay, to
the fullest extent permitted, all reasonable legal fees and expenses which
the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest pursued or
defended against in good faith by the Executive regarding the validity or
enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement or any
guarantee of performance thereof (including as a result of any contest by the
Executive about the amount of any payment pursuant to this Agreement). Such
payments shall be made within 10 business days of the delivery of
Executive\'s written request for payment accompanied by such evidence of
the fees and expenses incurred by Executive as Merger Sub may reasonably
request.   8. Certain Additional Payments by the Company.        a.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set
forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or
distribution by Merger Sub to or for the benefit of the Executive
(whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any
additional payments required under this Section 8) (a "Payment") would be
subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest
or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax
(such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive
shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in
an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including
any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including,
without limitation, any income and employment taxes (and any interest and
penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the
Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment
equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.   b. Subject to the
provisions of Section 8(c), all determinations required to be made under this
Section 8, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the
amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in
arriving at such determination, shall be made by Merger Sub\'s independent
auditors or such other certified public accounting firm reasonably acceptable
to the Executive as may be designated by Merger Sub (the "Accounting Firm")
which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to Merger Sub and
the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from
the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is
requested by Merger Sub. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne solely by Merger Sub. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant
to this Section 8, shall be paid by Merger Sub to the Executive within five
days of the later of (i) the due date for the payment of any Excise Tax, and
(ii) the receipt of the Accounting Firm\'s determination. Any determination
by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Merger Sub and the Executive. As
a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at
the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is
possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by Merger Sub
should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations
required to be made hereunder. In the event that Merger Sub exhausts its
remedies pursuant to Section 8(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to
make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the
amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall
be promptly paid by Merger Sub to or for the benefit of the
Executive.        c. The Executive shall notify Merger Sub in writing
of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would
require the payment by Merger Sub of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification
shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days
after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprize
Merger Sub of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is
requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the
expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such
notice to Merger Sub (or such shorter period ending on the date that any
payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If Merger Sub notifies
the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it
desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:   i. give Merger Sub any
information reasonably requested by  Merger Sub relating to such claim,  
ii. take such action in connection with contesting such  claim as Merger Sub
shall reasonably request in writing from time to  time, including, without
limitation, accepting legal representation  with respect to such claim by an
attorney reasonably selected by Merger  Sub,   iii. cooperate with Merger
Sub in good faith in order  effectively to contest such claim, and   iv.
permit Merger Sub to participate in any proceedings  relating to such
claim;  provided, however, that Merger Sub shall bear and pay directly all
costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in
connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive
harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income or employment
tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a
result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without
limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(c), Merger Sub shall
control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its
sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals,
proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of
such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay
the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible
manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination
before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in
one or more appellate courts, as Merger Sub shall determine; provided,
however, that if Merger Sub directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue
for a refund, Merger Sub shall advance the amount of such payment to the
Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the
Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax
(including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect
to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such
advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of
limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of
the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be
due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, Merger Sub\'s
control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a
Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be
entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by
the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.        d.
If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by Merger Sub
pursuant to Section 8(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any
refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall promptly pay to Merger
Sub the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited
thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by
the Executive of an amount advanced by Merger Sub pursuant to Section 8(c),
a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any
refund with respect to such claim and Merger Sub does not notify the
Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to
the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall
be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such
advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment
required to be paid.   9. Covenants Not to Solicit Company Employees;
Confidential Information.   a. During the term of this Agreement and for a
period of one year after the Date of Termination by the Company or the
Executive for any reason, the Executive further agrees that the Executive
shall not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, solicit any person who is
an employee of the Company to apply for or accept employment with any
competing business. The term "solicit" as used in this Agreement means any
communication of any kind whatsoever, regardless of by whom initiated,
inviting, encouraging or requesting any person or entity to take or refrain
from taking any action.   b. Executive agrees that, during the term of this
Agreement and at all times thereafter, he shall continue to hold in a
fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company, all secret or confidential
information, knowledge or data relating to the Company and any other business
or entity in which, at any relevant time, the Company holds an equity (voting
or non-voting) interest equal to or greater than 10% (an "Affiliate") that
shall have been obtained by Executive during his employment by or affiliation
with the Company or its Affiliates, and that shall not be public knowledge
other than by acts of Executive and his representative ("Confidential
Material"). Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the
[Chief Executive Officer] of the Company, communicate or divulge any
Confidential Material to anyone other than the Company and those designated
by it.        c. Executive acknowledges that any material violation of
the foregoing covenants in Section 9 could cause the Company irreparable harm
and he agrees that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief
restraining Executive from actual or threatened breach of such covenants, and
that if a bond is required to be posted in order for the Company to secure
such relief, said bond need only be in a nominal amount. Subject to Section
9(d) below, the right of the Company to seek injunctive relief shall be in
addition to any other remedies available to the Company with respect to an
alleged or threatened breach.   d. Nothing in Section 9 hereof shall be
construed to adversely affect the rights that the Company would possess in
the absence of the provisions of such sections.   e. The provision by the
Company of the compensation and benefits described under this agreement, as
applicable, hereunder are conditioned upon Executive\'s compliance with the
terms described under this Agreement and the execution, non-revocation and
honoring of a release of claims and covenant not to sue in favor of the
Company, which release shall be in the form generally used by the Company for
such purposes.   f. The terms and provisions of this Section 9 are intended
to be separate and divisible provisions and if, for any reason, any one or
more of them is held to be invalid or unenforceable, neither the validity nor
the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall thereby be
affected. The parties hereto acknowledge that the potential restrictions on
the Executive\'s future employment imposed by this Section 9 are reasonable
in both duration and geographic scope and in all other respects. If for any
reason any court of competent jurisdiction shall find any provisions of this
Section 9 unreasonable in duration or geographic scope or otherwise, the
Executive and the Company agree that the restrictions and prohibitions
contained herein shall be effective to the fullest extent allowed under
applicable law in such jurisdiction.   g. The parties acknowledge that this
Agreement would not have been entered into and the benefits described in
Sections 3 or 5 would not have been promised in the absence of the
Executive\'s promises under this Section 9.   (h) Use of the term Company in
this Section 9 shall also include Merger Sub, AIG and their subsidiaries.  
10. Successors.   a. This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without
the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the
Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Executive\'s legal representatives.   b. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and
assigns.        c. The Company will require any successor (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all
or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume
expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean
the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or
assets as aforesaid.   11. Miscellaneous.   a. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York, without reference to principles of conflict of laws. The captions of
this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force
or effect. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective
successors and legal representatives.   b. All notices and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by hand
delivery to the other party or by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:   If to the
Executive, at the address written below Executive\'s name on the signature
page of this Agreement   If to the Company:   American International
Group, Inc.  [o]  [o]   Telecopy Number:  Attention:  or to such other
address as either party shall have furnished to the other in writing in
accordance herewith. Notice and communications shall be effective when
actually received by the addressee.   c. The invalidity or unenforceability
of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.   d. The Company
may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal,
state, local or foreign taxes as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to
any applicable law or regulation.        e. The Executive\'s or the
Company\'s failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of
this Agreement or the failure to assert any right the Executive or the
Company may have hereunder, including, without limitation, the right of the
Executive to terminate employment for Good Reason pursuant to Section
4(c)(i)-(iv) of this Agreement, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such
provision or right or any other provision or right of this Agreement.   f.
From and after the Effective Date this Agreement shall supersede any other
employment agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive has hereunto set
the Executive\'s hand and, pursuant to the authorization from its Board of
Directors, the Company has caused these presents to be executed in its name
on its behalf, all as of the day and year first above written.
