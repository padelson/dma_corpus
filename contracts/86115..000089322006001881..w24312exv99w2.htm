 WHEREAS, SDI and SRAV are stockholders of the Company; Safeguard Capital, SRAI and SRAC are members of SRAV; and SDI, SRAV, Safeguard Capital, SRAI and SRAC are collectively referred to herein as the " _Principal Stockholders_ "; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined below), and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The surviving corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_." 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as promptly as practicable, but no later than five (5) business days, following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), at the offices of Kelley Drye and Warren LLP, 101 Park Avenue, New York, New York, unless another place or date is agreed to by Parent and the Company. The date upon which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a properly completed and executed Certificate of Merger satisfying the requirements of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of such filing being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

The Base Merger Consideration, increased or decreased on account of the adjustments set forth in Section 1.10, is referred to as the _"Merger Consideration_."

 (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Stockholders: 

  

 (i) each share of the capital stock of the Company (" _Capital Stock_ ") held in the treasury of the Company shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; 

   

 (ii) each Stockholder shall have its shares cancelled and extinguished (except for Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) at the Closing and shall only be entitled to receive, for each share of Capital Stock owned immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount equal to:

If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing Capital Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 1. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.7 _Options._

 Section 1.11 _Net Working Capital Adjustments._  

  

 (a) As at the Closing Date, the Company shall have a Closing Net Working Capital of $3,400,000 (the _"Target Amount"_ ). _"Closing Net Working Capital"_ means (a) the sum of the current assets (including accounts receivable) other than Cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries as reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or Final Closing Balance Sheet, as applicable, and as calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus any Parent Transaction Expenses paid by the Company prior to Closing, minus (b) the sum of the current liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries as reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or Final Closing Balance Sheet, as applicable, and as calculated in accordance with GAAP, but specifically excluding any liabilities for the current portion of any Funded Debt, Change of Control Payments, and Parent Transaction Expenses. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _GAAP_ " shall mean generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, applied on a consistent basis with past practices as set forth in the Financial Statements (as defined below). Attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ is an example of the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, setting forth the line items included in current assets and current liabilities, as well as the other amounts described in this _Section 1.11(a)_. 

  

 (b) The Company shall deliver to the Parent at least five business days prior to the scheduled Closing Date an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with the CompanyÂ’s estimate of Closing Net Working Capital derived therefrom. Parent may review the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and, in connection therewith, have reasonable access to (i) the personnel and records of the Company and (ii) the personnel and work papers related to the preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. At least two business days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, Parent will notify the Stockholder Representative and the Company whether or not it finds such estimate of Closing Net Working Capital reasonably acceptable to it. If Parent fails to notify the Stockholder Representative and the Company of any such objections in writing within such two business day period, Parent will be conclusively deemed to have concurred with the CompanyÂ’s estimate of Closing Net Working Capital. If the CompanyÂ’s estimate of Closing Net Working Capital is not reasonably acceptable to Parent and Parent timely notifies the Stockholder Representative and the Company of its objections in accordance with this _Section 1.11(b)_, Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly consult with each other in good faith and exercise commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve differences in their respective analyses of the estimated Closing Net Working Capital prior to the scheduled Closing Date. If Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the Company cannot reach an agreement prior to the scheduled Closing Date on estimated Closing Net Working Capital, estimated Closing Net Working Capital 

     ##### 

  

    

shall be the midpoint of the estimated Closing Net Working Capital proposed by
the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative and the
Company, on the other hand. 

   

 (c) If estimated Closing Net Working Capital is within 20% of the Target Amount (either higher or lower), no adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall be made. If estimated Closing Net Working Capital is more than 20% lower than the Target Amount then the Merger Consideration and any payment by Parent to Stockholders on the Closing Date shall be reduced pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(iii) above by the amount by which the estimated Closing Net Working Capital is more than 20% lower than the Target Amount. If estimated Closing Net Working Capital is more than 20% higher than the Target Amount then the Merger Consideration and any payment by Parent to Stockholders on the Closing Date shall be increased pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(iii) above by the amount by which the estimated Closing Net Working Capital is more than 20% higher than the Target Amount. 

   

 (d) Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event not later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the consolidated balance sheet of Company and its Subsidiaries, and the notes and schedules thereto (if any) (the _"Final Closing Balance Sheet"),_ together with ParentÂ’s determination of Closing Net Working Capital derived therefrom. The Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

   

 (e) The Stockholder Representative may review the Final Closing Balance Sheet and, in connection therewith, have reasonable access to the work papers related to the preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, as well as to the Company and Parent personnel responsible for the preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet. Within twenty (20) days following the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s receipt of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, the Stockholder Representative will notify Parent in writing whether it concurs with ParentÂ’s determination of Closing Net Working Capital or whether it has any objections thereto. If the Stockholder Representative fails to notify Parent of any such objections in writing within such twenty (20) day period, the Stockholder Representative will be conclusively deemed to have concurred with ParentÂ’s determination of Closing Net Working Capital. 

   

 (f) If the Stockholder Representative does not concur with ParentÂ’s determination of Closing Net Working Capital and timely notifies Parent of its objections in accordance with _Section 1.11(e)_ , Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, shall promptly consult with each other in good faith and exercise commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve differences in their respective analyses of the Final Closing Balance Sheet within ten (10) days after the Stockholder Representative notifies Parent of its objections. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve their differences within such ten (10) day period, the matter shall be promptly referred to a mutually satisfactory independent accounting firm (the _"Independent Accounting Firm"_ ) who shall resolve such differences within twenty (20) days after the matter is referred to it on the basis of GAAP. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm, including the interpretation of relevant provisions of this Agreement, will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. 

   

 (g) If the Independent Accounting Firm is engaged to resolve differences between the Stockholder Representative and the Parent in accordance with _Section 1.11(f)_, the 

     ##### 

  

    

fees and expenses of such accounting firm in performing services pursuant to

 (ii) If the final determination of Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the estimated Closing Net Working Capital determined pursuant to _Section 1.11(b)_ above, and: 

   

 (A) if the final determination of Closing Net Working Capital is no more than 20% above or below the Target Amount and Parent had decreased the Merger Consideration paid on the Closing Date in accordance with _Section 1.11(c)_ above, then Parent shall pay the Stockholders and the Option Holders for such deficient payment made on the Closing Date, 

   

 (B) if the final determination of Closing Net Working Capital is more than 20% above the Target Amount, and the estimated Closing Net Working Capital was more than 20% below the Target Amount, then Parent shall pay to the Stockholders and the Option Holders the amount decreased from the Merger Consideration paid on the Closing Date in accordance with

 (a) Each Plan which has been maintained by the Company and which has been intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received or can reasonably rely on a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") regarding its qualification under that section and has, in fact, been qualified under that section of the Code from the effective date of such Plan through and including the Closing (or, if earlier, the date that all of such PlanÂ’s assets were distributed).

Neither the 

   #####

provided health care or any other non-pension benefits to any employees after

 (i) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and any Related Documents to which the Company is a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will not conflict with or result in any violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any benefit under any Plan, trust or loan that would reasonably be expected to result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee.

 (b) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Company and the Stockholders, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the ParentÂ’s Indemnified Persons based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations, will not be limited or affected by any investigation conducted by Parent or any agent of Parent with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Parent or any agent of Parent at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with or performance of any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

 (f) The Stockholders and the Parent acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing Date, the indemnification provisions of _Sections 7.2 and 7.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties for any breach of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement. 

  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything else in this _Article 7_, in the event that any ParentÂ’s Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ for Damages suffered or incurred as a result of a breach of any of the Fundamental Representations set forth in  _Article 4_, then, (i) such Principal Stockholder shall be solely liable for such Damages and no other Principal Stockholder will have any liability with respect thereto; and (ii) the indemnification obligation of such Principal Stockholder with respect to such Damages shall not exceed that portion of the Merger Consideration allocated to such Principal Stockholder in respect of his, her or its Shares.

 (i) The Stockholders and the Parent agree, for themselves and on behalf of the StockholdersÂ’ Indemnified Persons and ParentÂ’s Indemnified Persons, respectively, to take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate their respective Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Indemnification Procedure_. 

  

 (a) Each ParentÂ’s Indemnified Person or StockholdersÂ’ Indemnified Person seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall, with reasonable promptness after obtaining knowledge thereof, provide the Stockholder Representative or the Parent, respectively, with written notice of all third party actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands or assessments that may be subject to the indemnification provisions of this _Article 7_ (collectively, " _Third Party Claims_ "), including, in reasonable detail, the basis for the claim, the nature of the ParentÂ’s Damages and a good faith estimate of the amount of such Damages and any and all data and information relating to the claim. Any party against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under this _Article 7_ is referred to as an " _Indemnifying Party_." 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Parent or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable, shall have 15 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the Indemnified Party in writing whether the Indemnifying Party agrees that the claim is subject to this _Article 7_ and, if so, whether the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (subject to the consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be withheld or delayed unreasonably), and at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s sole risk and expense, the good faith settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim. 

  

 (c) If within 15 days after its receipt of the claim notice, Parent or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable, notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake the good faith settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith including, without limitation, by making available to the Indemnifying Party all relevant information material to the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party, at its expense, and to approve any proposed settlement that would impose any obligation or duty on the Indemnified Party; provided that such participation shall be at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s cost and expense if a conflict of interest exists. So long as an Indemnifying Party is contesting the Third Party Claim in good faith and with reasonable diligence, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any Third Party Claim under this subsection (c), provided that in such event it waives any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (d) If Parent or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable, does not provide notice within 15 days that the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake the good faith settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party fails to timely contest the Third Party Claim or undertake or approve settlement, in good faith and with reasonable diligence, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have the right to contest, settle or compromise the Third Party Claim at its exclusive discretion, at the risk and reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party, subject to the limits set forth in _Section 7.4_, and the Indemnifying Party will thereby waive any claim, defense or argument that the Indemnified PartyÂ’s settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim is in respect inadequate or unreasonable provided the Indemnified Party shall have conducted the defense or settlement thereof in a manner reasonably satisfactory and intended to limit, to the extent reasonably possible, the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, and no compromise or settlement shall be agreed to or made without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (e) An Indemnified PartyÂ’s failure to give timely notice of a Third Party Claim under this  _Section 7.5_ will not constitute a defense, in part or in whole, to any claim for indemnification by such Indemnified Party, unless (i) such failure results in any material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party (but only to the extent of such prejudice) or (ii) the Indemnified Party fails to provide written notice of any such claim within the applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 7.1_. An Indemnified PartyÂ’s failure to give timely notice of a claim for indemnification will not constitute a defense, in part or in whole, to any claim for indemnification by such Indemnified Party, except if, and only to the extent that, such failure results in any material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party (but only to the extent of such prejudice). 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 7.6 _Non-Third Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) Each Indemnified Party shall, with reasonable promptness, deliver to the Stockholder Representative, in the case of a claim for indemnification under _Section 7.2_, or to Parent, in the case of claim for indemnification under _Section 7.3_ written notice of all claims for indemnification under this Article 7, other than Third Party Claims, including, in reasonable detail, the basis for the claim, the nature of Damages and a good faith estimate of the amount of Damages and any and all data relating to the claim. 

  

 (b) The Parent or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable, shall have sixty (60) days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the Indemnified Party in writing whether the Indemnifying Party accepts or disputes liability, subject to the limits set forth in _Section 7.4_ , for all or any part of the Damages described in the claim notice. If the Indemnifying Party does not so notify the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to accept liability, subject to the limits set forth in _Section 7.4_, for all the Damages described in the claim notice. 

  

 (c) An Indemnified PartyÂ’s failure to give timely notice of a claim for any indemnification hereunder will not constitute a defense, in part or in whole, to any claim for indemnification by such Indemnified Party, except if, and only to the extent that, such failure results in any material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party (and only to the extent of such prejudice) or the Indemnified Party fails to provide written notice of any such claim within the applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 7.1_. 

  

 Section 7.7 _Escrow Agreement_. So long as the Escrow Agreement continues in effect in accordance with its terms, the StockholdersÂ’ liability for indemnification hereunder shall be satisfied first by payment from the funds held in escrow under the Escrow Agreement, in accordance with the procedures therein. 

  

 Section 7.8 _Stockholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Principal Stockholders by its execution and delivery of this Agreement, and each Stockholder other than the Principal Stockholders, by his, her or its execution of a Letter of Transmittal, shall appoint the Stockholder Representative with full power and authority to execute and deliver any certificates or documents required to be delivered at Closing by the Stockholders, in such capacity on behalf of the Stockholders, and, in all events, all such acts shall be fully effective for all purposes of this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Stockholder Representative, through its authorized representatives, shall have full power and authority to act in all respects hereunder in its sole discretion, as the sole, true and lawful agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact of each of the Stockholders, with full power and authority to take all actions contemplated by and exercise all rights to be taken in the name of and for and on behalf of the Stockholders with respect to all matters to be performed or otherwise undertaken by the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement and the Related Documents (including the Escrow Agreement), including, but not limited to, (i) the right to execute and deliver certificates, receipts, documents and papers that may be necessary or deemed advisable by the Stockholder Representative to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Documents, and generally to act for and in the name and on behalf of each of the Stockholders with respect to the transactions contemplated by 

   ##### 

  

    

this Agreement and the Related Documents as fully as could each Stockholder if
personally present and acting; and (ii) otherwise to take all action that the
Stockholder Representative may consider necessary or appropriate in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Related Documents. 

  

 (b) Each Stockholder confers and grants to the Stockholder Representative the authority contained herein for the purpose of completing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Documents. All power and authority conferred by the Stockholders to the Stockholder Representative is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable; and to the extent not prohibited by law, shall not be terminated by any acts of any of the Stockholders or by operation of law or by occurrence of any event whatsoever, including the death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation, termination, bankruptcy or insolvency of any of the Stockholders. 

  

 (c) Each Stockholder releases the Stockholder Representative from, and agrees to indemnify the Stockholder Representative against, liability for any action taken or not taken by it in its capacity as such, except for any liability of the Stockholder Representative to a Stockholder for loss which such Stockholder may suffer from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Stockholder Representative. 

  

 (d) The Stockholder Representative shall receive no compensation for services rendered as Stockholder Representative, but, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall receive reimbursement from, and be indemnified by, the Stockholders, pro rata, out of any remaining portions of the Escrow Amount otherwise payable to Stockholders upon termination of the escrow for any and all otherwise unreimbursed Company Transaction Expenses and other liabilities incurred by the Stockholder Representative, whether such Company Transaction Expenses and other liabilities are incurred before, on or after the Effective Time. Unless the Stockholders or the Escrow Agent (with the consent of the Parent upon conclusion of the escrow period) pays all such Company Transaction Expenses and other liabilities upon demand by the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative shall have no obligation to continue to incur such Company Transaction Expenses and other liabilities, or to continue to perform any duties hereunder. The Stockholder Representative may charge all such Company Transaction Expenses and other liabilities against any payment to which the Stockholders may be entitled under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; provided that the Stockholder Representative gives written notice of the amount of such expenses to Parent or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, at least two (2) business days prior to the date of such payment, and an accounting of how such expenses shall be borne by the Stockholders. Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely entirely on any such written notice in reducing the amount of any payments to be made to any Stockholders in respect of any payments.

reasonably be expected to make the timely satisfaction of any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.13 or 8.14_, as the case may be,
incapable of satisfaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 8.7_ shall not limit or otherwise

 (c) Parent shall not make an election pursuant to Section 338 of the Code with respect to the acquisition of the Shares. 

  

 (d) Stockholder Representative shall prepare all income Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due after Closing for income Tax Returns that only include a tax period that began before the Closing Date and end on or before the Closing Date (" _Final Tax Returns_ "), in a manner consistent with past Tax Returns and will provide Parent with a draft of each such Final Tax Return no later than forty-five (45) days before the due date for the filing of such Final Tax Return (taking into account any valid extensions of time for the filing) for ParentÂ’s review and comment. Stockholder Representative shall consider in good faith the comments of Parent. Parent shall cause the Company to reasonably cooperate in the preparation of the Final Tax Returns. Stockholder Representative shall give reasonable advance notice of what cooperation it will require and will coordinate with Parent the logistics thereof. Parent shall cause the Company and Subsidiaries to file the Final Tax Returns in a timely manner. 

  

 (e) Parent shall not cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to file any amended Tax Returns for periods that began before Closing without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative. 

  

 (f) The Company and Parent will notify Stockholder Representative within 10 days of receipt of a notice of an intention of a Governmental Authority to audit the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to Taxes for a period that began before the Closing Date and end on or before the Closing Date. Stockholder Representative shall have the right to control the audit, and 

   ##### 

  

    

any related administrative or judicial proceedings, and the settlement of the
issues raised on the audit; provided, that no settlement may be entered into
without the consent of Parent, which may not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. 

  

 (g) Prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a study of the potential changes of ownership prepared for the Company that could give rise to a limitation of the use of the NOL because of an ownership change, as defined under Section 382 of the Code, in the form of  _Exhibit H_ hereto (the " _Section 382 Study_"). The Section 382 Study will address only federal tax laws. If the Section 382 Study determines that there was an ownership change of the Company or its Subsidiaries (whose net operating losses are included in the NOL), other than on October 1, 2003, such that there is a Section 382 limitation on such date, the Company will deliver to Parent its determination of the difference between the net present value of the tax benefit of the NOL as shown on _Section 8.9_ of the CompanyÂ’s Disclosure Schedule ( the " _Expected Benefit_ ") and the net present value of the tax benefit of the NOL given the change of ownership shown in the Section 382 Study (the " _Revised Benefit_ ") using the same assumptions and methodology (the _"Differential"_ ). Parent shall be deemed to have accepted the Differential unless it provides the Stockholder Representative a written notice of disagreement, specifying the items of disagreement within 10 business days of receipt of the Differential. If Parent agrees with the Differential, Parent shall reduce the amount of the Merger Consideration payable at Closing by the amount of the Differential. If Parent timely provides such notice of disagreement, Parent and Stockholder Representative will negotiate in good faith to resolve the items of dispute. If no agreement is reached within 10 business days of the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s receipt of such notice of disagreement, the matter shall be referred to an Independent Accounting Firm who shall be directed to resolve such differences within forty-five (45) days after the matter is referred to it on the basis of the assumptions and methodology set forth on _Section 8.9_ of the CompanyÂ’s Disclosure Schedule. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. If the Independent Accounting Firm is engaged to resolve differences between the Stockholder Representative and the Parent in accordance with this  _Section 8.9(g)_, the fees and expenses of such accounting firm in performing services pursuant to this _Section 8.9(g)_ shall be borne equally by Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative (subject to reimbursement in accordance with _Section 7.8_), on the other hand. Upon determination by the Independent Accounting Firm, the Principal Stockholders shall be liable to the Parent for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent for, the difference between the Expected Benefit and the Revised Benefit, if the Expected Benefit is higher than the Revised Benefit, as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 8.9_. Any payments required to be paid pursuant to the prior sentence shall be paid directly by the Principal Stockholders and shall not be paid from, or reduce the amount of, the Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the indemnification provided for under this _Section 8.9(g)_ shall be the sole remedy for a breach of the representation in  _Section 3.12(f)_. 

  

 Section 8.10 _Exercise and Termination of Company Options and Warrants_. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver proper notice to each holder of an Option or a Warrant informing such holder of the effect of the transactions contemplated hereby on the Options and Warrants. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to (i) terminate effective as of the Effective Time the Company Option Plan and (ii) terminate each Option outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing 

   ##### 

  

    

Date which has an exercise price above the Per Share Merger Consideration. As
of the Effective Time, no Options or Warrants shall be outstanding. 

  

 Section 8.11 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers of the Company_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, at ParentÂ’s cost, the Company shall purchase, and for six years after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, maintain, a policy of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance coverage for each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), which policy shall provide not less than the existing coverage and shall have other terms not materially less favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties than the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance coverage presently maintained covering the Company Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything contained in this  _Section 8.11_ to the contrary, nothing herein shall obligate Parent or the Company to provide more favorable coverage than that presently maintained by the Company. 

  

 (b) For six years after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify and hold harmless each Company Indemnified Party against (i) all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities, judgments or amounts paid in settlement (the " _Company Indemnified Liabilities_ ") in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date and (ii) all Company Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the full extent a corporation is permitted by law to indemnify its own directors and officers (the " _Company Indemnified Proceedings_ "). In the event any Company Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any Company Indemnified Proceeding, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such Company Indemnified Proceeding to each Company Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking contemplated by Section 145 of the DGCL or other applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Company Indemnified Proceeding is brought against any Company Indemnified Party, (i) the Company Indemnified Parties may, upon receipt of written approval by the Parent, retain counsel of their choosing, (ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay all reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such counsel for the Company Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received, and (iii) Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter;  _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and further, provided, that if Parent does approve a Company Indemnified Parties retention of counsel, Parent will undertake the defense of such Company Indemnified Parties at its own expense. Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 8.11(b)_ upon becoming aware of any such Company Indemnified Proceeding shall promptly notify Parent (but the failure to so notify Parent shall not relieve Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any liability it may have under this 

   ##### 

  

 

 _Section 8.11(b)_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
Parent, the Company or any such Subsidiary), and shall deliver to Parent, the
Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, the undertaking contemplated by
Section 145 of the DGCL or other applicable Law. The Company Indemnified
Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them with
respect to each such Company Indemnified Proceeding unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant
issue between the positions of any two or more Company Indemnified Parties,
in which case, the foregoing limitation shall not apply and,
without limitation of the other indemnification obligations of Parent, the
Company and its Subsidiaries under this _Section 8.11(b)_, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, pay the reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of all of the Company Indemnified Parties,
including such fees and expenses of such additional law firm(s). 

   

 (c) Parent will, and will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor all rights to indemnification existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the Company Indemnified Parties, including pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Company Indemnified Party. Following the Closing Date, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as those contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Company Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (d) This _Section 8.11_ (i) shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their successors and assigns and (iii) shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. In the event Parent, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any successor or assign (x) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (y) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that such successor or assign, as the case may be, honors the obligations of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, set forth in this _Section 8.11_. 

  

 Section 8.12 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. The Company shall obtain the resignations of all officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent designates in writing, effective as of the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 8.13 _Conditions of the Parent and Merger Sub to Consummate Acquisition_. The obligation of the Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions provided for in this Agreement shall be subject to the fulfillment of the following conditions set forth below, all in form and substance satisfactory to Parent. Parent may, however, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waive the fulfillment of any of these conditions, either before or after the Closing, but any waiver, to be binding upon Parent, must be by a writing duly executed by it. Principal Stockholders shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause each condition set forth in this _Section 8.13_ to be fulfilled. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) The representations and warranties of the Company and the Principal Stockholders herein contained and the information contained in the CompanyÂ’s Disclosure Schedule and the StockholdersÂ’ Disclosure Schedule delivered on the date hereof and in the Related Documents delivered by the Company and the Principal Stockholders shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects at the Closing Date with the same effect as though made at such time (other than those representations and warranties made as of a specific date which would be unreasonable to be brought down to the Closing Date, which representations and warranties shall have been true and correct as of such date) except to the extent waived hereunder or affected by the transactions contemplated herein; the Company and the Principal Stockholders shall have performed all obligations and complied with all agreements, undertakings, covenants and conditions required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by them at or prior to the Closing Date in all material respects; and the Company and the Stockholder Representative shall have delivered to the Parent a certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent dated the Closing Date to all such effects. 

  

 (b) There shall not be any litigation pending or threatened to restrain or invalidate (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) the right of Principal Stockholders or Parent to carry on the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course and consistent with prior practice after the Closing, the defense of which would, in the judgment of the Parent, made in good faith, involve expense or lapse of time or another factor that would be materially adverse to the interests of the Parent. 

  

 (c) There shall not have occurred any events, occurrences, changes, effects or conditions of any character that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (d) Parent shall have been furnished with evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that the Principal Stockholders have obtained the Stockholder Consents and that the Company and its Subsidiaries have obtained the Material Consents and that at the Effective Time all agreements among the Stockholders and/or any holders of Preferred Stock and the Company that relate to Capital Stock (and any rights with respect thereto) shall be terminated, including, but not limited to, those agreements set forth on _Section 8.13_ of the CompanyÂ’s Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (e) All approvals, authorizations or clearances required under any applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Antitrust Filings shall have been obtained and all requirements thereunder shall have been satisfied. 

  

 (f) Stockholders holding not more than 1% of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock (calculated on an as-converted basis) shall have exercised, or have continuing rights to exercise, appraisal or dissentersÂ’ rights under the DGCL with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (g) The Company shall have delivered the Section 382 Study. 

  

 (h) The Company shall have delivered a list, current as of the Closing, of the CompanyÂ’s or its Subsidiaries pending work orders, deliverables and acceptance criteria, other than with respect to continuing maintenance obligations. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (i) The Company shall have delivered to Parent a list of each site where Company Products have been installed. 

  

 (j) All Liens filed in connection with the Comerica Credit Facility shall have been terminated. 

  

 Section 8.14 _Conditions of the Principal Stockholders to Consummate Acquisition_. The obligation of the Principal Stockholders to consummate the transactions provided for in this Agreement shall be subject to the fulfillment of the following conditions set forth below, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative may, however, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waive the fulfillment of any of these conditions, either before or after the Closing, but any waiver, to be binding upon Principal Stockholders, must be by a writing duly executed by the Stockholder Representative. Parent shall exert its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause each condition set forth in this  _Section 8.14_ to be fulfilled. 

  

 (a) The representations and warranties of the Parent and Merger Sub herein contained and the information contained in the ParentÂ’s Disclosure Schedule and the Related Documents delivered by the Parent and Merger Sub shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects at the Closing Date with the same effect as though made at such time (other than those representations and warranties made as of a specific date which would be unreasonable to be brought down to the Closing Date, which representations and warranties shall have been true and correct as of such date); Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed all obligations and complied with all agreements, undertakings, covenants and conditions required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it at or prior to the Closing Date in all material respects; and the Parent shall have delivered to the Stockholder Representative a certificate of the Parent in form and substance satisfactory to the Stockholder Representative dated the Closing Date to all such effects. 

  

 (b) There shall not be any litigation or proceeding pending or threatened to restrain or invalidate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the defense of which would in the judgment of the Principal Stockholders made in good faith, involve expense or lapse of time that would be materially adverse to the interests of the Principal Stockholders. 

  

 (c) Stockholder Representative shall have been furnished with evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that the Parent has obtained the Parent Consents. 

  

 (d) All approvals, authorizations or clearances required under any applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Antitrust Filings shall have been obtained and all requirements thereunder shall have been satisfied. 

  

 (e) Parent shall have delivered the Initial Merger Consideration to the Principal Stockholders or to the Payment Agent, as the case may be, and the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent.

 (c) by Parent if there shall have been any action taken, or any Law enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, by any Governmental Authority which would: (i) prohibit ParentÂ’s ownership or operation of any portion of the business of the Company or (ii) compel Parent or the Company to dispose of or hold separate, as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, any portion of the business or assets of the Company or Parent;

terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(e)_ prior to the earlier of
the Termination Date or the date that is 15 days following ParentÂ’s receipt
of written notice from the Stockholder Representative of such breach, it
being understood that the Stockholder Representative may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_ if such breach by Parent is
cured within such 15-day period so that the conditions would then be
satisfied; 

  

 (f) by Parent if there is a Material Adverse Effect on or prior to the Termination Date; 

  

 (g) by either Parent or the Stockholder Representative if Parent shall have abandoned its efforts to obtain any approval under Antitrust Laws of the transactions contemplated hereby; or

 Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_.
