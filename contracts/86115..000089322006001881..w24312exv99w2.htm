the Stockholder Representative a written notice of disagreement, specifying the items of
disagreement within 10 business days of receipt of the Differential. If Parent agrees with the
Differential, Parent shall reduce the amount of the Merger Consideration payable at Closing by the
amount of the Differential. If Parent timely provides such notice of disagreement, Parent and
Stockholder Representative will negotiate in good faith to resolve the items of dispute. If no
agreement is reached within 10 business days of the Stockholder Representative&#146;s receipt of such
notice of disagreement, the matter shall be referred to an Independent Accounting Firm who shall be
directed to resolve such differences within forty-five (45)&nbsp;days after the matter is referred to it

Indemnified Parties at its own expense. Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this <U>Section&nbsp;8.11(b)</U> upon becoming aware of any such Company
Indemnified Proceeding shall promptly notify Parent (but the failure to so notify Parent shall not
