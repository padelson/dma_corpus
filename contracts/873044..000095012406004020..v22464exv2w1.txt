is in default under or in violation of any provision thereof in any material
respect.  3.2 AUTHORITY AND ENFORCEABILITY.   (a) The board of directors

Agreements and the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly  authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the  Company. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the  Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of  the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its  terms,

creditors\' rights generally and by general equitable  principles. Upon the

preparation  of the Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and 
includes those policies and procedures that (x) pertain to the  maintenance

independent contractor of any Acquired Company  is a party to, or is
otherwise bound by, any Contract, including any  confidentiality, non-

her duties for the Acquired  Companies;   (ii) his or her ability to assign
to any Acquired Company rights to  any invention, improvement, discovery or

Except as set forth in Section 3.14(d) of the Company Disclosure  Schedule,
none of the Acquired Companies are, and none of the  Acquired Companies at
any time within the past five years have been,  parties to any Contract
with:   (i) any Governmental Authority;   (ii) any prime contractor to any
Governmental Authority; or   (iii) any subcontractor with respect to any
Contract described in  clause (i) or (ii).  3.15 TAX MATTERS.   (a)
Except as set forth in Section 3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure  Schedule,
all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies required to be  filed on or before
the Closing Date have been timely filed in  accordance with applicable Laws,
and each such Tax Return is  accurate and complete in all material respects.
Except as set forth  in Section 3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
true and  complete copies of all such Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies 
have been provided by the Company to the Purchaser. Each Acquired  Company
has timely paid all Taxes due with respect to the taxable  periods covered by
such Tax Returns and all other Taxes (whether or  not shown on any Tax
Return). No claim has ever been made by a  Governmental Authority in a
jurisdiction where an Acquired Company  does not file a Tax Return that it is
or may be subject to taxation  by that jurisdiction except for those claims
which, individually or  in the aggregate, have not had, and may not
reasonably be expected  to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
set forth in  Section 3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Acquired  Companies have not requested an extension of time within which to 
file any Tax Return which has not since been filed.   (b) For Taxes where a
Governmental Authority is required to issue an  assessment or other similar
notice (including, without limitation,  income Tax and corporation capital
Tax), Tax assessments by relevant  Governmental Authorities have been issued
to the Acquired Companies  and any predecessor entities covering all past
taxation years and  all Taxes owing in respect of all such assessments have
been paid.  There are no currently outstanding reassessments or questions
that  have been issued or raised by any Governmental Authority relating to 
any Tax Returns of any of the Acquired Companies.   (c) The Acquired
Companies have and will have no Liability for Taxes for  any period on or
before the Closing Date, other than those reflected  as Liabilities in line
items on the Balance Sheet. The amounts  reflected as Liabilities in line
items on the Balance Sheet for all  Taxes are adequate to cover all unpaid
Liabilities for all Taxes,  whether or not disputed, that have accrued with
respect to, or are  applicable to, periods ending on or before the Closing
Date. Since  the date of the Balance Sheet, no Acquired Company has incurred
any  Liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as 
that term is used in U.S. GAAP.   (d) All Taxes that each Acquired Company
is required by Law to deduct,  withhold or collect, including sales and use
Taxes and amounts  required to be withheld or collected in connection with
any amount  paid, credited or owing to any non resident, or any employee, 
independent contractor, creditor, or other third party, have been  duly
deducted, withheld or collected. To the extent required by  applicable Law,
all such amounts have   37    been remitted or paid over to the proper
Governmental Authority or,  to the extent not yet due and payable, are held
in separate bank  accounts for such purpose and designated as such. Without
limiting  the generality of Section 3.15(a), all Tax Returns in respect of 
such Taxes have been filed in accordance with applicable Laws.   (e) No
Acquired Company or director or officer (or employee responsible  for Tax
matters) of any Acquired Company expects any Governmental  Authority to
assess any additional Taxes for any period for which  Tax Returns have been
filed. No federal, provincial, state, local or  foreign audits or other
Proceedings are, to the Knowledge of the  Acquired Companies, pending or
being conducted, nor has any Acquired  Company received any:   (i) notice
from any Governmental Authority that any such audit or  other Proceeding is
pending, threatened or contemplated;   (ii) ruling, subpoena, request for
ruling, request for subpoena or  other request for information related to Tax
matters; or   (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any
amount of  Tax proposed, asserted or assessed by any Governmental  Authority
against any Acquired Company, with respect to any  Taxes due from or with
respect to any Acquired Company or any  Tax Return filed by or with respect
to any Acquired Company.   (f) The Acquired Companies have not granted or
been requested to grant  any waiver of any period for reassessment or of any
statutes of  limitations applicable to any claim for Taxes or with respect to
any  Tax assessment or deficiency.   (g) All material Tax deficiencies that
have been claimed, proposed or  asserted in writing against any Acquired
Company have been fully  paid or finally settled, and no issue has been
raised in writing in  any examination which, by application of similar
principles, could  be expected to result in the proposal or assertion of a
Tax  deficiency for any other year not so examined.   (h) No position has
been taken on any Tax Return with respect to the  business or operations of
any Acquired Company for a taxable period  for which the normal reassessment
period or the statute of  limitations for the assessment of any Taxes with
respect thereto has  not expired that is contrary to any publicly announced
position of a  taxing authority or that is substantially similar to any
position  which a taxing authority has successfully challenged in the
course  of an examination of a Tax Return of any Acquired Company. Each of 
the Acquired Companies has disclosed on their federal income Tax  Returns all
positions taken therein that could give rise to a  substantial understatement
of income Tax under Section 6662 of the  Code.   (i) None of the Acquired
Companies is a party to or bound by any Tax  sharing agreement, Tax
allocation agreement, Tax indemnity  obligation or similar Contract or
practice with respect to Taxes  (including any advance pricing agreement,
closing agreement or other  Contract relating to Taxes with any Governmental
Authority).   (j) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(j) of the Company
Disclosure  Schedule, none of the Acquired Companies is or has been a member
of  an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the  Code
(or any similar group defined under a similar provision of   38   
foreign, state or local Law), other than a group of which the  Company is the
common parent. None of the Acquired Companies  has any Liability for Taxes of
any other Person whether  pursuant to Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury
Regulations (or  any similar provision of foreign, state or local Law) or 
Section 160 of the Canadian Tax Act or otherwise as a  transferee or
successor, by Contract or otherwise.   (k) None of the Acquired Companies is
or has been a United States  real property holding corporation (as defined in
Section  897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified  in
Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.   (l) There are no Encumbrances for
Taxes upon any properties or  assets of any Acquired Company (other than
Encumbrances  relating to Taxes not yet due and payable and for which 
adequate reserves have been recorded in line items on the  Balance
Sheet).   (m) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(m) of the Company 
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Acquired Companies has made,  revoked or
rescinded any Tax election, or made, revoked or  rescinded any settlement or
compromise of any Liability with  respect to Taxes, or amended or refiled any
Tax Return.   (n) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(n) of the Company 
Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of the Company each  Company
Securityholder is resident of Canada within the  meaning of the Canadian Tax
Act and is not a non-resident of  Canada for purposes of section 116 of such
Act.   (o) The residence of each Acquired Company for Tax purposes is set 
out below:   (i) the Company is resident in Canada;   (ii) Convedia Inc.
is resident in Delaware; and   (iii) Convedia Ltd. is resident in England
and Wales.   (p) The tax accounts of the Acquired Companies, as disclosed
in  Section 3.15(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule are true  and
complete in all respects.   (q) All Company Plans have been duly registered
where required by,  and are in good standing in all material respects under,
all  applicable Laws including, without limiting the generality of  the
foregoing, the Canadian Tax Act and all required employer  contributions
under any such Company Plans have been made and  the applicable funds have
been funded in accordance with the  terms thereof and no past service funding
liabilities exist  thereunder.   (r) None of the Acquired Companies has
participated in any listed  or reportable transaction under Section 6011 of
the Code, or  any similar provision of state, local or foreign Laws.   (s)
The Company has been a Canadian-controlled private corporation  (as defined
in the Canadian Tax Act) at all times since its  incorporation through until
March 31, 2006.   39   3.16 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS.   (a) Section

complete list of all Company Plans and identifies each  such Company Plan

determination letter issued by any trustee, auditor or  Governmental

with  respect to any Company Plan and, if no such written report  exists, a
written description of any such analysis that has  been performed.   (c) No

an obligation to maintain or contribute to, any:   40    (i)
Multiemployer Plan;   (ii) Pension Plan;   (iii) voluntary employees\'
beneficiary association;   (iv) welfare benefit fund;   (v) self-insured
plan (including any plan pursuant to which a  stop-loss policy or contract

arrangement  that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of 
which are not under common control.   (d) No Acquired Company provides
health or welfare benefits for any  retired or former employee, or their

Plan is and at all times has been maintained, funded,  operated and
administered, and the Acquired Companies have performed  all of their
obligations under each Company Plan, in each case in  accordance with the
terms of such Company Plan and in compliance in  all material respects with
all applicable Laws. Each Company Plan  that provides deferred compensation

reflected in line items on  the Balance Sheet. All returns, reports and
filings required by any  Governmental Authority or which must be furnished to
any Person with  respect to each Company Plan have been filed or

to any  Company Plan, including any Liability imposed by statute. All 
contributions and payments made or accrued with respect to all  Company Plans
are deductible. There is no unfunded Liability under  any Company Plan. No

under any Company Plan otherwise with respect to,  any director, officer,
employee, or former director, former  officer or former employee of any
Acquired Company. No  Acquired Company has made or has become obligated to
make, and  no Acquired Company will as a result of the consummation of  the

(or  any corresponding provision of foreign, state or local Law),  nor will

prepared (and furnish to the Purchaser and the Parent) as promptly as
possible (and in any event before the 15th day of the following month) on a
monthly basis unaudited consolidated balance sheets as of the end of the
previous calendar month, and the related unaudited consolidated statements of
operations, statements of shareholders\' equity and statements of cash flows
for the respective one-month periods (such balance sheets, and related
statements being collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "UNAUDITED
MONTHLY STATEMENTS"). The Unaudited Monthly Statements will be prepared from
the books and records of the Company and will fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations and
changes in cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of
and for the respective time periods in accordance with internal Company
accounting methods and standards currently used.   56   5.12 STRUCTURE
CHANGES.   In the event that the Court issues any order (including the
Interim Order or Final Order), ruling, decision or decree, or takes any
action of any kind whatsoever, or refuses to take any action which is
contemplated by this Agreement to be taken by it in connection with the
implementation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which is inconsistent
with the structure of the transactions contemplated hereby or is not in
accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement or the Plan of
Arrangement, the Purchaser shall have the right to propose an alternative
structure for the acquisition of all of the outstanding Shares, Company
Options and other securities of the Company which will result in all of the
Company Securityholders being, as nearly as practicable and in all material
respects, in the same economic position, or in better economic positions, as
they would have been if the structure provided herein for the transactions
contemplated hereby had been implemented, and which shall not be materially
detrimental to the Company, and the Parties shall amend this Agreement and
the Plan of Arrangement to the extent necessary to reflect such changes in
the proposed structure, and to implement the transactions contemplated hereby
as so amended. For greater certainty, any amendment of this Agreement or the
Plan of Arrangement which provides any additional right to any Company
Securityholder, including but not limited to (a) the provision of dissent
rights to any or all Company Securityholders; (b) the provision of notice
with respect to the Company Meeting which is in excess of the
notice requirements in the articles and bylaws of the Company; (c) the
extension of the time period for the extinction of rights of any holder of
Shares or Company Options under Section 5.3 of the Plan of Arrangement; and
(d) the provision of class voting rights to any group of Company
Securityholders, shall be deemed to result in all of the Company
Securityholders being, as nearly as practicable and in all material respects,
in the same economic position, or in better economic positions, as they would
have been if the structure provided herein for the transactions contemplated
hereby had been implemented, and shall be deemed to not be materially
detrimental to the Company.  5.13 FURTHER ACTIONS.   Subject to the other

Party, the other Parties will:   (a) furnish to the requesting Party any
additional information;   (b) execute and deliver, at their own expense, any

AGREEMENTS  7.1 NOTICE AND CURE PROVISIONS   (a) Each Party will give
prompt notice to the other Parties of the  occurrence, or failure to occur,
at any time from the date hereof  until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement and  the Effective Time of any event or state
of facts which would  require notice under Section 5.7.   60    (b) No
Party may elect not to complete the transactions contemplated  hereby
pursuant to the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2 or  exercise any
termination right arising therefrom unless forthwith  and in any event prior
to the Effective Time, the Party intending to  rely thereon has delivered a
written notice to the other Party  specifying in reasonable detail all
breaches of covenants,  representations and warranties or other matters which
the Party  delivering such notice is asserting as the basis for the  non-
fulfillment or the applicable condition or termination right, as  the case
may be. If any such notice is delivered, provided that a  Party is proceeding
diligently to cure such matter and such matter  is capable of being cured
(except matters arising out of the failure  of the Company to make
appropriate disclosure), no Party may  terminate this Agreement until the
expiration of a period of 5  Business Days from such notice, if such matter
has not been cured by  such date. If such notice has been delivered prior to
the date of  the Company Meeting, such meeting shall, unless the Parties
agree  otherwise, be postponed or adjourned until the expiry of such 
period. If such notice has been delivered prior to the filing of the 
Articles of Arrangement with the Director, such filing shall be  postponed
until two Business Days after the expiry of such period.   (c) Each Party
shall promptly notify the other party of (i) any  communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such  Person (or another Person) is or
may be required in connection with  the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response  thereto from such Party, its Subsidiaries or its
representatives),  (ii) any material communication from any Governmental
Authority in  connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and  the response thereto from such Party, its Subsidiaries or its 
representatives), and (iii) any material Proceedings threatened or  commenced
against or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its  Subsidiaries that
are related to the transactions contemplated by  the Agreement.  7.2 NON-
SOLICITATION   During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall not,
directly or indirectly, and shall not authorize, permit or condone any
officer, director, employee, representative or agent of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly to (i) solicit, initiate, induce,
facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or
entering into any form of agreement, arrangement or understanding) the
initiation of any inquiries or making of any proposals or announcements
regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than the Parent, the Purchaser and their
respective Affiliates and representatives) regarding an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the Purchaser, the
approval of the board of directors of the Company of the Arrangement, (iv)
approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) accept or enter into any
agreement, understanding, arrangement or Contract in respect of
an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause the
officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, immediately terminate any existing solicitations,
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the Purchaser and the
Parent) that has made, indicated any interest to make or may reasonably be
expected to make, an Acquisition Proposal.   The Company shall promptly
(and in any event within 48 hours of receipt by the Company) notify the
Parent, immediately orally and thereafter in writing, of any Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry received after the date hereof (whether or not relating
to any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry received prior to the date hereof)
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each
case received after the date hereof, of which any of its directors, officers,
Financial Advisor or other agents are   61   or become aware, or any
amendments to the foregoing, or any request for non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal and a description of the material terms and conditions
of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall keep the
Parent informed of any change to the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.  7.3 RIGHT TO MATCH   (a) The Company
covenants and agrees that for a period of six (6) months  after the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(b)  or 8.2(c) it will
not accept, approve, recommend or enter into any  agreement, understanding,
arrangement or Contract in respect of an  Acquisition Proposal unless:  
(i) the Company has promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of  receipt by
the Company) notified the Parent, orally and  thereafter in writing, of any
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry  received (whether or not relating to any
Acquisition Proposal  or inquiry received) that could reasonably be expected
to lead  to an Acquisition Proposal, of which any of its directors, 
officers, Financial Advisor or other agents are or become  aware, or any
amendments to the foregoing, or any request for  non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or for  access to the properties, books or records of
the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries by any Person in connection with an 
Acquisition Proposal and a description of the material terms  and conditions
of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry,  and thereafter the Company
shall keep the Parent informed of  any change to the material terms of any
such Acquisition  Proposal or inquiry; and   (ii) a period (the "RESPONSE
PERIOD") of ten (10) Business Days  shall have elapsed from the date on which
the Parent received  written notice from the board of directors of the
Company that  the board of directors of the Company determined, subject
only  to compliance with this Section 7.3, to accept, approve,  recommend or
enter into a binding agreement to proceed with  the Acquisition Proposal.  
(b) During the Response Period, the Purchaser and the Parent will have 
right, but not the obligation, to offer to match the terms of the 
Acquisition Proposal (the "MATCHING PROPOSAL"). The Company shall  enter into
an agreement with the Purchaser and/or the Parent  implementing the Matching
Proposal as soon as reasonably practicable  after the Company\'s receipt from
the Purchaser or Parent of such  Matching Proposal.   (c) Each successive
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that results  in an increase in, or
modification of, the consideration (or value  of such consideration) to be
received by the holders of securities  of the Company shall constitute a new
Acquisition Proposal for the  purposes of this Section 7.3 and the Purchaser
and the Parent shall  be afforded a new Response Period in respect of each
such  Acquisition Proposal.  7.4 TRANSACTION EXPENSES; ESTIMATED CLOSING
BALANCE SHEET.   (a) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the  Company shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser and the
Parent a  good faith written estimate of the Closing Date   62   
Transaction Expenses incurred (whether or not paid) by the Acquired 
Companies as of the Closing Date, which shall indicate for each cost  or
expense itemized therein the payee thereof. An invoice or account  from each
applicable payee shall accompany the estimate, together  with a written
statement that such Closing Date Transaction Expenses  are all of the Closing
Date Transaction Expenses such third party  reasonably expects to be incurred
by the Acquired Companies in  connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;  provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing
Date  Transaction Expenses shall not include any fees or expenses incurred 
by and that may become payable by the Company to the Financial  Advisor in
respect of the payment of the Final Consideration.   (b) The Company shall
also prepare and deliver to the Purchaser and the  Parent at least three (3)
Business Days before the Closing Date an  unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Acquired Companies  prepared on an estimated basis as of the
close of business on the  Closing Date (the "ESTIMATED CLOSING BALANCE
SHEET"). The Estimated  Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP  in a manner consistent with the methods and practices used
to  prepare the Balance Sheet. The Company will deliver with the  Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet:   (i) a statement setting forth the Company\'s
calculation of the Net  Working Capital on an estimated basis as of the close
of  business on the Closing Date, based on the Estimated Closing  Balance
Sheet (the "ESTIMATED NET WORKING CAPITAL"); and   (ii) a certification that
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet is  being delivered in good faith and
pursuant to this Section 7.4  and fairly presents the Estimated Net Working
Capital of the  Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date.   The statement
setting forth the Company\'s calculation of the  Estimated Net Working
Capital shall be acceptable to the Purchaser  and the Parent, acting
reasonably.  7.5 NATURE AND SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND
INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF   (a) All representations, warranties and covenants
contained in this  Agreement on the part of each of the Parties shall survive
the  Closing, the Effective Time and the payment of the Purchase Price. 
There shall be no merger of any representation, warranty or covenant  set
forth herein with any of the documents, instruments or  certificates required
to be delivered at Closing or deemed to be  transferred pursuant to the Plan
of Arrangement.   (b) The Parties agree that following Closing the sole and
exclusive  remedy of any Party in respect of any misrepresentation, 
incorrectness in or breach of any representation or warranty, or  breach of
any covenant, by another Party or Parties shall be under  the Indemnification
and Escrow Agreement.   (c) Nothing contained herein shall preclude a Party
from seeking  injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach
of the  covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the 
Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific  performance of any
of such acts, covenants or agreements, without  the necessity of posting a
bond or security in connection therewith.   63   7.6 INDEMNIFICATION OF
DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY   (a) From the Closing Date through
the sixth anniversary of the Closing  Date, the Purchaser and the Parent
shall cause the Company to  indemnify and hold harmless each Person who has
been at any time  prior to the Closing Date, a director or officer of the
Company or  any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "COMPANY INDEMNIFIED 
PARTIES"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,  judgments,
fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including  attorneys\' fees
and disbursements (collectively, "COSTS", incurred  in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or  investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or  investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the  Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the 
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed  prior to, at
or after the Closing Date, to the fullest extent  permitted under the CBCA
for officers and directors of such  corporations and to the extent required
under the constating  documents of such company (or applicable legislation
with respect to  any subsidiary).   (b) Subject to the next sentence, the
Purchaser and the Parent shall  cause the Company to maintain, at no expense
to the beneficiaries,  in effect for three years from the Closing Date the
current policies  of the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
maintained by  the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or  prior to the Closing Date so long as the annual premium therefor  would
not be in excess of 150% of the annual premium paid by the  Company in its
most recent fiscal year, which premium is set forth  in Section 7.6(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (150% of such  annual premium, the "MAXIMUM
PREMIUM"). If the Company\'s existing  insurance expires, is terminated or
cancelled or cannot be renewed  during such three-year period or the annual
premium therefor exceeds  the Maximum Premium, the Purchaser and the Parent
shall cause the  Company to obtain such directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance  as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an 
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on such  terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Company Indemnified  Parties than the
Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\'  liability insurance or as
favourable as is then available. The  provisions of this Section 7.6(b) shall
be deemed to have been  satisfied if the Purchaser and the Parent, with the
cooperation of  the Company, or the Company obtains an extension of the
existing  policy, a run-off endorsement or other prepaid policies prior to
the  Closing for purposes of this Section 7.6. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement, any expenses  and
premiums relating to the foregoing insurance policy or policies  (including
any extension of the existing directors\' and officers\'  liability insurance
policy, a run-off endorsement or other prepaid  policies obtained prior to
the Closing as contemplated above) shall  not be treated as a Closing Date
Transaction Expense or Post-Closing  Transaction Expense, to the extent
previously approved by the  Purchaser.  7.7 POST-CLOSING COVENANTS   (a)
Following the completion of the transactions contemplated by the  Arrangement
Agreement and until the Final Consideration, if any, is  paid to the Company
Securityholders in accordance with the Plan of  Arrangement and the
Indemnification and Escrow Agreement (the  "EARN-OUT PERIOD"), the Purchaser
and the Parent covenant and agree  to operate the business of the Acquired
Companies in a manner  consistent with the   64    Purchaser\'s and the
Parent\'s reasonable business judgment, but not  inconsistent with the
covenants and agreements contained in this  Agreement.   (b) During the
Earn-Out Period, the Purchaser and the Parent will act in  good faith in
connection with the operation of the business of the  Acquired Companies. In
that regard, the Purchaser and the Parent  will:   (i) keep books and
records in relation to the business of the  Acquired Companies which are
accurate and complete in all  material respects, so as to allow for the
calculation and  verification of Actual Gross Profit Dollars (as such term
is  defined in the Plan of Arrangement); and   (ii) consult in good faith
with management of the business of the  Acquired Companies in connection with
the development of an  amended management plan based on the Management Plan
of the  Acquired Companies, but with all such revisions which may be 
reasonably necessary or desirable so as to leverage the  combination of the
business of the Acquired Companies with the  businesses of the Parent and its
Affiliates and to realize  potential efficiencies that arise therefrom, with
a view to  achieving the amount of Final Consideration.   (c) The Parties
agree that any changes in the U.S. GAAP accounting rules  after the Effective
Date shall not affect the calculation of the  amount of the Actual Gross
Profit Dollars or Final Consideration  and, for greater certainty, the
calculation of the Actual Gross  Profit Dollars and Final Consideration shall
be made in accordance  with the U.S. GAAP accounting rules, regulations and
standards in  effect on the Effective Date applied in a manner consistent
with the  past practice of the Acquired Companies.   (d) In the event of a
Sale of the Parent, the Purchaser and/or any of  the Acquired Companies
during the Earn-Out Period, the Parent and  the Purchaser agree that, at the
discretion of the Representative,  the Final Consideration shall be deemed to
equal $10,000,000 and  upon the closing of such Sale transaction or at any
time thereafter  the Representative may declare the Final Consideration to
be  immediately due and payable, and such amount shall forthwith become  due
and payable in accordance with the payment regime set forth in  the
Indemnification and Escrow Agreement. For purposes of the  foregoing, "SALE"
shall mean, in respect of any one or more of the  Parent, the Purchaser
and/or any of the Acquired Companies: (i) a  voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of  the affairs of the relevant
corporation; or (ii) the sale of all or  substantially all of the
corporation\'s property and assets or the  acquisition of the corporation by
another entity (including, without  limitation, any reorganization, merger,
amalgamation, arrangement or  consolidation) resulting in the exchange of all
of the outstanding  shares of the corporation for securities issued or
other  consideration paid, by the acquiring entity or any affiliate thereof 
in a single transaction or a series of related transactions (except  for a
transaction or series of related transactions after the  consummation of
which the shareholders of the corporation own at  least 51% of the voting
securities of the surviving corporation or  its parent corporation or a
subsidiary thereof). For greater  certainty, a "Sale" shall not include any
bona fide restructuring or  reorganization of the Parent, the Purchaser
and/or any of the  Acquired Companies, including but not limited to an
amalgamation of  the Purchaser and the Company after the Effective Time.

resulted in, the failure of the Required Vote to be  obtained at the Company

Shareholder), or  group of Persons acting together in concert, shall have
become  the beneficial owner of 33-1/3% or more of the outstanding  Shares
(either on a primary or diluted basis);   (ii) subject to compliance with
Section 7.1, if Purchaser and the  Parent are not in material breach of their
respective  obligations under this Agreement and the Company breaches any

set forth in Section 6.1(a) or  Section 6.1(b);   (iii) if the Company

representations, warranties, covenants or  agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach would give rise  to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section  6.2(b).   (e) Effect of Termination. If
this Agreement is terminated in accordance  with the foregoing provisions of
this Section 8.2, this Agreement  shall forthwith become void and of no
further force or effect and no  Party shall have any further obligations
hereunder except as  provided in Article 10, Section 5.12, Section 7.3,

Agreement or as  otherwise expressly contemplated hereby, and further
provided that  neither the termination of this Agreement nor anything
contained in  this Section 8.2 shall relieve any Party from any liability for
any  fraud or willful misconduct. If this Agreement is terminated by a 
Party because of the breach of this Agreement by another Party or  because
one or more of the conditions to the terminating Party\'s  obligations under
this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the  other Party\'s failure to
comply with its obligations under this  Agreement, the terminating Party\'s
right to pursue all legal  remedies will survive such termination
unimpaired.   (f) Automatic Termination. If the Effective Time has not
occurred prior  to 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on October 31, 2006, this
Agreement  shall automatically terminate at 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on 
October 31, 2006, without any further act or formality required on  the part
of any Person.  8.3 AMENDMENT   This Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement
may, at any time and from time to time before or after the holding of the
Company Meeting but not later than the Effective Time, be amended by mutual
written agreement of the Parties. In addition, the Plan of Arrangement may be
amended as provided for therein. For greater certainty, nothing in this
Section 8.3 or in the Plan of Arrangement shall affect or hinder the
operation of Section 5.12 of this Agreement.  8.4 WAIVER   The Purchaser
or the Parent may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the Company, (ii) waive compliance, except as provided
herein, with any of the Company\'s agreements or the fulfillment of
any conditions to its own obligations contained herein, or (iii) waive
inaccuracies in any of the Company\'s representations or warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered by the Company; provided, however, that
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Purchaser or the Parent and,
unless otherwise provided in the written waiver, will be limited to the
specific breach or condition waived.   The Company may (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the Purchaser or the
Parent, (ii) waive compliance, except as provided herein, with any of the
Purchaser\'s or the Parent\'s agreements or the fulfillment of any conditions
to its own obligations contained herein, or (iii) waive inaccuracies in any
of the Purchaser\'s or the Parent\'s representations or warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered by the Purchaser or the Parent; provided,
however, that any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Company and, unless
otherwise provided in the written waiver, will be limited to the specific
breach or condition waived.   67    No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement or any of the documents
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and no course of dealing between the
parties, operates as a waiver of such right or remedy, and no single or
partial exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other or further
exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or
remedy.   ARTICLE 9  CERTAIN TAX MATTERS  9.1 TAX MATTERS   During the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall:   (a) prepare and timely file all material Tax
Returns required to be  filed by them before the Effective Time ("PRE-CLOSING
Returns") in a  manner consistent, in all material respects, with past
practice,  except as otherwise required by applicable Laws;   (b) fully and
timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such  Pre-Closing Returns
that are so filed; and   (c) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in
their books and  records and financial statements) or pay any instalment or
deposit  required, for all Taxes payable by them for which no Pre-Closing 
Return is due prior to the Effective Time in a manner consistent  with past
practice.  9.2 TAX ELECTIONS.   The Company will not, and will not cause
or permit any Acquired Company to, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make
or revoke, or cause or permit to be made or revoked, any Tax election
pertaining to any Acquired Company or the ownership of the Shares.  9.3
TRANSACTIONAL TAXES.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, all transfer, documentary, recording, notarial, sales, use,
registration, stamp and other similar Taxes or fees imposed by any taxing
authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will be borne by the Company Securityholders. All necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Taxes will be the responsibility
of the Company Securityholders and will be prepared and filed at their own
expense and, if required by applicable Law, the Purchaser will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or
other documentation.  9.4 CLEARANCE CERTIFICATES.   The Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate Company Securityholders who are
non-residents of Canada for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act to obtain
appropriate clearance certificates pursuant to Section 116 of the Canadian
Tax Act.   68   9.5 WITHHOLDING TAX.   Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained herein, the Company, the Purchaser, the Parent and the
Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable to any Company Securityholder, such amounts as the Company,
the Purchaser, the Parent or the Depositary is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under the Canadian Tax Act, the Code or
any provision of federal, provincial, state, local or foreign tax Laws, in
each case, as amended or succeeded. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having
been paid to the Company Securityholder in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.   The Purchaser and the
Company Securityholders shall use commercially reasonable efforts to as soon
as reasonably practicable provide to the Escrow Agent (as defined in the
Indemnification and Escrow Agreement) or Depositary, as applicable, such
information or tax forms as the Escrow Agent or Depositary reasonably
requests in connection with its obligations under the appropriate tax laws
and/or regulations applicable in respect of withholding, backup
withholding and information reporting including, without limitation, tax
identification numbers (if any) for any Purchaser Indemnified Party (as
defined in the Indemnification and Escrow Agreement), the Representative and
each of the Company Securityholders and Forms W-9 or W-8. Any amount deducted
or withheld pursuant to section 116 of the Canadian Tax Act from any Company
Securityholder who is a non-resident of Canada or has not certified that he
is resident in Canada for income tax purposes (a "NON-RESIDENT HOLDER") shall
be remitted either (a) to the relevant taxing authority on the last business
day of the period within which remittance is required or (b) to such Non-
Resident Holder upon delivery by such Non-Resident Holder to the Purchaser of
a clearance certificate acceptable to the Purchaser, acting reasonably,
issued pursuant to section 116 of the Canadian Tax Act having a certificate
limit not less than the full amount of the consideration to be paid to such
Non-Resident Holder pursuant to the terms hereof, whichever shall first
occur. Notwithstanding that the time for remittance of amounts deducted or
withheld in respect of any such Non-Resident Holder has occurred without an
acceptable clearance certificate being provided to the Purchaser, if the
Purchaser is provided with a letter acceptable to the Purchaser, acting
reasonably, from CRA advising that all or any portion (the "PORTION") of the
amounts deducted or withheld pursuant to section 116 of the Canadian Tax Act
in respect of such Non-Resident Holder is not required to be remitted at that
time, such Portion will continue to be held in accordance with that letter
until such a clearance certificate is provided or until CRA requires the
Portion to be remitted, whichever shall first occur.  9.6 TAX RETURNS  
The Purchaser shall prepare and file all Tax Returns relating to the Acquired
Companies for Tax Periods ending after the Effective Time.   In the case of
any Tax imposed upon or measured by income or receipts, to the extent
required, Taxes shall be apportioned between taxable periods ending on or
before the Effective Date and the portion of any Straddle Period (as defined
below) ending on the Effective Date (a "PRE-CLOSING TAX PERIOD") and taxable
periods beginning after the Effective Date and the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning after the Effective Date (a "POST-CLOSING TAX PERIOD") on
the basis of a closing of the books using the Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' normal methods of accounting as determined under section 446
of the Code.   69    In the case of any Tax for any taxable period
beginning before and ending after the Effective Date (the "STRADDLE PERIOD")
which is not imposed upon or measured by income or receipts, to the extent
required, the amount of such Tax which is allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
portion of such taxable period ending on the Effective Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period. The
amount of such Tax which is allocable to the portion of the tax period
beginning after the Effective Date shall be the amount of Tax for the entire
taxable period less the amount of such Tax which is allocable to a Pre-
closing Tax Period.   The Purchaser shall prepare all U.S. Tax Returns
consistent with the proration of Taxes in this Section 9.6.  9.7 CLOSING
DATE TAX RETURNS   For greater certainty, no Tax Return for any Acquired
Company for any Tax Period ending on or before the Effective Time which is
not required to be filed until after the Effective Time will be prepared or
filed without the prior written approval of the Purchaser and the Parent.

be governed, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws
of the Province of British Columbia and the laws of Canada applicable
therein, and shall be construed and treated in all respects as a British
Columbia contract. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of British Columbia in
respect of all matters arising under and in relation to this Agreement
and the Arrangement. Each Party to this Agreement hereby waives any right to
trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or the actions of the Parties in
the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this
Agreement.   71   10.3 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   The Parties agree that
irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy at
law. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement, any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief hereby being waived.  10.4 TIME OF ESSENCE   Time shall
be of the essence in this Agreement.  10.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT, BINDING EFFECT
AND ASSIGNMENT   Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations under
this Agreement shall be assignable by operation of law, amalgamation or
otherwise by any Party without the prior written consent of each of the other
Parties, except that the Purchaser may assign, without being required to
obtain consent of the Company, all or part of its rights or obligations
hereunder, including the rights to acquire the Shares, without reducing its
own obligations hereunder, to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of the Parent provided such Subsidiary delivers to the Company
an instrument in writing executed by the Subsidiary confirming that it is
bound by and shall perform all of the obligations of the Purchaser under this
Agreement as if it were an original signatory. Subject thereto, this
Agreement shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. No third party shall have
any rights hereunder unless expressly stated to the contrary.   This
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, together with the agreements,
instruments and other documents required to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties and set
out all the covenants, promises, warranties, representations,
conditions, understandings and agreements between the Parties pertaining to
the subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written, including the letter of intent dated June 2, 2006,
as amended, between the Company and the Parent. No reliance has been made or
will be placed upon any covenant, promise, warranty, representation, opinion,
advice or assertion of fact made either prior to, contemporaneously with, or
after entering into this Agreement or any amendment or supplement thereto, by
any Party to this Agreement or its directors, officers, employees or agents,
to any other Party to this Agreement or its directors, officers, employees or
agents, except to the extent that the same has been reduced to writing and
included as a term of this Agreement or the agreements, instruments and other
documents required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and none of
the Parties to this Agreement has been induced to enter into this Agreement
or any amendment or supplement by reason of any such warranty,
representation, opinion, advice or assertion of fact (except those forming
part of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or forming part of
any agreement, instrument or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder). Accordingly, there shall be no liability, either in tort or in
contract, assessed in relation to any such warranty, representation, opinion,
advice or assertion of fact, except to the extent contemplated
herein.  10.6 SEVERABILITY.   If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in
any way   72   and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to
replace such invalid, illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal
and enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under
this Agreement, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision.  10.7 SCHEDULES.   The Schedules to
this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule are arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to

Shares pursuant to the Arrangement and (i) the rights of the holders of
Company Options to receive the consideration in respect of their Company
Options pursuant to the Arrangement, which rights are hereby acknowledged and
agreed by the Purchaser and the Parent, this Agreement is not intended to
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties to this
Agreement.  10.9 INTERPRETATION.   The language used in this Agreement is
the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted for or against any party
because that party or its attorney drafted the provision.  10.10
COUNTERPARTS.   The Parties may execute this Agreement in multiple
counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the Party that
signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This Agreement
is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each Party to the
other Parties. The signatures of all Parties need not appear on the same
counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email
transmission that includes a copy of the sending Party\'s signature is as
effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.   [SIGNATURE

through (c) above.  For purposes of determining under this Section 2.1
whether there is any inaccuracy in, or whether any of the Acquired Companies
has breached, any such representation, warranty or covenant, and the amount
of any Losses associated therewith, the parties agree:   (a) that all
references to "material," "materially" or "materiality," or  to whether a
breach would have a material adverse effect, Company  Material Adverse
Effect, or result in a material adverse change,  will be disregarded; and  
(b) that the representations, warranties and covenants are made for  purposes

purposes of this Section 2.2 as if those disregarded words were not

Section 2, if the Indemnified  Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party and the
payment for such  indemnification is sought against the Escrow Fund at any
time or  times before the Second Release Time (as defined in Section 6(c)), 
then the parties shall comply with Section 9 rather than this  Section
2.3.   (b) A party that seeks indemnity under this Section 2 (an
"INDEMNIFIED  PARTY") will give written notice (a "CLAIM NOTICE") to the
party  from whom indemnification is sought (an "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") 
containing:   (i) a description and, if known, the estimated amount of any 
Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the  Indemnified
Party;   (ii) a reasonable explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice
to  the extent of the facts then known by the Indemnified Party;  and  
(iii) a demand for payment of such Losses.   (c) Within thirty (30) days
after receipt of a Claim Notice, the  Indemnifying Party will deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written  response in which the Indemnifying Party will
either:   (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive 
indemnification for all of the Losses at issue in the Claim  Notice; or  
(ii) dispute in good faith the Indemnified Party\'s entitlement to 
indemnification by delivering to the Indemnified Party a  written notice (an
"OBJECTION NOTICE") setting forth in  reasonable detail each disputed item
and the basis for  disputing each such item.   (d) If the Indemnifying
Party fails to take either of the actions set  forth in Section 2.3(c) above
within thirty (30) days after receipt  of the Claim Notice, then the
Indemnifying Party will be deemed to  have irrevocably accepted the Claim
Notice and the Indemnifying  Party will be deemed to have irrevocably agreed
to pay the  Indemnified Party the amount of all Losses claimed in the Claim 
Notice.   (e) If the Indemnifying Party delivers an Objection Notice to
the  Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim 
Notice, then the dispute may be resolved by any legally available  means
consistent with the provisions of Section 16(d).   (f) Subject to Section
2.3(g), any indemnification of the Purchaser  Indemnified Parties pursuant to
this Agreement will be effected by  certified cheque or wire transfer of
immediately available funds to  an account designated by the relevant
Purchaser Indemnified Parties.  Any   4    indemnification of the
Company Securityholders pursuant to this  Agreement will be effected by
certified cheque or wire transfer of  immediately available funds to an
account designated by the  Representative for delivery to the Company
Securityholders. All  indemnification payments to be paid by the Company
Securityholders  in accordance with this Agreement will be allocated among
the  Company Securityholders pro rata in accordance with the percentage 
allocations as set forth in Schedule "H". All indemnification  payments to be
received by the Company Securityholders in accordance  with this Agreement
will be allocated among the Company  Securityholders pro rata in accordance
with the percentage  allocations as set forth in Schedule "G".   (g)
Payment in respect of indemnification in accordance with this  Section 2 will
be made within five (5) Business Days after the date  on which:   (i) the
amount of such payments are determined by mutual agreement  of the
Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties;   (ii) if an Objection
Notice has not been timely delivered in  accordance with Section 2.3(c), the
amount of such payments  are determined pursuant to Section 2.3(d); or  
(iii) a written decision of any court of competent jurisdiction has  been
rendered in relation to the disputed claim (which  decision may include an
order for costs).   (h) For purposes of this Section 2.3 and Section 2.4, if
the Company  Securityholders comprise the Indemnifying Party:   (i) any
references to the Indemnifying Party (except provisions  relating to an
obligation to make or a right to receive any  payments) will be deemed to
refer to the Representative; and   (ii) any references to the Indemnified
Party (except provisions  relating to an obligation to make or a right to
receive any  payments) will be deemed to refer to the Representative.  2.4
Third Party Claims   (a) Without limiting the general application of the
other provisions of  this Agreement, if a claim is made by a Person not a
party to the  Arrangement Agreement (other than a Company Securityholder)
against  an Indemnified Party alleging Losses in connection with or arising 
out of a matter for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to be 
indemnified pursuant to this Section 2 (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), the 
Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnification for those  Losses
arising out of the Third Party Claim under, pursuant to and  subject to the
limitations contained in this Agreement, including,  without limitation, the
limitations contained in Sections 2.5, 2.6  and 2.7. If the Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification pursuant to  this Agreement in connection with a Third
Party Claim, the  Indemnified Party will include in the applicable Claim
Notice or  Escrow Claim Notice (as defined in Section 9(b)), as the case
may  be, delivered to the Indemnifying Party notice, to the extent known, 
of the basis of and the amount of damages claimed in such Third  Party Claim
within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party has  received written
notice of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, no delay or
deficiency on the part of the Indemnified   5    Party in so notifying
the Indemnifying Party will relieve the  Indemnifying Party of any Liability
(as defined in the Arrangement  Agreement) or obligation under this Agreement
except to the extent  the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual Losses
directly caused by  the delay or other deficiency.   (b) Where the Company
Securityholders comprise the Indemnifying Parties,  the Representative shall
be entitled, at the expense of the Company  Securityholders, to participate
in any defence of such Third Party  Claim. The Purchaser shall have the right
to control the defence and  shall have the right in its sole discretion to
settle any such  claim; provided, however, that except with the consent of
the  Representative, the settlement of a Third Party Claim shall not be 
determinative of the amount of any claim against the Escrow Fund. In  the
event that the Representative has consented to any such  settlement and
acknowledged that the claim is a valid claim against  the Escrow Fund, the
Representative shall have no power or authority  to object under any
provision of this Agreement to the amount of any  claim by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party against the Escrow Fund with  respect to such settlement,
and amounts paid or payable under such  settlement shall be Losses that the
Indemnifying Party owes to the  Indemnified Party under this Agreement. The
Indemnifying Party will  not agree to any compromise or settlement of, or the
entry of any  Judgment (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement) arising
from, any  Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the 
Indemnified Party, which consent the Indemnified Party will not  unreasonably
withhold or delay. The Indemnified Party will have no  Liability with respect
to any compromise or settlement of, or the  entry of any Judgment arising
from, any Third Party Claim effected  without its consent. The Indemnifying
Party agrees to pay to the  Indemnified Party promptly upon demand from time
to time all  reasonable attorneys\' fees and other costs and expenses of
defence.   (c) Where the Company Securityholders comprise the Indemnifying
Parties,  the Purchaser will reasonably advise the Representative of the 
status of any Third Party Claim and the defence thereof and will  consider in
good faith recommendations made by the Representative.  The Representative
and the Company Securityholders will furnish the  Purchaser with such
information as it or they may have with respect  to such Third Party Claim
(including copies of any summons,  complaint or other pleading which may have
been served on such party  and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or
other document  evidencing or asserting the same) and will otherwise
cooperate,  acting reasonably, with and at the request of the Purchaser
assist  the Purchaser in the defence of such Third Party Claim, at the 
expense of the Purchaser.   (d) Subject to Section 2.6(a) but
notwithstanding any other provisions  of this Agreement, if a Person not a
party to the Arrangement  Agreement (other than a Company Securityholder)
asserts that a  Purchaser Indemnified Party is liable to such third party for
a  monetary or other obligation which individually may constitute or  result
in Losses not to exceed $50,000 for which the Purchaser  Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this  Agreement, and such Purchaser
Indemnified Party reasonably  determines that it has a valid business reason
to fulfill such  obligation, then:   (i) the Purchaser Indemnified Party
will be entitled to satisfy  such obligation, without prior notice to or
consent from the  Indemnifying Party;   (ii) the Purchaser Indemnified
Party may subsequently make a claim  for indemnification in accordance with
the provisions of this  Agreement; and   6    (iii) the Purchaser
Indemnified Party will be reimbursed, in  accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, for any such  Losses for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to  this Agreement, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party  to dispute the Purchaser Indemnified Party\'s entitlement
to  indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled to 
indemnification, under the provisions of this Agreement.   This Section
2.4(d) is not applicable to payments which aggregate  more than $250,000.  
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 16(d), the Company 
Securityholders consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any  court in
which a Proceeding is brought by any third party against  any Purchaser
Indemnified Party for purposes of any indemnification  claim that a Purchaser
Indemnified Party may have arising under the  Arrangement Agreement with
respect to such Proceeding or the matters  alleged therein.  2.5 Limitation
of Indemnification Period  The obligations of indemnification set forth in
this Section 2 shall be subject to the following limitations as to time:  
(a) General - Subject to Sections 2.5(b) and 2.5(c), the obligations of  the
Indemnifying Parties under this Section 2 shall terminate on the  date which
is the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing  Date (the "GENERAL
INDEMNIFICATION DEADLINE"), except with respect  to any claim for
indemnification hereunder for which a Claim Notice  or Escrow Claim Notice,
as the case may be, has been delivered to  the Indemnifying Parties prior to
the General Indemnification  Deadline.   (b) Tax Claims - The
indemnification obligations of the Company  Securityholders in respect of any
claim for indemnification  hereunder relating to the representations and
warranties of the  Company set out in Section 3.15 (Tax Matters) of the
Arrangement  Agreement, arising in or with respect to a particular period
ending  on or before the Closing Date, shall terminate on the date that is 
ninety (90) days after the relevant Governmental Authority shall no  longer
be entitled to assess or reassess liability for Taxes against  any Acquired
Company for that particular period (having regard to  any waivers given by
the Acquired Company in respect of any taxation  year) (the "TAX
INDEMNIFICATION DEADLINE"), except with respect to  any claim for
indemnification hereunder for which a Claim Notice or  Escrow Claim Notice,
as the case may be, has been delivered to the  Indemnifying Parties prior to
the Tax Indemnification Deadline.   (c) Other Exceptions - The
indemnification obligations of the Company  Securityholders in respect of any
claim for indemnification  hereunder relating to the representations and
warranties of the  Company set out in Sections 3.2(c) (Authority and
Enforceability)  and 3.4 (Capitalization and Ownership) of the Arrangement
Agreement  shall terminate on the date which is the three (3) year
anniversary  of the Closing Date.  2.6 Limitations on Liability   (a)
Except for claims for indemnification described under Section  2.6(c), an
Indemnified Party will not be entitled to any claim for  indemnification
under this Agreement unless and until the aggregate  amount of all Losses
claimed under this Agreement is equal to or  greater than   7   
$750,000; it being understood, however, that after the aggregate  Losses so
claimed exceed $750,000, a claim for indemnification can  be made for the
entire amount of such Losses.   (b) Except as provided in Sections 2.6(c)
and 2.7 below:   (i) at no time shall the aggregate liability of a Company 
Securityholder in connection with or arising out of any and  all matters for
which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are  entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to this Section 2, or  otherwise in connection with this Agreement,
the Arrangement  Agreement or the transactions or other agreements
contemplated  in the Arrangement Agreement, exceed such Company 
Securityholder\'s pro rata portion of the amount then remaining  in the
Escrow Fund in accordance with the percentage  allocations as set forth in
Schedule "H"; and   (ii) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties\' sole and
exclusive recourse  for purposes of satisfying any indemnification
obligations of  the Company Securityholders under this Agreement, the 
Arrangement Agreement or the transactions or other agreements  contemplated
in the Arrangement Agreement shall be to the  Escrow Fund.   (c) With
respect to any claim for indemnification hereunder relating to  the
representations and warranties of the Company set out in  Sections 3.2(c)
(Authority and Enforceability), 3.4 (Capitalization  and Ownership) or 3.15
(Tax Matters) of the Arrangement Agreement,  or that is based on the fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or  wilful misconduct of the Company or any of
its officers, directors  or employees, the indemnification obligations of the
Company  Securityholders hereunder shall be on a several, and not joint and 
several, basis, and the maximum liability of an individual Company 
Securityholder shall not exceed the Company Securityholder\'s pro  rata
portion of the Purchase Price received by such Company  Securityholder
(including, for greater certainty, amounts deemed  paid by that Company
Securityholder pursuant to this Section 2 from  any portion of the Escrow
Fund).   (d) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, an
Indemnified  Party will not be entitled to any claim for indemnification
under  this Agreement for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or 
aggravated damages, including damages for loss of profit.  2.7 Exclusive
Remedies   (a) The parties agree that from and after the Effective Time the
rights  of indemnity set forth in Sections 2 and 9 are the sole and 
exclusive remedy of the parties to this Agreement in respect any  claims for
indemnification or any other Liabilities arising out of  this Agreement, the
Arrangement Agreement or the transactions or  other agreements contemplated
in the Arrangement Agreement, and that  this Section 2 sets out the sole and
exclusive manner by which such  parties, or any of them, may seek monetary
compensation for any  matter in respect of which such parties may make a
claim for  indemnification. For greater certainty, except as provided in
this  Section 2, no Company Securityholder shall have any liability to the 
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or any of them, for or in respect of  any
claims for indemnification or any other Liabilities arising out  of this
Agreement, the Arrangement Agreement or the transactions or  other agreements
contemplated in the Arrangement Agreement.   8    (b) If the outstanding
claims for indemnification of the Purchaser  Indemnified Parties under
Sections 2.3 and 9 exceed, in the  aggregate, the amount then remaining in
the Escrow Fund as of the  date on which the Purchaser is required to deliver
the Final  Consideration, or cause the Final Consideration to be delivered,
to  the Depositary in accordance with Section 3.2 of the Plan of 
Arrangement, the Purchaser may, upon written notice to the  Representative,
withhold and set off against the amount of the  Remaining Set Off Amount
equal to the amount by which such  outstanding claims in the aggregate exceed
the amount then remaining  in the Escrow Fund (the "SET OFF HOLDBACK"). For
so long as any  funds remain in the Escrow Fund, the indemnification
obligations of  the Company Securityholders shall first be discharged by the
release  of funds from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 9. 
Thereafter, the indemnification obligations of the Company  Securityholders
will be discharged out of the Set Off Holdback.  After all outstanding claims
of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties  have been resolved in accordance with
Sections 2.3(g) or 9(e), as  the case maybe, the remaining portion of the Set
Off Holdback will  be distributed to the Company Securityholders in the
manner set  forth in Section 3.2 of the Plan of Arrangement.   (c) For
purposes of the foregoing, "REMAINING SET OFF AMOUNT" shall mean  the
aggregate amount, if any, that remains payable by the Purchaser  under
Section 3.2 (Final Consideration) of the Plan of Arrangement  after the
Company Securityholders receive or are entitled to receive  thereunder equals
$5,000,000 in the aggregate. For greater  certainty, the Purchaser shall not
be entitled to set off any Losses  under Section 2.7(b) unless the Company
Securityholders are entitled  under Section 3.2 (Final Consideration) of the
Plan of Arrangement  to receive an aggregate amount of at least
$5,000,000.  2.8 Insurance  To the extent that any Loss in respect of
which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to an indemnity payment under
this Agreement is covered by insurance proceeds from any insurance policy
owned and paid for by the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date (a
"COMPANY POLICY"), the amount of such payment shall be net of the Net
Proceeds paid to any of the Acquired Companies with respect to such Loss. For
purposes of this Section 2.8, "NET PROCEEDS" shall mean the proceeds actually
received by the applicable Acquired Companies, less any expenses (including
Taxes) of recovery, deductibles and/or co-payments. If the amount of any Loss
in respect of which a Purchaser Indemnified Party has previously received an
indemnity payment is subsequently covered, in whole or in part, by insurance
proceeds from a Company Policy, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall
reimburse the Indemnifying Parties in an amount equal to the Net Proceeds of
such recovery.  3. APPOINTMENT OF ESCROW AGENT   (a) The Purchaser and the
Representative hereby appoint the Escrow  Agent, and the Escrow Agent hereby
accepts such appointment and  agrees to act, as escrow agent in accordance
with the terms and  conditions of this Agreement.   (b) The Purchaser shall
notify the Escrow Agent of the Closing Date and  the Effective Time as soon
as reasonably practical and, in any  event, no later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing  Date.   9    (c) In the event that the Plan
of Arrangement is amended subsequent to  the date hereof, the Purchaser shall
promptly deliver a copy of the  Plan of Arrangement, as amended, to the
Escrow Agent.  4. ESTABLISHMENT OF ESCROW FUND AND REPRESENTATIVE HOLDBACK
FUND   (a) Pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, at or prior to the
Effective  Time, the Purchaser will deliver or cause to be delivered by
wire  transfer to the Depositary payment in the amount of: (i) the Initial 
Consideration; and (ii) the Aggregate Preference Amount. From the  Initial
Consideration, the Depositary shall forthwith deliver to the  Escrow
Agent:   (i) the Pro Rata Escrow Amount, to be held in escrow as part of 
the Aggregate Escrow Amount and released in accordance with  this
Agreement;   (ii) the Preference Share Escrow Amount, to be held in escrow
as  part of the Aggregate Escrow Amount and released in accordance  with
this Agreement; and   (iii) $100,000 (the "REPRESENTATIVE EXPENSE AMOUNT"),
to be held in  escrow and released in accordance with this Agreement.  
Upon receipt of the Aggregate Escrow Amount, the Escrow Agent shall  deliver
a written notice to the Purchaser and the Representative  acknowledging
receipt of the Aggregate Escrow Amount.   (b) The Escrow Agent will record
the Aggregate Escrow Amount in a  separate trust account comprising, at any
time, the Aggregate Escrow  Amount at such time, and any income earned
thereon, less any  payments or deductions therefrom (the "ESCROW FUND").  
(c) The Escrow Agent will record the Representative Expense Amount in a 
separate trust account comprising, at any time, the Representative  Expense
Amount at such time, and any income earned thereon, less any  payments or
deductions therefrom (the "REPRESENTATIVE EXPENSE  FUND").   (d) The Escrow
Agent hereby agrees to hold, safeguard, invest and  release the Escrow Fund
as provided in this Agreement. The Escrow  Agent is hereby authorized to
release funds out of monies  constituting the Escrow Fund only in accordance
with the express  terms of this Agreement.  5. INVESTMENT OF AGGREGATE
ESCROW AMOUNT AND REPRESENTATIVE EXPENSE AMOUNT   (a) Until the release of
all or any part of the Escrow Fund or  Representative Expense Fund, as the
case may be, in accordance with  the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow Fund
or any remaining  portion thereof and the Representative Expense Fund or any
remaining  portion thereof shall be kept segregated and shall be deposited
in  an interest bearing cash account to be held by the Escrow Agent at a 
bank listed in Schedule I of the Bank Act (Canada).   (b) All earnings
received from the investment of the Aggregate Escrow  Amount (or part
thereof) shall be credited to, and shall become a  part of, the Escrow Fund
and all earnings received   10    from the investment of the
Representative Expense Amount (or part  thereof) shall be credited to, and
shall become part of, the  Representative Expense Fund. Neither the Escrow
Agent, the  Representative, the Parent nor the Purchaser shall have any 
responsibility or liability for any diminution of the Escrow Fund or 
Representative Expense Fund that may result from any investment made 
pursuant to this Section 5, including any losses on any investment  required
to be liquidated prior to maturity in order to make a  payment required
hereunder.  6. RELEASE TERMS   (a) Subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9, the  relevant amount of the Escrow Fund may be
released to a Purchaser  Indemnified Party from time to time in respect of
any Escrow Claim  Satisfaction Amount (as defined in Section 9(a)(ii)) for
any claim  for indemnification against the Escrow Fund (an "ESCROW CLAIM")
made  prior to the Second Release Time (as defined in Section 6(c) below) 
by a Purchaser Indemnified Party against any of the Company  Securityholders
pursuant to this Agreement.   (b) At 10:00 a.m. (PST) on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date  (the "FIRST RELEASE TIME"), to the extent
that the aggregate of any  Escrow Claims made prior to the First Release Time
has not resulted  in fifty percent (50%) or more of the initial Aggregate
Escrow  Amount having previously been released to the Purchaser Indemnified 
Parties, or any of them, the balance of such amount up to fifty  percent
(50%) of the initial Aggregate Escrow Amount then remaining  in escrow and
any interest or other income or gains accrued or  earned thereon (the "FIRST
ESCROW RELEASE AMOUNT") shall be released  and delivered to the Depositary in
accordance with a written  direction from the Representative to the Escrow
Agent substantially  in the form of Schedule "E"; provided, however, that if
one or more  Escrow Claims have been made by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties,  or any of them, before the First Release Time but have not been 
resolved, or have been resolved but not yet satisfied in accordance  with the
provisions hereof as of the First Release Time, and which  involves an
aggregate Escrow Claim Amount (as defined in Section  9(a)(i)) which is
greater than the First Escrow Release Amount, no  amount shall be released
hereunder by the Escrow Agent until such  Escrow Claims have been resolved or
satisfied in accordance with the  provisions of this Agreement. If the
aggregate Escrow Claim Amount  arising from such Escrow Claims is less than
the First Escrow  Release Amount, the amount by which the First Escrow
Release Amount  exceeds the aggregate Escrow Claim Amount of such Escrow
Claims and  any interest or other income or gains accrued or earned on such 
excess amount shall be released and delivered by the Escrow Agent to  the
Depositary in accordance with a written direction from the  Representative to
the Escrow Agent substantially in the form of  Schedule "E".   (c) At 10:00
a.m. (PST) on the date eighteen (18) months following the  Closing Date (the
"SECOND RELEASE TIME"), to the extent that the  aggregate of any Escrow
Claims made prior to the Second Release Time  has not resulted in the entire
remaining amount in the Escrow Fund  having previously been released to the
Purchaser Indemnified  Parties, or any of them, the balance of the amount in
the Escrow  Fund then remaining and any interest or other income or gains 
accrued or earned thereon, shall be released and delivered to the  Depositary
in accordance with a written direction from the  Representative to the Escrow
Agent substantially in the form of  Schedule "E"; provided, however, that, if
one or more Escrow Claims  have been made by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, or any of them,  before the Second Release Time but have not been
resolved, or have  been resolved but not yet satisfied in accordance with
the  provisions hereof as of the Second Release Time, and which involves  
11    an aggregate Escrow Claim Amount which is greater than the balance 
of the Escrow Fund then remaining, no amount of the remaining Escrow  Fund
shall be released hereunder by the Escrow Agent until such  Escrow Claims
have been resolved or satisfied in accordance with the  provisions of this
Agreement. If the aggregate Escrow Claim Amount  arising from such Escrow
Claims is less than the balance of the  Escrow Fund then remaining, the
amount by which the balance of the  Escrow Fund exceeds the aggregate Escrow
Claim Amount of such Escrow  Claims shall be released and delivered by the
Escrow Agent to the  Depositary for distribution to the Company
Securityholders in  accordance with the written direction of the
Representative pursuant  to Section 11.5. Where, in accordance with the
foregoing, the  balance of the Escrow Fund has not been released as a result
of an  Escrow Claim not having been fully resolved or satisfied, forthwith 
upon the resolution or satisfaction of such Escrow Claim in whole or  in
part, that portion of the balance of the Escrow Fund which is no  longer
subject to an unresolved or unsatisfied Escrow Claim and any  interest or
other income or gains accrued or earned thereon shall be  released and
delivered by the Escrow Agent to the Depositary, for  distribution to the
Company Securityholders in accordance with a  written direction from the
Representative to the Escrow Agent  substantially in the form of Schedule
"E".   (d) Each time that the Escrow Agent releases any portion of the
Escrow  Fund to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or any of them, the 
Escrow Agent shall notify the Representative in accordance with  Section
16(a).   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the  Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to deliver any or all of the 
Escrow Fund as directed from time to time in joint written  instructions
signed by or on behalf of the Purchaser and the  Representative.   (f) The
Escrow Agent\'s trust account containing the Escrow Fund shall be  in
existence on the date the Escrow Agent receives the Aggregate  Escrow Amount
and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. (PST) on the date the  entire Escrow Fund
has been distributed to the Purchaser, the  Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or
any of them, and/or the Depositary  for distribution to the Company
Securityholders, as the case may be,  in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.   (g) Upon receipt of an invoice from the Representative in
respect of  expenses incurred in her capacity as Representative under this 
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall within thirty (30) Business Days  deliver
by cheque from the Representative Expense Fund to an address  specified by
the Representative an amount equal to the amount set  forth in such
invoice.   (h) At such time as the Representative has no further
responsibilities  under this Agreement, the Representative shall deliver a
written  instruction substantially in the form of Schedule "E" instructing 
the Escrow Agent to deliver all amounts remaining in the  Representative
Expense Fund to the Depositary.   (i) The Escrow Agent\'s trust account
containing the Representative  Expense Fund shall be in existence on the date
the Escrow Agent  receives the Representative Expense Amount and shall
terminate on  the date the entire Representative Expense Fund has been
distributed  to the Representative or the Representative instructs the
Escrow  Agent to release the amount remaining in the Representative Expense 
Fund to the Depositary in accordance with Section 6(h) above.   12   7.
OPTIONEE AND EXERCISING SHAREHOLDER ESCROW   (a) Pursuant to the Plan of
Arrangement, at the Effective Time, the  Purchaser will deliver or cause to
be delivered by wire transfer to  the Depositary payment in an amount equal
to the Initial  Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Representative  will deliver a written direction in the form of Schedule
"A"  directing the Depositary to deliver to the Escrow Agent from such 
amount :   (i) in respect of each holder of Company Options identified as
a  "HOLDBACK OPTIONEE" on Schedule "C" hereto (as updated by the  Company in
accordance with Section 5.4(f) of the Arrangement  Agreement), an amount (the
"OPTION HOLDBACK AMOUNT") equal to  25% of the Initial Per Share
Consideration in respect of each  Company Option held by such Holdback
Optionee immediately  prior to the Effective Time, and the aggregate of all
such  Option Holdback Amounts (the "TOTAL OPTION HOLDBACK AMOUNT")  shall be
held and released by the Escrow Agent in accordance  with this Agreement;
and   (ii) in respect of each Exercising Shareholder (as defined below), 
an amount (the "EXERCISING SHAREHOLDER HOLDBACK AMOUNT") equal  to 25% of the
Initial Per Share Consideration in respect of  each Option Share (as defined
below) held by such Exercising  Shareholder immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and the  aggregate of all such Exercising Shareholder
Holdback Amounts  (the "TOTAL EXERCISING SHAREHOLDER HOLDBACK AMOUNT") shall
be  held and released by the Escrow Agent in accordance with this 
Agreement.   The term "EXERCISING SHAREHOLDER" means a Company
Shareholder,  identified as such on Schedule "C" hereto (as updated by the
Company  in accordance with Section 5.4(f) of the Arrangement Agreement),
who  holds Option Shares. The term "OPTION SHARES" means Common Shares 
issued by the Company after June 30, 2006 as a result of the  exercise of
Company Options by the holder thereof.   (b) Upon receipt of the Total
Option Holdback Amount and Total  Exercising Shareholder Holdback Amount
(together, the "AGGREGATE  HOLDBACK AMOUNT"), the Escrow Agent shall deliver
a written notice  to the Purchaser and the Representative acknowledging
receipt of  such amounts.   (c) The Escrow Agent shall hold the Aggregate
Holdback Amount and any  interest or other income or gains accrued or earned
thereon (the  "ACCRUED INTEREST") in escrow until released by the Escrow
Agent to  the Depositary in accordance with Section 7(h).   (d) The Escrow
Agent hereby agrees to hold, safeguard, invest and  release the Aggregate
Holdback Amount and all Accrued Interest  thereon as provided in this
Agreement. The Escrow Agent is hereby  authorized to release funds out of
monies constituting the Aggregate  Holdback Amount and Accrued Interest
thereon only in accordance with  the express terms of this Agreement.   (e)
Until the release of the Aggregate Holdback Amount and all Accrued  Interest
on such amount in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement, the Aggregate
Holdback Amount and all Accrued Interest on  such amount shall be kept
segregated and shall be deposited in an  interest bearing cash account to be
held by the Escrow Agent at a  bank listed in Schedule I of   13    the
Bank Act (Canada). All Accrued Interest received from the  investment of the
Aggregate Holdback Amount shall be credited to,  and shall become a part of,
the Aggregate Holdback Amount. The  Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility
or liability for any  diminution of the Aggregate Holdback Amount that may
result from any  investment made pursuant to this Section 7.   (f) Within
five (5) Business Days after the First Release Time, the  Purchaser shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent and the Depositary, with  a copy to the
Representative, a list certified by an officer of the  Purchaser (the
"HOLDBACK RELEASE LIST") setting forth those Holdback  Optionees and
Exercising Shareholders: (i) who have remained  employed by the Purchaser,
the Parent or any of the Acquired  Companies (or any of their successors)
from the Effective Date  through to the First Release Time; (ii) who have
suffered a  Permanent Disability or died prior to the First Release Time;
or  (iii) who have ceased to be employed by the Purchaser, the Parent or 
any of the Acquired Companies prior to the First Release Time for  any reason
other than Permanent Disability, death, voluntary  resignation by such
Holdback Optionee or Exercising Shareholder, as  the case may be, or the
termination of such Holdback Optionee\'s or  Exercising Shareholder\'s
employment for cause (the "REMAINING  EMPLOYEES") and Company Securityholders
other than Company  Securityholders who were Holdback Optionees or
Exercising  Shareholders as of the date of this Agreement but who are not 
Remaining Employees as of the First Release Time (the "REMAINING 
SECURITYHOLDERS"). For purposes of this Section 7(f), "PERMANENT  Disability"
means an employee\'s absence from his or her duties for  more than three (3)
consecutive months as a result of such  employee\'s incapacity due to
physical or mental illness.   (g) The Holdback Release List shall specify
(as applicable): (i) the  portion of the Total Option Holdback Amount,
together with the  Accrued Interest thereon, less applicable withholding
taxes, to be  distributed to each Remaining Employee; (ii) the portion of
the  Total Exercising Shareholder Holdback Amount, together with the 
Accrued Interest thereon, less applicable withholding taxes, to be 
distributed to each Remaining Employee; (iii) the portion of the  remainder
of the Aggregate Holdback Amount, together with the  Accrued Interest thereon
(collectively, the "REMAINING HOLDBACK  AMOUNT"), less applicable withholding
taxes, to be distributed to  each Remaining Securityholder (as defined
below); and (iv) the  amount of withholding taxes payable in respect of the
portion of the  Total Option Holdback Amount, the Total Exercising
Shareholder  Holdback Amount and the Remaining Holdback Amount. The
Remaining  Holdback Amount shall be allocated among all Remaining 
Securityholders. For purposes of determining the amount that a  particular
Remaining Securityholder is entitled to receive pursuant  to the foregoing,
"pro rata" shall be determined by reference by the  total number of Shares
and Company Options held by the particular  Remaining Securityholder at the
last moment in time prior to the  Effective Time as compared to the total
number of Shares and Company  Options held by all Remaining Securityholders
entitled to receive a  portion of the Remaining Holdback Amount.   (h)
Within three (3) Business Days after receipt of the Holdback Release  List,
the Escrow Agent shall release the Aggregate Holdback Amount  and any Accrued
Interest thereon to the Depositary, together with a  written instruction from
the Escrow Agent specifying the amount of  Accrued Interest payable: (i) to
each Remaining Employee in respect  of his or her portion of the Total Option
Holdback Amount and/or  Total Exercising Shareholder Holdback Amount; and
(ii) to each  Remaining Securityholder in respect of his or her portion of
the  Remaining Holdback Amount.   14   8. ESCROW AGENT  The acceptance
by the Escrow Agent of its duties and obligations under this Agreement is
subject to the following terms and conditions, which the parties to this
Agreement hereby agree shall govern and control with respect to the
Escrow Agent\'s rights, duties, liabilities and immunities:   (a) Except
for acts of gross negligence or wilful misconduct, the Escrow  Agent shall
not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be  taken by it or on its
behalf in good faith and in the exercise of  its reasonable judgment and any
act done or omitted by it. The  Escrow Agent may at any time consult with
independent legal counsel  of its own choice in any such matters, shall have
full and complete  authorization and protection from any action taken or
omitted by it  hereunder in accordance with the advice of such legal counsel
on its  part and shall incur no liability for any delay reasonably required 
to obtain the advice of any such legal counsel. The Escrow Agent  shall not
be answerable for the default or misconduct of any agent  or legal counsel
employed or appointed, at its discretion, by it if  such agent or legal
counsel shall have been selected with reasonable  care;   (b) The Company,
the Company Securityholders (including the  Representative), the Purchaser
and the Parent shall indemnify and  hold harmless the Escrow Agent and its
employees, directors and  officers from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, costs,  claims, actions or demands whatsoever which may be brought
against  the Escrow Agent or which it may suffer or incur as a result of or 
arising out of the performance of its duties and obligations under  this
Agreement, save only in the event of the gross negligence or  the wilful
misconduct of the Escrow Agent. It is understood and  agreed that this
indemnification shall survive the termination or  discharge of this Agreement
or the resignation of the Escrow Agent;   (c) The Escrow Agent and its
partners, employees, agents, successors and  assigns shall not be liable for
any damage, loss or destruction of  any of the documents held hereunder due
to fire, flood, tornado, act  of God, theft, or any other similar causes not
resulting from the  gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Escrow Agent
or its  employees, agents, successors and assigns;   (d) The Escrow Agent
and its employees, agents, successors and assigns  shall have no duty to know
or determine the performance or  non-performance of any provision of this
Agreement or any other  agreement except as expressly required or
contemplated in the  performance by the Escrow Agent of the functions
contemplated to be  performed by it under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent
may act in  reliance upon any instrument or signature believed by it to be 
genuine and may assume that the person purporting to give receipt or  advice
or make any statement or execute any document in connection  with the
provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so. The  duties and
responsibilities of the Escrow Agent are purely  administrative in nature and
are limited to those expressly stated  herein;   (e) The provisions of this
Agreement are not intended to and shall not  restrict or remove any other
rights which the Escrow Agent may have  at law or in equity to seek relief or
direction from any court of  competent jurisdiction in addition to such as
are expressly set  forth herein;   (f) Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, the Escrow Agent is  hereby authorized to disregard any and
all notices or warnings,  other than written notices given by or on behalf of
both the  Purchaser and the Representative or their respective counsel, and
is  hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey any and all 
processes, orders, judgments or   15    decrees of any court having
jurisdiction as permitted by Section  16(d). If the Escrow Agent obeys or
complies with any such process,  order, judgment, or decree of such a court
from which all rights of  appeal have expired, the Escrow Agent and its
partners, employees,  agents, successors and assigns shall not be liable to
any of the  other parties hereto or anyone else by reason of such
compliance,  notwithstanding any such process, order, judgment, or decree
be  subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, or vacated, or  be
subsequently found to have been issued or entered into without 
jurisdiction;   (g) The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty or obligation to
ascertain  the identity, authority, or rights of the parties (or their
agents)  executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this 
Agreement, or any instruments, documents, or paper related hereto or 
properties deposited or called for hereunder;   (h) The Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to be paid its usual fees for the  performance of its duties
hereunder and to be reimbursed for any  disbursements incurred in connection
with the performance of its  duties hereunder (collectively, the "ESCROW
AGENT FEES"). The  Purchaser and the Parent shall be jointly and severally
liable for  all Escrow Agent Fees and the Purchaser shall be invoiced for 
payment of the Escrow Agent Fees, on its own behalf and on behalf of  the
Parent, and failing the receipt of payment from the Purchaser  the Escrow
Agent may request payment from the Parent;   (i) The Escrow Agent may resign
from its position at any time upon  thirty (30) days prior written notice to
the Purchaser and the  Representative. In addition, the Purchaser and the
Representative  may jointly remove the Escrow Agent at any time without
cause, by an  instrument given to the Escrow Agent, which instrument shall 
designate the effective date of such removal. Upon such resignation  or
removal, the Escrow Agent shall take such steps as are necessary  to transfer
any property held in escrow to a successor escrow agent  agreed to by the
Purchaser and the Representative, and, where such  agreement is not obtained
within seven (7) Business Days after the  Escrow Agent\'s resignation or
removal, then to any court of  competent jurisdiction. Upon such resignation
or removal, the Escrow  Agent shall be discharged of and from any and all
further  obligations arising in connection with this Agreement other than
to  retain and safeguard the Escrow Fund and the Representative Expense 
Fund then in its possession until receipt of a designation of  successor
escrow agent or a joint written disposition instruction by  or on behalf of
the Purchaser and the Representative or a final  non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction;   (j) Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall require the Escrow Agent  to expend its own funds or otherwise incur
financial liability in  the performance of any of its duties or in the
exercise of any of  its rights or powers, or do anything not expressly
provided for  herein, except in relation to acts of gross negligence or
wilful  misconduct of the Escrow Agent or its employees, agents, successors 
and assigns; and   (k) In the event of any disagreement between or among any
or all of the  Purchaser, the Company Securityholders or the Representative 
resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with  the
Escrow Fund or in the event that the Escrow Agent is in doubt as  to what
action it should take hereunder, the Escrow Agent, in its  discretion, shall
be entitled to retain the Escrow Fund until the  Escrow Agent shall have
received (i) joint written instructions of  or on behalf of the Purchaser and
the Representative directing  delivery of the Escrow Fund, or (ii) a written
decision of any court  of competent jurisdiction from which all rights of
appeal have  expired directing delivery of the Escrow Fund, in which event
the  Escrow Agent   16    shall disburse the Escrow Fund in accordance
with such instructions  or decision. The Escrow Agent shall act on such
instructions or  decision without further question.  9. CLAIMS   (a) For
purposes of this Agreement:   (i) "ESCROW CLAIM AMOUNT" shall mean the
amount specified by the  Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or any of them, in an
Escrow  Claim Notice (estimated on information then available) for  which
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or any of them, is  making an Escrow Claim
pursuant to and in accordance with  Section 6(a) of this Agreement; and  
(ii) "ESCROW CLAIM SATISFACTION AMOUNT" shall mean the final amount 
determined for satisfaction of any Escrow Claim by the  applicable Purchaser
Indemnified Parties in accordance with  the provisions of this Agreement.  
(b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, at any time or times before  the
Second Release Time, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or any  of them, may
make Escrow Claims against the Escrow Fund for amounts  due for
indemnification pursuant to and in accordance with this  Agreement by
notifying the Representative and the Escrow Agent in  writing of the Escrow
Claim, including a brief description (based on  information then available)
of the nature of the Escrow Claim and  the estimated amount of the Escrow
Claim (in each case, an "ESCROW  CLAIM NOTICE").   (c) To dispute any
Escrow Claim, the Representative shall give written  notice of such dispute
(in each case, an "ESCROW DISPUTE NOTICE") to  the applicable Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and the Escrow Agent  within forty-five (45) days after
receipt of an Escrow Claim Notice.  The Escrow Dispute Notice shall include a
summary describing in  reasonable detail the good faith basis on which the
Escrow Claim is  being disputed by the Representative. If the Escrow Agent
does not  receive an Escrow Dispute Notice from or on behalf of the 
Representative within forty-five (45) days after receipt by the  Escrow Agent
of the Escrow Claim Notice, the Escrow Claim and Escrow  Claim Amount shall
be deemed be acknowledged and agreed upon by the  Representative, the Escrow
Claim Satisfaction Amount shall be deemed  to be equal to the Escrow Claim
Amount specified in the Escrow Claim  Notice and the deemed Escrow Claim
Satisfaction Amount shall be  deliverable to the applicable Purchaser
Indemnified Parties.   (d) If the Representative delivers an Escrow Dispute
Notice in  accordance with Section 9(c), then the dispute may be resolved
by  any legally available means consistent with the provisions of  Section
16(d).   (e) If the Representative delivers an Escrow Dispute Notice in 
accordance with Section 9(c), except as provided below the Escrow  Agent
shall not release or deliver to the Representative any of the  Escrow Fund at
the First Release Time, if such date has not passed,  or the Second Release
Time, if such date has not passed, and shall  not release or deliver to a
Purchaser Indemnified Party any of the  Escrow Fund in connection with such
disputed Escrow Claim unless and  until either:   17    (i) a direction
to release and deliver the Escrow Fund in  connection with such Escrow Claim
has been executed jointly by  the Purchaser and the Representative; or  
(ii) a written decision of any court of competent jurisdiction has  been
rendered in relation to the disputed Escrow Claim (which  decision may
include an order for costs) from which all rights  of appeal have
expired.   Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if at
any  time, there shall exist an outstanding dispute concerning an Escrow 
Claim in respect of which an Escrow Dispute Notice has been properly 
delivered by the Representative in accordance with Section 9(c), the  Escrow
Agent shall still distribute from the Escrow Fund: (i) to the  Purchaser,
that portion of such Escrow Claim which has not been  disputed by the
Representative within five (5) Business Days of the  Escrow Agent receiving
the applicable Escrow Dispute Notice and/or  (ii) to the Depositary, on the
date of the First Release Time or  Second Release Time, as the case may be,
any portion of the Escrow  Fund which is not subject to an Escrow Claim and
is otherwise  required to be distributed to the Depositary on such date.  
(f) Upon resolution of any Escrow Claim that permits recovery against  the
Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 9(e) above, the Purchaser  shall give
written notice of such resolution (the "RELEASE NOTICE")  to the Escrow
Agent, with a copy to the Representative. Such Release  Notice shall specify
the Escrow Claim Satisfaction Amount and shall  be accompanied: (i) in the
case of an Escrow Claim where the  Representative is deemed to have agreed to
an Escrow Claim because  the Representative has not objected to such Escrow
Claim by giving  an Escrow Dispute Notice in the manner and within the time
set forth  in Section 9(c) above, by an officer\'s certificate from the 
Purchaser certifying that notice of such Escrow Claim was given in 
accordance with Section 9(b) above and that the time period in  Section 9(c)
above has expired and that the Representative did not  dispute such Escrow
Claim within such time period; (ii) in the case  of an Escrow Claim settled
by written agreement between the  Purchaser and the Representative, by a copy
of the written direction  under Section 9(e)(i) specifying the amount of such
recovery; and  (iii) in the case of an Escrow Claim resolved by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, by a copy of the written decision of such  court,
from which all rights of appeal have expired (as certified in  writing by an
officer of the Purchaser), specifying the amount of  such recovery. With
respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) in this  Section 9(f), if the Purchaser
fails to provide the Release Notice  to the Escrow Agent within fifteen (15)
days after resolution of  such Escrow Claim, the Representative may do so.
The Escrow Agent  shall pay the applicable Escrow Claim Satisfaction Amount
within  five (5) Business Days after it receives the relevant Release 
Notice. In no event shall the Escrow Agent pay any amounts to a  Purchaser
Indemnified Party in respect of an Escrow Claim if it has  not received a
Release Notice and the other written instruments  required to accompany such
Release Notice.   (g) If any Escrow Claims timely delivered in accordance
with this  Agreement have not been resolved as of the Second Release Time,
the  portion of the Escrow Fund having an aggregate value equal to the 
amount subject to such unresolved Escrow Claims shall be retained in  escrow
by the Escrow Agent until such Escrow Claims have been  resolved in the
manner provided in this Agreement, whereupon any  remaining amount of the
Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the  Depositary, to be disbursed to the
Company Securityholders at the  direction of the Representative in accordance
with this Agreement.   18   10. REPRESENTATIVE   (a) Each Company
Securityholder designates and appoints the  Representative (including any
replacement or successor appointed in  accordance with Section 10(i)) as such
Company Securityholder\'s  agent and attorney-in-fact with full power and
authority to act for  and on behalf of each Company Securityholder:   (i)
to give and receive notices and communications on behalf of  the Company
Securityholders that may be given pursuant to this  Agreement and the
Arrangement Agreement, including to accept  service of process on behalf of
the Company Securityholders;   (ii) to authorize and agree to the Final
Consideration under the  Plan of Arrangement;   (iii) to dispute, agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and  compromises of, and comply with
Judgments of courts or other  Governmental Authorities, with respect to, any
claims by any  Purchaser Indemnified Party against the Company
Securityholder  or by the Company Securityholder against any Purchaser 
Indemnified Party, or any other dispute between any Purchaser  Indemnified
Party and the Company Securityholder;   (iv) to authorize delivery to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or  any of them, of cash from the Escrow Fund
in satisfaction of  indemnification claims pursuant to this Agreement;  
(v) to institute any and all proceedings on behalf of the Company 
Securityholder in any relevant jurisdiction in respect of any  dispute with
the Purchaser, the Parent or any other Person  arising out of or in
connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or the
Arrangement Agreement;   (vi) to provide any waiver hereunder on behalf of
the Company  Securityholders or any of them or to agree to any amendment of 
this Agreement, the Plan of Agreement or the Arrangement  Agreement on behalf
of the Company Securityholders; and   (vii) to take all actions that are
either (A) necessary or desirable  in the sole judgment of the Representative
for the  accomplishment of the foregoing or (B) specifically mandated  by
the terms of this Agreement, the Plan of Agreement or the  Arrangement
Agreement.   (b) The Escrow Agent and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall deal  solely with the Representative, on behalf of the Company 
Securityholders, in connection with all matters pertaining to or  arising out
of this Agreement, the Plan of Arrangement and the  Arrangement Agreement.
The Representative shall keep the Company  Securityholders informed of all
matters that are determined by the  Representative in her sole discretion to
be material relating to  this Agreement, the Plan of Arrangement and the
Arrangement  Agreement and all written notices or other communications in 
connection therewith determined by the Representative in her sole  discretion
to be material ("MATERIAL SECURITYHOLDER MATTERS") shall  be sent to the
Company Shareholders by the Representative in  accordance with Section 10(j).
For greater certainty, the receipt by  the Representative of an Escrow Claim
Notice in respect of an Escrow  Claim amount in excess of $50,000 shall be
deemed to be a Material   19     Shareholder Matter, and any such Escrow
Claim Notice must therefore  be provided to the Company Securityholders by
the Representative.  Notices or communications to or from the Representative
constitute  notice to or from each of the Company Securityholders for all 
purposes under the Arrangement Agreement and this Agreement.   (c) The
Representative may delegate all or part of her authority as  Representative
to any one or more of the Company Securityholders who  agree to such
delegation for a fixed or indeterminate period of time  upon not less than
ten (10) Business Days\' prior written notice to  the Purchaser and the
Escrow Agent in accordance with this  Agreement. In the event of the death or
incapacity of the  Representative, a successor Representative will be elected
promptly  by Company Securityholders holding not less than 60% of the Fully 
Diluted Shares as of the Closing Date and such Company  Securityholders will
so notify the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent.  Each successor Representative
has all of the power, authority,  rights, privileges and obligations
conferred by the Arrangement  Agreement and this Agreement upon the original
Representative, and  the term "REPRESENTATIVE" as used in the Arrangement
Agreement, the  Plan of Arrangement and this Agreement includes any
successor  Representative.   (d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Representative  constitutes a decision of all the Company Securityholders
and is  final, binding and conclusive upon the Company Securityholders, and 
the Purchaser, the Parent, the Escrow Agent and any Indemnified  Party may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction  of the
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or  instruction of the
Company Securityholders. The Escrow Agent, the  Purchaser and the Parent are
hereby relieved from any Liability to  any Person, except for any act or
omission constituting fraud or  wilful misconduct by the Escrow Agent, the
Purchaser or the Parent,  for any acts done or omissions by the Escrow Agent,
the Purchaser or  the Parent in accordance with such decision, act, consent
or  instruction of the Representative. Without limiting the generality  of
the foregoing, the Escrow Agent and the Purchaser are entitled to  rely,
without inquiry, upon any document delivered by the  Representative as being
genuine and correct and having been duly  signed or sent by the
Representative.   (e) Neither the Representative nor any delegate under
paragraph (c)  above will have any Liability to any Person for any act done
or  omitted by the Representative or delegate, as the case may be, or on 
his or her behalf, under this Agreement, the Plan of Agreement, the 
Arrangement Agreement or other agreements contemplated under the  Arrangement
Agreement, as may be amended, as the Representative  while acting in good
faith and not in a manner constituting gross  negligence or wilful
misconduct, and any act done or omitted  pursuant to the advice of counsel
will be conclusive evidence of  such good faith. The Company Securityholders
will severally, and not  jointly and severally, indemnify the Representative
in proportion to  their interest in the Initial Consideration and hold the 
Representative harmless from and against any Losses she may suffer  as a
result of any such action or omission. In no event will a  Company
Securityholder be obliged to indemnify the Representative in  an amount
exceeding their portion of the Purchase Price actually  received.   (f) The
Representative will receive no compensation for services as the 
Representative and no bond shall be required of the Representative.  The
Company Securityholders will reimburse, on a pro rata basis in  proportion to
their interest in the Initial Consideration, the  Representative for
professional fees and expenses of any attorney,  accountant or other advisors
retained by the Representative and  other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred   20     by the Representative in connection with the
performance of the  Representative\'s duties under the Arrangement Agreement
and this  Agreement.   (g) The appointment and grant of power and authority
by the Company  Securityholders to the Representative pursuant to this
Section 10 is  coupled with an interest, is in consideration of the mutual 
covenants made in this Agreement, is irrevocable and may not be  terminated
by the act of any Company Securityholder or by operation  of law, whether
upon the death or incapacity of any Company  Securityholder, or by the
occurrence of any other event, and the  indemnity provided to the
Representative pursuant to paragraph (e)  above shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.   (h) The Representative shall keep confidential and
shall not disclose  any information disclosed or released to her in her
capacity as  Representative unless, in her reasonable opinion, she is
required to  disclose such information under any applicable Laws, Judgment
or  administrative directions or as is reasonably necessary in order for 
her to effect her duties as the Representative.   (i) The Representative may
resign from her position on giving not less  than thirty (30) days prior
written notice to the Purchaser, the  Escrow Agent and the Depositary. In
addition, the Company  Securityholders may jointly remove the Representative
at any time,  without cause, by delivering a written instrument signed by
Company  Securityholders holding not less than 60% of the Fully Diluted 
Shares as of the Closing Date to the Representative (with a copy to  the
Purchaser), which instrument shall designate the effective date  of such
removal. In the event of the resignation or removal of the  Representative, a
successor Representative will be elected promptly  by Company Securityholders
holding not less than 60% of the Fully  Diluted Shares as of the Closing Date
and such Company  Securityholders will so notify the Purchaser, the Escrow
Agent and  the Depositary. Upon such resignation or removal, the
Representative  shall be discharged of and from any and all further
obligations  arising in connection with this Agreement.   (j) As soon as
reasonably practicable after receipt by the  Representative of an Escrow
Claim Notice in respect of an Escrow  Claim amount in excess of $50,000 or
any other written notices or  other communications in connection with a
Material Shareholder  Matter, the Representative shall forward a notice
(the  "REPRESENTATIVE ESCROW CLAIM NOTICE") to each of the Company 
Securityholders, which notice shall include: (i) a copy of such  Escrow Claim
Notice or other written notices or other communications  in connection with a
Material Shareholder Matter; and (ii) a  statement as to whether or not the
Representative intends to dispute  the Escrow Claim Notice or other written
notices or other  communications in connection with a Material Shareholder
Matter,  where applicable. Upon receipt of any such notices or other 
communications in connection with a Material Shareholder Matter, a  Company
Securityholder may, at such Company Securityholder\'s option,  contact the
Representative to discuss the applicable Shareholder  Material Matter and the
Representative will use commercially  reasonable efforts to discuss the
Shareholder Material Matter and  the Representative\'s proposed response to
such matter, notice or  other communication with the Company Securityholder.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the Representative shall be entitled to
respond to  and otherwise deal with the Escrow Claim Notice in her sole 
discretion, in accordance with her duties and obligations under this 
Agreement.   (k) Neither the Representative, any delegate under paragraph
(c) above,  the Company, the Purchaser nor the Parent will have any
obligation  to notify any Company Securityholder of   21     the
deadline for the delivery of the documents required to be  delivered to the
Depositary under section 5.3 (Extinction of Rights)  of the Plan of
Arrangement. In addition, neither the Representative,  any such delegate, the
Company, the Purchaser nor the Parent will be  obliged to take any action or
provide any notice to any Company  Securityholder in connection with the
Company Securityholders\'  obligation to deliver certificate(s) and/or
agreement(s) to the  Depositary under Article 11 of this Agreement.   (l)
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that the  Representative
shall have no obligations to any Person under the  terms of this Agreement
until the Effective Date.  11. DEPOSITARY  11.1 Appointment of
Depositary.   (a) Computershare Investor Services Inc. is hereby appointed
to act as  the Depositary in connection with the Plan of Arrangement on the

appointment on such terms and conditions. The Depositary shall  have no
duties or obligations other than those set forth herein or  as may
subsequently be agreed to by the Depositary.   (b) The Purchaser shall
notify the Depositary of the Closing Date and  the Effective Time as soon as
reasonably practical and, in any  event, no later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing  Date.   (c) In the event that the Plan of
Arrangement is amended subsequent to  the date hereof, the Purchaser shall
promptly deliver a copy of the  Plan of Arrangement, as amended, to the
Depositary.  11.2 Delivery of Initial Consideration and Aggregate Preference
Amount.   (a) Pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, at or prior to the
Effective  Time, the Purchaser will deliver or cause to be delivered to the 
Depositary by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount  equal
to the aggregate of: (i) the Initial Consideration; and (ii)  the Aggregate
Preference Amount.   (b) The Initial Consideration and the Aggregate
Preference Amount shall  be held in a non-interest bearing account by the
Depositary until  such funds are disbursed in accordance with the terms and
conditions  of this Agreement.  11.3 Disbursement of Initial Consideration
and Aggregate Preference Amount   (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Representative shall deliver  a written instruction to the Depositary and the
Escrow Agent  substantially in the form of Schedule "A" (the "CLOSING DATE
PAYMENT  DIRECTION") and the Purchaser shall deliver a written instruction
to  the Depositary and the Escrow Agent specifying the amount of  applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect of the portion of  the Aggregate
Preference Amount and Initial Consideration payable to  the Company
Securityholders (as applicable) (the "CLOSING DATE TAX  DIRECTION").
Forthwith upon receipt of the Initial Consideration,  the Depositary
shall,   22     in accordance with the Closing Date Payment Direction
and Closing  Date Tax Direction, deliver:   (i) the Pro Rata Escrow Amount
and Preference Share Escrow Amount  to the Escrow Agent in accordance with
Section 4(a);   (ii) the Total Option Holdback Amount and the Total

prior to the Effective Time, the  amount set forth opposite such payee\'s
name in Schedule "B"  less any applicable withholding taxes (including
amounts  withheld under Section 116 of the Canadian Tax Act) in respect  of
the Aggregate Preference Amount specified in the Closing  Date Tax
Direction;   (v) to the Company Securityholders listed in Schedule "C" who
held  Common Shares or Company Options immediately prior to the  Effective
Time, the amount set forth opposite such payee\'s  name in Schedule "C" less
any applicable withholding taxes in  respect of the Initial Consideration

specified by the Company, an amount equal to the  aggregate amount of
withholding taxes specified in the Closing  Date Tax Direction,   in each
case, within three (3) Business Days after receiving such  funds together
with the Closing Date Payment Direction and the  Closing Date Tax Direction;
provided, however, that in no event  shall the Depositary disburse funds to a
Company Securityholder  until such Company Securityholder has deposited with
the Depositary  certificate(s) and/or agreement(s), as applicable,
representing the  Shares and/or Company Options held by such Company
Securityholder,  which are accompanied by a signed and completed Letter of 
Transmittal substantially in the form attached as Schedule "D"  hereto, as
applicable.   (b) Unless otherwise specified in the Closing Date Payment
Direction,  the amounts paid to the Company Securityholders pursuant to
Sections  11.3(a)(iv) and (v) shall correspond to the amount set forth 
opposite each payee\'s name on Schedule "B" and/or Schedule "C" (less  any
applicable withholding taxes specified in the Closing Date Tax  Direction).
The Depositary shall pay such amounts by forwarding a  cheque by first class
mail (postage paid) to each such payee at the  address specified in the
Letter of Transmittal delivered by such  payee to the Depositary.   (c) The
Depositary will direct any Company Securityholders whose  certificate(s)
and/or agreement(s) representing such Company  Securityholder\'s Shares
and/or Company Options have been lost or  destroyed to submit a Letter of
Transmittal completed to the best of  such Company Securityholder\'s ability
and to submit a letter  describing the loss. Upon receipt of such statement
of loss or  destruction, the Depositary shall provide a copy of such
statement   23     to the Purchaser, which shall notify the affected
Company  Securityholder as to its replacement requirements.   (d) If a
Letter of Transmittal or other required document has been  improperly
completed or signed, or the certificate(s) representing  Shares accompanying
a Letter of Transmittal are not in proper form  for transfer to the
Purchaser, or some other irregularity in  connection with a deposit exists,
the Depositary will make  reasonable efforts to contact such Company
Securityholder to cause  such irregularity to be corrected.   (e) In the
event of any doubt on the part of the Depositary as to  whether any
certificate(s) and/or agreement(s) representing Shares  or Company Options
have been properly deposited, the Depositary will  seek the advice of the
Purchaser and its legal counsel as to the  acceptability of the deposit. If
reasonable efforts to correct an  improper deposit prove to be unsuccessful,
the Depositary will seek  the advice of the Purchaser and its legal counsel
with respect to  the procedures to be followed. The Depositary will reject
any  deposit if, in the opinion of the Purchaser\'s legal counsel, the 
deposit has been made improperly and the Depositary will take such  action
with respect to such improper deposit as directed by the  Purchaser or the
Purchaser\'s legal counsel, acting reasonably.   (f) Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, in the case  of the loss, theft or
destruction of a certificate and/or agreement  representing Shares or Company
Options, the holder of such  certificate and/or agreement must: (i) deliver a
properly completed  Letter of Transmittal together with a letter stating the
loss, theft  or destruction of such certificate and/or agreement; and (ii)
comply  with the Purchaser\'s replacement requirements, before receiving 
payment hereunder in respect of such Shares or Company Options. The 
Depositary shall not be required to release any amounts in respect  of any
Company Shares and/or Company Options in respect of which the  certificate(s)
and/or agreement(s) representing such Company Shares  and/or Company Options
have been lost or damaged unless and until it  receives confirmation from the
Purchaser that the affected Company  Securityholders have complied with the
Purchaser\'s replacement  requirements and that the Depositary is therefore
authorized and  instructed to release the authorized amounts.   (g) Upon
compliance with the provisions of this Section 11.3 and Article  5 of the
Plan of Arrangement, the Depositary will disburse the  applicable funds, less
any applicable withholding tax, to each  Company Securityholder listed on
Schedule "B" and Schedule "C", as  the case may be, in accordance with
section 5.1(d) of the Plan of  Arrangement.  11.4 First Escrow Release
Amount   (a) Upon the release by the Escrow Agent of the First Escrow
Release  Amount, if any, from the Escrow Fund to the Depositary at the
First  Release Time in accordance with Section 6(b), the Representative 
shall deliver a written instruction to the Depositary substantially  in the
form attached as Schedule "F" (the "FIRST ESCROW RELEASE  PAYMENT DIRECTION")
and the Purchaser shall deliver a written  instruction to the Depositary
specifying the amount of applicable  withholding taxes payable in respect of
each Company Securityholder  (the "FIRST ESCROW RELEASE TAX DIRECTION").  
(b) Unless otherwise specified in the First Escrow Release Payment 
Direction, the Depositary shall upon receipt of the First Escrow  Release
Amount:   24     (i) disburse to each Company Securityholder listed in
Schedule  "H", a percentage of the First Escrow Release Amount  calculated
in accordance with the percentage allocations set  forth opposite such
payee\'s name in Schedule "H" less any  applicable withholding taxes
specified in the written  instructions delivered by the Purchaser pursuant to
Section  11.4(a) above; and   (ii) deliver to an account specified by the
Company, an amount  equal to the aggregate amount of withholding taxes
specified  in the written instructions delivered by the Purchaser  pursuant
to Section 11.4(a) above.   (c) The Depositary will disburse the funds
referred to in Section  11.4(b)(i) above by forwarding a cheque by first
class mail (postage  paid) to each Company Securityholder listed in Schedule
"H" within  three (3) Business Days after receiving the applicable funds,
in  each case in accordance with the signed First Escrow Release Payment 
Direction; provided, however, that the Depositary shall disburse  funds to a
Company Securityholder only if such Company  Securityholder has deposited
with the Depositary, in compliance with  Section 11.3 above and Article 5 of
the Plan of Arrangement,  certificate(s) and/or agreement(s), instruments or
agreements, as  applicable, representing the Shares and/or Company Options
held by  such Company Securityholder or otherwise provided evidence 
satisfactory to the Depositary and the Purchaser of the loss, theft  or
destruction of such certificate(s) and/or agreement(s)  accompanied by a
signed and completed Letter of Transmittal and  otherwise complied with
Section 11.3 and Article 5 of the Plan of  Arrangement.  11.5 Release of
Balance of Escrow Fund   (a) Upon the release by the Escrow Agent of the
balance of the Escrow  Funds, if any, to the Depositary at the Second Release
Time in  accordance with Section 6(c), the Representative shall deliver a 
written instruction to the Depositary substantially in the form  attached as
Schedule "F" (the "SECOND ESCROW RELEASE PAYMENT  DIRECTION") and the
Purchaser shall deliver a written instruction to  the Depositary specifying
the amount of applicable withholding taxes  payable in respect of each
Company Securityholder (the "SECOND  ESCROW RELEASE TAX DIRECTION").   (b)
Unless otherwise specified in the Second Escrow Release Payment  Direction,
the Depositary shall upon receipt of the Second Escrow  Release Amount:  
(i) disburse to each Company Securityholder listed in Schedule  "H", a

made by the Depositary in the administration of such services and duties
(including the reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel and other
outside advisors required for discharge of its duties hereunder or other wise
in connection with this Agreement) (collectively, the "DEPOSITARY FEES"). The
Depositary shall provide an invoice with respect to Depositary Fees to the
Representative and the Representative shall direct that such Depositary Fees
be paid out of the Escrow Fund prior to the release of any amounts from the
Escrow Fund to the Company Securityholders. All Depositary Fees and out-of
pocket expenses will be paid within thirty days from the date of invoice.
Late payments may be subject to interest charges as indicated on the invoice.
The parties acknowledge and agree that the fees of the Depositary are
confidential information. As such, the parties agree not to disclose any such
fees to any third party without the Depositary\'s prior written consent, save
and except for disclosure: (i) to the parties\' professional advisors, held
to strict confidence; and (ii) as required or otherwise compelled by
law.  11.10 Depositary Liability.  The acceptance by the Depositary of its
duties under this Agreement is subject to the following terms and conditions
which shall govern and control the rights, duties, liabilities and immunities
of the Depositary:   (a) The Depositary is not a party to and is not bound
by any agreement  which may be evidenced by, or which may arise out of, the
foregoing  instructions other than as expressly set forth in this
Agreement.   (b) The Depositary shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted  by the Depositary pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement,  other than as a result of its own gross negligence or wilful 
misconduct, or that of its officers, directors, representatives or 
employees.   (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the  Depositary shall not be liable under any circumstances whatsoever  for
any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or aggravated  damages,
including damages for loss of profit, arising from any  action taken or
omitted under this Agreement.   (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the liability  of the Depositary under this Agreement shall
be limited, in the  aggregate, to the amount of Depositary Fees paid to the
Depositary  in respect of the twelve (12) month period ending on the date
on  which a party to this Agreement first brings or commences a claim, 
action or proceeding against the Depositary.   (e) In addition to and
without limiting any other protection of the  Depositary hereunder or
otherwise by law, the Company, the Purchaser  and the Parent shall jointly
and severally indemnify and hold the  Depositary and its directors, officers
and employees harmless from  and against any and all liabilities, losses,
claims, damages,  penalties, actions, suits, demands, levies, costs, expenses
and  disbursements including any and all reasonable legal and adviser  fees
and disbursements of whatever kind or nature which may at any  time be
suffered by, imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the  Depositary,
whether groundless or otherwise, howsoever arising from  or out of any act,
omission or error of the Depositary in connection   28     with its
acting as Depositary hereunder unless arising from the  gross negligence or
wilful misconduct of the Depositary, or that of  its officers, directors,
representatives or employees.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
this indemnity shall  survive the removal, or resignation of the Depositary,
and  termination of this Agreement.   (f) In the event of any claim, action
or proceeding brought or commenced  against the Depositary, the Depositary
shall notify the  Representative as soon as practicable after it receives
written  notice of such claim or has been served with a summons or other 
legal process, which notice will attach such claim, action or  proceeding or
provide information as to the nature and basis of such  claim, action or
proceeding. The Representative shall, upon the  prior written direction and
consent of the Depositary, undertake the  investigation and defence of any
such claim, action or proceeding.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Depositary shall have the right  to retain other counsel to act on its behalf
if the Depositary  reasonably determines that a conflict of interest or
other  circumstance in which its best interests would not adequately be 
represented exists that would make representation by counsel chosen  by the
Representative inadvisable.   (g) If at any time in the performance of its
duties under this Agreement  it shall be necessary for the Depositary to
receive, accept, act or  rely upon any certificate, notice, request, waiver,
consent,  receipt, direction, affidavit or other paper, writing or document 
furnished to it and purporting to have been executed or issued by  the
Representative, the Depositary may rely upon any instructions,  instrument,
certificate, report or paper believed by the Depositary  to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper  person(s) and shall be under no
duty to make any investigation or  inquiry as to any signature or statement
contained therein, but may  accept the same as having been properly given and
as conclusive  evidence of the truth and accuracy of any statements therein 
contained.   (h) None of the provisions contained in this Agreement or any
supplement  shall require the Depositary to expend or risk its own funds or 
otherwise incur financial liability in performing its duties or in  the
exercise of any of its rights or powers. The Depositary shall  not be
required to make any payment or disburse any funds unless and  until it has
received the necessary funds to make such payment or  disbursement.   (i)
The Depositary shall have the right to disclose any information  disclosed or
released to it if in the opinion of the Depositary, or  its legal counsel, it
is required to disclose such information under  any applicable Laws, Judgment
or administrative directions. The  Depositary shall not be responsible or
liable to any person for any  loss or damage arising out of or in any way
sustained or incurred or  in any way relating to such disclosure.   (j) The
Depositary may appoint such agents and employ or retain such  counsel,
accountants, engineers, appraisers or other experts or  advisers as it may
reasonably require for the purpose of discharging  its duties hereunder or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement  and shall not be responsible for
any misconduct on the part of any  of them. The Depositary may pay
remuneration for all services  performed for it in the discharge of its
duties hereunder without  taxation for costs or fees of any counsel,
solicitor or attorney.  The advice or opinion of any legal counsel so
retained by the  Depositary shall be full and complete authorization and
protection  in respect of any action or omission taken in good faith by the 
Depositary in reliance upon such advice or opinion.   29     (k) The
Depositary may act and rely and shall be protected in acting and  relying on
in good faith on the opinion or advice of or information  obtained from any
agent, counsel, accountant, engineer, appraiser or  other expert or adviser,
whether retained or employed by the  Representative or the Depositary, in
relation to any matter arising  in the performance of its duties under this
Agreement.   (l) In the event of any disagreement between any of the parties
hereto  resulting in adverse claims or demands with respect to the Escrow 
Fund, the Aggregate Holdback Amount, the Remaining Holdback Amount  and/or
any interest or earnings on any of such amounts  (collectively, the
"TRANSACTION FUNDS") or any portion thereof, the  Depositary shall be
entitled, at its option, to refuse to comply  with any claims or demands on
it with respect thereto as long as  such disagreement shall continue, and in
so refusing, the Depositary  may elect to make no delivery of the Transaction
Funds or any  portion thereof held by it. In so doing, the Depositary shall
not be  or become liable in any way to the parties hereto (including the 
Company Securityholders) for its failure or refusal to comply with  such
claims or demands. The Depositary shall be entitled to refrain  from acting
until such claims or demands:   (i) shall have been finally determined in a
court of competent  jurisdiction; or   (ii) shall have been settled by
agreement and the Depositary shall  have been so notified thereof by the
Representative and the  Purchaser in writing.   (m) The Depositary may pay
the Transaction Funds into a court of  competent jurisdiction for a
determination by such court as to the  entitlement to the Transaction Funds
at any time and shall thereupon  be released from any obligation
hereunder.   (n) Upon the Depositary\'s delivery or deposit of the full
amount of the  Transaction Funds in accordance with the provisions of this 
Agreement, the Depositary shall be automatically and immediately  released
from all obligations under this Agreement to any party  hereto and to any
other Person with respect to the Transaction Funds  or any portion
thereof.   (o) The Depositary shall not be liable, or held in breach of
this  Agreement, if prevented, hindered, or delayed in the performance or 
observance of any provision contained herein by reason of any act of  God,
riot, terrorism, act of war, epidemic, governmental action,  judicial order,
earthquake, power failure, sabotage, explosion,  civil commotion, strike or
industrial action of any kind,  unavailability of any system, or any other
similar cause beyond its  reasonable control (including, but not limited to,
mechanical,  electronic or communication interruptions, disruptions or
failures).  Performance times under this Agreement shall be extended for a 
period of time equivalent or reasonably related to the time lost  because of
any delay that is excusable under this section  11.11 Resignation or Removal
of the Depositary  The Depositary may resign from its position at any time
upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Representative. In
addition, the Purchaser and the Representative may jointly remove the
Depositary at any time without cause, by an instrument given to the
Depositary, which instrument shall designate the effective date of such
removal. Upon such resignation or removal, the Depositary shall take such
steps as are necessary to transfer any Transaction Funds and
any documentation related thereto deposited with it to a successor depositary
as selected by the Representative and agreed to by the Purchaser,
acting reasonably, and, where   30    such successor depositary is not
so selected within seven (7) Business Days of the Depositary\'s resignation
or removal, then to any court of competent jurisdiction. Upon such
resignation or removal, the Depositary shall be discharged of and from any
and all further obligations arising in connection with this Agreement other
than to retain and safeguard the Transaction Funds and any documentation then
in its possession until receipt of a designation of successor depositary or a
joint written disposition instruction by or on behalf of the Purchaser and
the Representative or a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.  12. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING/ANTI-TERRORIST LEGISLATION  Each
of the Company (without making any inquiry of the Company
Securityholders), the Purchaser and the Parent hereby represents and
covenants to the Escrow Agent and the Depositary in respect of any account to
be opened by, or interest to be held by, the Escrow Agent or the Depositary
in connection with this Agreement, for or to the credit of such party, that
either: (i) such account is not intended to be used by or on behalf of any
third party; or (ii) if such account is intended to be used by or on behalf
of a third party, the Company, the Purchaser, the Parent and the
Representative, as applicable, will complete and execute forthwith a
declaration in the Escrow Agent\'s prescribed form as to the particulars of
such third party.  Each of the Escrow Agent and the Depositary shall retain
the right not to act and shall not be liable for refusing to act if, due to a
lack of information or for any other reason whatsoever, the Escrow Agent or
the Depositary, as the case may be, in its sole judgment, determines that
such act might cause it to be in non-compliance with any applicable anti-
money laundering or anti-terrorist legislation, regulation or guideline.
Further, should either of the Escrow Agent or the Depositary, in its sole
judgment, determine at any time that its acting under this Agreement has
resulted in its being in non-compliance with any applicable anti-money
laundering or anti-terrorist legislation, regulation or guideline, then it
shall have the right to resign on ten (10) days written notice to the
Representative and the Purchaser, provided that:   (a) the written notice of
the Escrow Agent or the Depositary, as the  case may be, describes the
circumstances of such non-compliance; and   (b) if such circumstances are
rectified to the satisfaction of the  Escrow Agent or Depositary, as the case
may be, within such ten (10)  day period, then such resignation shall not be
effective.  13. INTEREST   (a) The Company Securityholders will be treated
as the owners of the  Escrow Fund for purposes of any taxes based on income.
The Company  Securityholders will report all income, if any, that is earned
on,  or derived from, the Escrow Fund as income in the taxable year or 
years in which such income is properly includable and pay any taxes 
attributable thereto.   (b) Each Remaining Employee will be treated as the
owner of his or her  applicable portion of the Aggregate Holdback Amount in
respect of  such Remaining Employee for purposes of any taxes based on
income.  The Remaining Employees will report all income, if any, that is 
earned on, or derived from, the applicable Aggregate Holdback Amount  as
income in the taxable year or years in which such income is  properly
includable and pay any taxes attributable thereto.   (c) Each Remaining
Securityholder will be treated as the owner of the  applicable portion of the
Remaining Holdback Amount in respect of  such Remaining Securityholder for
purposes of   31     any taxes based on income. The Remaining
Securityholders will report  all income, if any, that is earned on, or
derived from, the  applicable Remaining Holdback Amount as income in the
taxable year  or years in which such income is properly includable and pay
any  taxes attributable thereto.  14. WITHHOLDING TAX MATTERS   (a)
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, the  Escrow
Agent and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and  withhold from any
amount otherwise payable to any Purchaser  Indemnified Party or Company
Securityholder pursuant to this  Agreement such amounts as the Escrow Agent
or the Depositary, as the  case may be, is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to such  payment under the Canadian Tax Act, the Code or any
provision of  federal, provincial, state, local or foreign tax laws, in each
case,  as amended or succeeded. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, 
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having  been paid
to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Company  Securityholders
in respect of which such deduction and withholding  was made, provided that
such withheld amounts are actually remitted  to the appropriate taxing
authority. The Purchaser and the Company  Securityholders shall use
commercially reasonable efforts as soon as  reasonably practicable provide to
the Escrow Agent or Depositary, as  applicable, such information or tax forms
as the Escrow Agent or  Depositary reasonably requests in connection with its
obligations  under the appropriate tax laws and/or regulations applicable
in  respect of withholding, backup withholding and information reporting 
including, without limitation, tax identification numbers (if any)  for any
Purchaser Indemnified Party, the Representative and each of  the Company
Securityholders and Forms W-9 or W-8. Any amount  deducted or withheld
pursuant to section 116 of the Canadian Tax Act  from any Purchaser
Indemnified Party or Company Securityholder who  is a non-resident of Canada
or has not certified that it is resident  in Canada for income tax purposes
(a "NON-RESIDENT HOLDER") shall be  remitted either (a) to the relevant
taxing authority on the last  business day of the period within which
remittance is required or  (b) to such Non-Resident Holder upon delivery by
such Non-Resident  Holder to the Purchaser of a clearance certificate
acceptable to the  Purchaser, acting reasonably, issued pursuant to section
116 of the  Canadian Tax Act having a certificate limit not less than the
full  amount of the consideration to be paid to such Non-Resident Holder 
pursuant to the terms hereof, whichever shall first occur.  Notwithstanding
that the time for remittance of amounts deducted or  withheld in respect of
any such Non-Resident Holder has occurred  without an acceptable clearance
certificate being provided, if the  Purchaser is provided with a letter
acceptable to the Purchaser from  CRA advising that all or any portion (the
"PORTION") of the amounts  deducted or withheld pursuant to section 116 of
the Canadian Tax Act  in respect of such Non-Resident Holder is not required
to be  remitted at that time, such amounts will continue to be held in 
accordance with that letter until such a clearance certificate is  provided
or until CRA requires the Portion to be remitted, whichever  shall first
occur.   (b) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the
Depositary  shall not be responsible for any tax processing relating to or 
arising from the duties or actions contemplated by this Agreement,  including
evaluation, reporting, remittance, filing, and issuance of  tax slips,
summaries and reports, except as is specifically  delegated to the Depositary
pursuant to this Agreement or as may be  subsequently agreed by the parties.
The Depositary shall be entitled  to rely upon and assume, without further
inquiry or verification,  the accuracy and   32     completeness of any
tax processing information, documentation or  instructions received by
Depositary, directly or indirectly, from  the Purchaser or the
Company.  15. INTERPLEADER  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall have the right at any time to interplead
the parties and deposit the Escrow Fund or any other document or monies
deposited with it with any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of
any dispute as to, or if the Escrow Agent in its sole discretion shall
conclude that there is, a bona fide question, confusion or dispute in respect
of or as to any matter under this Agreement including, without limitation,
the holding or delivery of the Escrow Fund, the duties of the Escrow Agent in
respect of any other matter arising hereunder or the validity,
enforceability, extent of enforceability or meaning of any provision of this
Agreement and any such deposit shall wholly discharge the obligations of the
Escrow Agent under this Agreement in respect of the Escrow Fund and any
such other document or monies, and shall for all purposes hereof be deemed
good and sufficient fulfilment by the Escrow Agent of all of its obligations
hereunder.  16. MISCELLANEOUS   (a) All notices and other communications

Purchaser, and their representatives and agents, to segregate and  deduct
their respective portion of the Aggregate Escrow Amount and,  where
applicable, the Option Holdback Amount, Exercising Shareholder  Holdback
Amount or Representative Holdback Amount from the amount  payable to each
such Company Shareholder and holder of Company  Options and, in the case of
the Aggregate Escrow Amount, Option  Holdback Amount or Exercising
Shareholder Holdback Amount, to  deposit such amount with the Escrow Agent to
be held and disbursed  in accordance with the Indemnification and Escrow
Agreement and, in  the case of the Representative Holdback Amount, to deliver
such  amount to the Representative\'s legal counsel in accordance with 
Section 11.2(c) of the Indemnification and Escrow Agreement; and   (m) in
accordance with the Indemnification and Escrow Agreement, each  Company
Securityholder will be: (i) deemed to have irrevocably  appointed and
authorized the Representative, as agent of such  Company Securityholder, to
enter into and act under the  Indemnification and Escrow Agreement on his
behalf in the manner  contemplated in the Indemnification and Escrow
Agreement; and (ii)  deemed to have irrevocably authorized the Representative
to deal  with the Escrow Agent, the Depositary, the Escrow Fund and, where 
applicable, the Option Holdback Amount or Exercising Shareholder  Holdback
Amount in accordance with the terms of the Indemnification  and Escrow
Agreement.  3.2 FINAL CONSIDERATION   (a) Upon the final determination of
the Actual Gross Profit Dollars,  Final Consideration and the Final Per Share
Consideration  conclusively in accordance with Section 3.2(b), the amount
payable  pursuant to Sections 3.1(c)(B), 3.1(g)(ii) and 3.1(h)(iii) will be 
adjusted and reduced, if necessary, to equal the Final Per Share 
Consideration and the Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be  delivered by
wire transfer to the Depositary payment in the amount  of the Final
Consideration no later than 10 Business Days after the  date of the final
determination of such amount in full satisfaction  of the amount payable
pursuant to Sections 3.1(c)(B), 3.1(g)(ii) and  3.1(h)(iii), as the case may
be. The Final Consideration shall be  disbursed by the Depositary to each
former holder of Shares and each  former holder of Company Options in an
amount per Share or Company  Option, as the case may be, equal to the Final
Per Share  Consideration in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.1
of  this Plan of Arrangement and the Indemnification and Escrow 
Agreement.   (b) The Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to
determine  and to deliver to the Representative copies of the Purchaser\'s 
computations of the Actual Gross Profit Dollars, Final Consideration  and the
Final Per Share Consideration within 30 days after the end  of the
Calculation Period. The Representative shall notify the  Purchaser in writing
within 30 days following receipt of such  calculations (the "REVIEW PERIOD")
of the Representative\'s  acceptance of or disagreement with the Purchaser\'s
calculations of  the Actual Gross Profit Dollars, Final Consideration and the
Final  Per Share Consideration. Failure by the Representative to notify the 
Purchaser of either acceptance of or disagreement with the   12    
Purchaser\'s calculations of the Actual Gross Profit Dollars, Final 
Consideration and the Final Per Share Consideration shall be deemed 
acceptance thereof. If the Representative disagrees with the  Purchaser\'s
calculations of the Actual Gross Profit Dollars, Final  Consideration and the
Final Per Share Consideration, the  Representative shall, prior to the
expiration of the Review Period,  notify the Purchaser in writing of such
disagreement and deliver  with such notice the Representative\'s proposed
calculations of the  Actual Gross Profit Dollars, Final Consideration and the
Final Per  Share Consideration. The Purchaser shall have a period of 20
days  after delivery of the Representative\'s proposed calculations of the 
Actual Gross Profit Dollars, Final Consideration and the Final Per  Share
Consideration to review such proposed calculations. If the  Purchaser
disputes the Representative\'s proposed calculations, then  the Purchaser and
the Representative shall engage an independent  public accounting firm of
U.S. national reputation (other than the  auditors of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Date or  the auditors of the Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates) to  resolve the dispute and conclusively determine the
Actual Gross  Profit Dollars, Final Consideration and the Final Per Share 
Consideration, which determination shall be final and binding upon  all
parties, including the Company Shareholders and the former  holders of
Company Options. The fees and expenses of such accounting  firm shall be paid
one-half by the Purchaser and one-half by the  Company Shareholders and
former holders of Company Options out of  the Escrow Amount.   (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Shareholders and holders  of
Company Options acknowledge that: (i) subject to the terms of the 
Arrangement Agreement, upon the completion of the transactions  contemplated
by the Arrangement Agreement, the Purchaser and the  Parent may operate the
business of the Acquired Companies and their  respective businesses in any
way consistent with the Purchaser\'s and  the Parent\'s reasonable business
judgment, but not inconsistent with  the covenants and agreements contained
in the Arrangement Agreement,  in order to maximize the value of its
consolidated businesses as a  whole, including the Affiliates of the
Purchaser; provided that, the  Purchaser and the Parent will act in good
faith in connection with  the operation of the Acquired Companies
businesses\' efforts and the  business efforts of the Affiliates of the
Parent to achieve the  Final Consideration, taking into account both the long
and short  term objectives of its consolidated businesses as a whole,
including  its business reputation with customers, stockholders and
financing  partners and the Affiliates of the Purchaser; (ii) the Final 
Consideration is speculative and is subject to numerous factors  outside the
control of the Purchaser and the Parent; and (iii) the  Purchaser and the
Parent owe no fiduciary duty or express or implied  duty to the former
Company Shareholders or former holders of Company  Options who may receive
the Final Consideration, if any, other than  as expressly provided in the
Arrangement Agreement.   (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the provisions of  this Section 3.2 shall survive the closing of
the transactions  contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement.   (e) Solely
for the purpose of confirming the computations of Final  Consideration and
Final Per Share Consideration, the Purchaser shall  provide the
Representative with reasonable access to all necessary  supporting financial
and other business records of the Purchaser,  the Parent and the Company as
the Representative may reasonably  request (subject to any confidentiality
agreements or covenants  relating to such information). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the  Purchaser, the Parent and the Company shall not be required
to  disclose any information, records, files or other data to the 
Representative where prohibited by applicable Laws.   13    3.3 EXCHANGE
RATE  For purposes of Section 3.1 and the calculation of the amounts under
Section 3.1(c), any Exercise Price in respect of options to purchase Class A
Common Shares granted under the Company Stock Option Plan that is denominated
in Canadian Dollars shall be converted into U.S. Dollars using the Exchange
Rate.  3.4 LIQUIDATION EVENT AND LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE  The Arrangement
shall be deemed to constitute a "Liquidation Event" (as such term is defined
in the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attached to the
Preference Shares (the "PREFERENCE SHARE RIGHTS") set out in Schedule "A" to
the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company dated December 10,
2001 and filed with Industry Canada on December 18, 2001) and the
Aggregate Preference Amount paid to the holders of the Preference Shares in
accordance with this Plan of Arrangement shall be deemed to constitute
payment of the "Liquidation Preference" (as such term is defined in the
Preference Share Rights) to the holders of the Preference Shares.   ARTICLE
4  RIGHTS OF DISSENT  4.1 RIGHTS OF DISSENT  None of the Company
Securityholders or the holders of any other securities referred to in Section
3.1(b), in each case, at the Effective Time, shall have any rights of dissent

AND AGREEMENTS  5.1 PAYMENT OF CONSIDERATION   (a) At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Purchaser shall deposit, or  cause to be deposited, with
the Depositary, for the benefit of the  Company Shareholders and the holders
of Company Options, cash in the  aggregate amount equal to the net payments
contemplated by Section  3.1 to be made at and as of the Effective Time for
disbursement in  accordance with the Indemnification and Escrow
Agreement.   (b) With respect to Shares, upon surrender to the Depositary
for  cancellation of a certificate or certificates which immediately  prior
to the Effective Time represented Shares that were exchanged  under the
Arrangement, together with a duly completed Letter of  Transmittal and with
such other documents and instruments as would  have been required to effect
the transfer of the Shares formerly  represented by such certificate or
certificates under the CBCA and  the by-laws of the Company, and such
additional documents and  instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the Company  Shareholder surrendering such certificate or
certificates shall be  entitled to receive in exchange therefor the net cash
payment,  rounded up to the nearest whole cent, which such Company
Shareholder  is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 and in
accordance  with the Indemnification and Escrow Agreement, and the
certificate  or certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  
14     (c) With respect to Company Options, as soon as practicable
following  the later of the Effective Date and the surrender of the
instrument  or agreement representing a holder\'s Company Options, together
with  a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and such additional documents 
and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, such  holder shall
be entitled to receive the net cash payment, rounded up  to the nearest whole
cent, which such holder is entitled to receive  pursuant to Section 3.1 and
in accordance with the Indemnification  and Escrow Agreement.   (d) Subject
to Section 5.3, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable  following the
later of the Effective Date and the date of deposit  with the Depositary of

the case may be, at the address specified in the Letter of  Transmittal;
or   (ii) if requested by the Company Shareholder or holder of Company 
Options, as the case may be, in the Letter of Transmittal,  make available at
the Depositary for pick-up by the Company  Shareholder or the holder of
Company Options, as the case may  be; or   (iii) if the Letter of
Transmittal neither specifies an address nor  contains a request as described
in clause (ii) above, forward  or cause to be forwarded by first class mail
(postage paid) to  the Company Shareholder or holder of Company Options, as
the  case may be, at the last known address of such Company  Shareholder or
holder of Company Options as shown on the  Company\'s records,   a cheque
representing the net cash payment, if any, payable to such  Company
Shareholder or holder of Company Options, as the case may  be, in accordance
with the provisions hereof and the Indemnification  and Escrow Agreement.  
(e) No Company Shareholder or holder of Company Options at the Effective 
Time shall be entitled to receive any consideration with respect to  the
Shares or Company Options, respectively, other than net cash  payment
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent), if any, which the  Company
Shareholders and holders or Company Options are entitled to  receive in
accordance with Section 3.1 and, for greater certainty,  no Company
Shareholder or holder of Company Options will be entitled  to receive any
interest, dividends, premium or other payment in  connection therewith.  
(f) Until such time as a former Company Shareholder complies with the 
provisions of Section 5.1(b) or 5.2, the net cash payment (rounded  up to the
nearest whole cent), if any, to which such Company  Shareholder is entitled
shall, subject to Section 5.3, be paid to  the Depositary to be held in trust
for such Company Shareholder for  delivery to the Company Shareholder, with
interest, if any, earned  thereon accrued and payable to the Company
Shareholder, upon deposit  with the Depositary of the documentation as
provided in Section  5.1(b) or 5.2.   (g) Until such time as a former
holder of Company Options complies with  the provisions of Section 5.1(c) or

Depositary  to be held in trust for such holder for delivery to the holder,
with  interest, if any, earned thereon   15     accrued and payable to
the holder, upon deposit with the Depositary  of the documentation as
provided in Section 5.1(c) or 5.2.   (h) Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 5.1, each  certificate or other instrument which immediately
prior to the  Effective Date represented Shares or Company Options shall be
deemed  at all times following the Effective Time to represent only the 
right to receive upon such surrender the net cash payment (rounded  up to the
nearest whole cent) which the holder thereof is entitled  to receive pursuant
to the provisions hereof and the Indemnification  and Escrow
Agreement.  5.2 LOST CERTIFICATES  In the event any certificate,
instrument or agreement which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Shares or Company Options that were
transferred or surrendered, terminated and cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon providing such indemnity as
the Purchaser or the Depositary may reasonably require and the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate, instrument or
agreement to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, instrument
or agreement, the net cash payment (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
which such Company Shareholder or holder of Company Options, as the case may
be, is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1. When authorizing such
payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, instrument
or agreement, the Person to whom the payment is made shall, as a condition
precedent to the delivery thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the Purchaser
and the Depositary in such sum as the Purchaser may reasonably direct or
otherwise indemnify the Purchaser and the Company in a manner satisfactory to
the Purchaser against any claim that may be made against the Purchaser or the
Company with respect to the certificate, instrument or agreement alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.  5.3 EXTINCTION OF RIGHTS  If any
holder of Shares or Company Options fails for any reason to deliver to the
Depositary for cancellation the certificates formerly representing Shares
or the instrument or agreement formerly representing Company Options (or
an affidavit of loss and bond or other indemnity pursuant to Section 5.2),
together with such other documents or instruments required for such holder to
receive payment for Shares or Company Options, on or before the later of the
first anniversary of the Effective Date or such other date as may be require
in order to obtain the Final Order, certificates formerly representing Shares
or the instrument or agreement formerly representing Company Options shall
cease to represent an entitlement to receive the consideration specified in
Section 3.1. On such date, the cash amount to which the former holder of the
certificates, instrument or agreement referred to in the preceding sentence
was entitled, shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no consideration
to the other Company Shareholders and holders of Company Options and shall be
paid into the Escrow Fund and distributed to the other Company Shareholders
and holders of Company Options pro rata in accordance with the terms of the
Indemnification and Escrow Agreement. None of the Company, the Purchaser, the
Parent, the Representative or the Depositary shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash paid in accordance with the foregoing. For purposes of
determining the amount that a particular Company Shareholder or holder of
Company Options is entitled to receive pursuant to the foregoing, "pro rata"
shall be determined by reference by the total number of Shares or Company
Options held by the particular Company Shareholder or holder of Company
Options at the last moment in time prior to the Effective Time as compared to
the total number of Shares and Company Options held by all Company
Shareholders and holders of Company Options entitled to receive a portion of
the surrendered amount referred above at such time.   16    5.4
WITHHOLDING RIGHTS  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
herein, the Company, the Purchaser and the Depositary shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any holders
of Shares or Company Options under this Plan of Arrangement, such amounts as
the Company, the Purchaser or the Depositary is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under the Canadian Tax Act, the Code or
any provision of federal, provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in
each case, as amended or succeeded. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having
been paid to the holder of Shares or Company Options, as the case may be, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such
withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.
The Purchaser and the Company Securityholders shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to as soon as reasonably practicable provide the Escrow
Agent or Depositary, as applicable, such information or tax forms as
the Escrow Agent or Depositary reasonably requests in connection with
its obligations under the appropriate tax laws and/or regulations applicable
in respect of withholding, backup withholding and information reporting
including, without limitation, tax identification numbers (if any) for any
Purchaser Indemnified Party, the Representative and each of the Company
Securityholders and Forms W-9 and W8. Any amount deducted or withheld
pursuant to section 116 of the Canadian Tax Act from any holder of Shares or
Company Options who is a non-resident of Canada or has not certified that he
is resident in Canada for income tax purposes (a "NON-RESIDENT HOLDER") shall
be remitted either: (i) to the relevant taxing authority on the last business
day of the period within which remittance is required; or (ii) to such Non-
Resident Holder upon delivery by such Non-Resident Holder to the Purchaser or
the Depositary of a clearance certificate acceptable to the Purchaser or the
Depositary, as the case may be, acting reasonably, issued pursuant to section
116 of the Canadian Tax Act having a certificate limit not less than the full
amount of the consideration to be paid to such Non-Resident Holder pursuant
to the terms hereof, whichever shall first occur. Notwithstanding that the
time for remittance of amounts deducted or withheld in respect of any such
Non-Resident Holder has occurred without an acceptable clearance certificate
being provided to the Purchaser or the Depositary, if the Purchaser or the
Depositary is provided with a letter acceptable to the Purchaser or the
Depositary, as the case may be, acting reasonably, from CRA advising that all
or any portion (the "PORTION") of the amounts deducted or withheld pursuant
to section 116 of the Canadian Tax Act in respect of such Non-Resident Holder
is not required to be remitted at that time, the Purchaser or the Depositary
will continue to hold such Portion in accordance with that letter until such
a clearance certificate is provided or until CRA requires the Portion to be
remitted, whichever shall first occur. For purposes of the foregoing, the
Depositary shall act as the agent for the Purchaser for purposes of
deducting, withholding and remitting any amounts required to be deducted,
withheld or remitted in respect of a Non-Resident Holder.   ARTICLE 6

other  prior notice or communication, and if so proposed and accepted by 
the Company Securityholders voting at the Company Meeting (other  than as may
be required under the Interim Order), shall become part  of this Plan of
Arrangement for all purposes.   (c) Any amendment, modification and/or

financial or economic interests of any  Company Securityholder, or (ii) is
made with the written consent of  the Representative. The Company shall
