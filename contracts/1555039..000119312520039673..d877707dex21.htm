1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and
into Merger Sub and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall
thereupon cease. Merger Sub shall be the surviving company in the Merger (in
such capacity, sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Company_
") and shall continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall
have the effects specified in the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "
_MGCL_ ") and the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (the " _MLLCA_ ").

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
(i) at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York,

three (3) Business Days, following the day on which the last to be satisfied
or waived of each of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) at such other
place and/or on such other date as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree
in writing; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing in no event shall
the Closing occur prior to the date that is sixty days after the date hereof.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day
of the year on which banks are not required or authorized by Law to close in
New York City. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to
as the " _Closing Date_ ".

1.3 _Effective Time_. Immediately following the Closing, the Company and
Parent will cause the articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the "
_Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the " _SDAT_ ") as
provided in the MGCL and the MLLCA. The Merger shall become effective at the
time when the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT or at
such later time (not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date the Articles of
Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT) as may be agreed upon by the
parties hereto in writing and set forth in the Articles of Merger in
accordance with the MGCL and the MLLCA (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

ARTICLE II

ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS

OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY

 

2.1 _The Articles of Organization of the Surviving Company_. At the Effective
Time, the articles of organization of Merger Sub (the " _Articles_ ") shall

subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, except that the name of the Surviving
Company shall be such name as Parent may designate.

2.2 _The Operating Agreement of the Surviving Company_. At the Effective
Time, the operating agreement of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain unchanged and shall be the operating agreement of
the Surviving Company (the " _Operating Agreement_ "), until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to _Section_ __ _
6.11_, except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be such name as

ARTICLE III

 

MANAGER OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY

 

3.1 _Manager of Surviving Company_. The parties hereto shall take all actions

accordance with the Articles and the Operating Agreement.

 

ARTICLE IV

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON SECURITIES;

per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ " and each, a " _Share_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Company Subsidiary (each such Share, an "
_Excluded Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be
converted into the right to receive $12.50 per Share in cash without interest
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and (A) each
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares
(other than the Excluded Shares) and (B) each book-entry account formerly

each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder thereof, cease to
be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist.

(b) _Merger Sub_. Each membership interest of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
as one membership interest of the Surviving Company, such that immediately
following the Merger, Parent shall continue as the sole member and equity
holder of the Surviving Company.

4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
(the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares), an aggregate amount of cash comprising 

 



3

    

 the amounts required to be delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ in
respect of Shares (such aggregate amount of cash being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund
as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that (i) such investments shall be an
obligation of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks (collectively, the " _Permitted Investments_ ") and (ii) no such
investment (or losses thereon) shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.1(a)_. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments,
or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt cash payment of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost
through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash
payments. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent
shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (which confirmation of satisfaction
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to effect the
applicable terms of this Agreement.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within four (4) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates (other than Excluded
Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, and specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) and instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_). Upon
the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent in accordance with
the terms of such transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount by check after giving
effect to any required Tax withholding provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_
equal to the cash amount that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in
each case, reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental
Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.

 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parents option, to Parent. Any holder
of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with
this _ARTICLE IV_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any
payment of cash (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) upon due surrender of its Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section_ __
_ 4.2(e)_), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Company, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar federal, state, local, foreign or transnational law,
statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule or regulation (collectively, "
_Laws_ "). To the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately prior to the
date any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration shall become
the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Paying Agent
or the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration that would have been issuable or payable pursuant to the
provisions of this _ARTICLE IV_ (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) had such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company,
the Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Company, the Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may
be, and timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted
or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

(g) _Uncertificated Shares_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within four (4) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to (i) mail to each holder of Uncertificated Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) materials advising such holder of the effectiveness of the
Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and (ii) deliver the cash that such holder is entitled to
receive in respect of its Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
4.2(f)_), without interest thereon.

for any such Shares, in each case issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a distribution, reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,

as a foreign legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Parent has made available to
the Company complete and correct copies of the articles of formation and
operating agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as amended to and
in effect on the date of this Agreement.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means
any event, change, circumstance or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, prevents, materially delays, materially impairs or has a material
adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including obtaining the financing necessary
to pay the Merger Consideration).

 

(b) _Authorized Capital Stock_. All of the issued and outstanding membership

Sub convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities or other
voting securities of Merger Sub and (iii) no options or other rights to

and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception. No approval by the equityholder of Parent is required in
order for Parent to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

 

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

 

(i) Other than the necessary filings, notices, reports, consents,

delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and/or
the consummation by Parent of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except, in each case, those that the failure to make or
obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



34

    

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub does not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or
result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the respective
articles of formation and operating agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, (B)
with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, a breach or
violation of, a default or termination or modification (or right of
termination or modification) under, payment of additional fees under, the
creation or acceleration of any obligations under, or the creation of a Lien
on any of the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any
Contract binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or, assuming (solely

and the other transactions contemplated hereby) the filings, notices, reports,
consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods

Agreement, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

_Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries or the Companys and its Subsidiaries directors, officers
and employees, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its

any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;

 

(ii) enter into, engage in, continue or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (A) regarding any Acquisition Proposal or (B)
that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal (in each
case other than, solely in response to an inquiry that did not result from or
arise in connection with a breach of this Section 6.2(a), to refer the
inquiring person to this Agreement and to limit its conversation or other
communication exclusively to such referral);

(iii) provide any information or data concerning the Company or any of its

records or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection

unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, (i) provide access to non-public
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person and
its potential sources of financing who made such Acquisition Proposal;

Parent or is provided to Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) following the time such information is made available to such
Person and that, prior to furnishing any such non-public information, the
Company receives from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all material
respects on such Person as the Confidentiality Agreements

 



43

    

 terms are on Parent (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement
need not prohibit the making or amending of an Acquisition Proposal) and (ii)
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person
regarding such Acquisition Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking any
action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, (1) the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that (A) based on the information then available and after
consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
(B) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
duties under applicable Law and (2) with respect to clause (ii) above, the
Company provides written notice to Parent at least twenty-four (24) hours
prior to engaging or participating in any discussions or negotiations with any
such Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

fide inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
that would be reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are
received by the Company, (ii) any information is requested in connection with
any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any discussions or negotiation with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or that would be reasonably expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with the
Company, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person
and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including
providing copies of any written materials delivered by such Person) and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions
or negotiations (including delivery to Parent within twenty-four (24) hours of
copies of all written materials and communications delivered by or on behalf
of such Person in connection with such proposal or offer).

consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets of the Company and (ii)
any acquisition by any Person or group (as defined in or under Section 13 of

interest, which if consummated would result in, any Person becoming
the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of
related transactions, fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding Shares,
or fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income
or total assets of the Company, or any tender offer (including a self-tender
offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person
beneficially owning more than fifteen percent (15%) of the Shares, in each
case, other than the transactions with Parent contemplated by this Agreement.

 



44

    

" _Intervening Event_ " means a material effect that (i) was not known to, or
reasonably foreseeable by, the board of directors of the Company prior to the

and (ii) does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that
"Intervening Event" shall exclude any effect related to (A) any Acquisition
Proposal or other inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B) an effect resulting from a
breach of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C)
changes in the price of the Shares, in and of itself (however, the underlying
reasons for such changes may constitute an Intervening Event unless excluded
by any other exclusion in this definition), (D) the fact that, in and of
itself, the Company exceeds any internal or published projections, estimates
or expectations of the Companys revenue, earnings or other financial
performance or results of operations for any period, in and of itself (
_provided_ , that the underlying reasons for such events may constitute an
Intervening Event unless excluded by any other exclusion in this definition)
or (E) an event that relates solely to Parent.

the outstanding Shares (or of the stock of the surviving entity in a merger
or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or a
majority of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
which the Companys board of directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) to be (i)
more favorable to the holders of Shares from a financial point of view than
the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of, and the
likelihood of completion of, such proposal and this Agreement (including, if
applicable at the time of such determination, any changes to the financial
terms of this Agreement then proposed by Parent in response to such offer or
otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account
all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

6.2(f)_ and Section 6.2(g), neither the Companys board of directors nor any

otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) fail to reaffirm the

 or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
lease agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ entered into in compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ")
relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

(f) _Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision (Superior Proposal)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_,
following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the Company after the
date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __
_ 6.2_ and that the Companys board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Companys board of directors may, at any
time prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, make a Change
in Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)(ii)_, or authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly
to take any such action, if all of the following conditions are met:

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent four (4) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall state expressly (I) that it has received a
written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (II) the
material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal (including the
consideration offered therein and the identity of the Person or group making
the Acquisition Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided an
unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements and all other
documents related to the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term or
condition of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an
additional three (3) Business Day period) and (III) that, subject to clause
(ii) below, the Companys board of directors has determined to make a Change
in Recommendation and (B) prior to making such a Change in Recommendation (x)
used commercially reasonable efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to
the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such notice period, which may be on
a non-exclusive basis, to consider any adjustments proposed by Parent to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) in determining whether to
make a Change in Recommendation, the board of directors of the Company shall
take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent and any other information provided by Parent in response to such
notice; and

 

(ii) the Companys board of directors shall have determined, in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised
terms proposed by Parent, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Change in Recommendation
would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement before this Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with
its terms (including payment of any applicable Company Termination Fee and the
Parent Expenses to the extent due and payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.5(b)_).

 



46

    

(g) _Exception to Change in Recommendation (Intervening Event)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.2(e)_, upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Companys board of
directors may, at any time prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, make a Change in Recommendation if all of the following conditions
are met:

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent four (4) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall (I) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Change
in Recommendation and (II) state expressly that, subject to clause (ii)
below, the Companys board of directors has determined to make a Change in
Recommendation and (B) prior to making such a Change in Recommendation, used
commercially reasonable efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to the
extent Parent wishes to engage) during such four (4) -Business Day period to
consider any adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that the failure of the Companys board of directors to
make a Change in Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event in
accordance with clause (ii) below would no longer be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law; and

 

(ii) the Companys board of directors shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such
Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by
Parent, the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the directors duties under applicable Law.

 

(h) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _
6.2_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that (i) this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(h)_ shall
not be deemed to permit the Company or the Companys board of directors to
make a Change in Recommendation except in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.2(g)_ and (ii) any communication related to an Acquisition Proposal shall
expressly state that the Companys board of directors has not changed the
Company Recommendation.

6.3 _Information Supplied_.

 

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any
event, within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement on Schedule 14A (such proxy
statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") in preliminary form relating to the Company
Stockholders Meeting. The Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable
best efforts to provide responses to the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event within ten (10) days of the date of any SEC
comment letter) with respect to any comments received on the Proxy Statement
by the SEC and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be
mailed as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date the SEC or the
Staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

 



47

    

(b) No filing of, or amendment, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be
made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (other than any filing, amendment or supplement in
connection with a Change in Recommendation). The Company shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of all such filings, amendments or supplements to
the extent not readily publicly available. Parent shall (i) furnish all
information required by the Exchange Act or applicable Law to be included in
the Proxy Statement concerning it and its Affiliates to the Company, (ii)
provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Company in
connection with the preparation of information to be included therein and
(iii) otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments received
from the SEC. If at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company
Vote, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or
Parent which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement such that the Proxy Statement would not (A) include any
misstatement of a material fact or (B) omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then
(x) the party that makes such discovery shall promptly notify the other party
and (y) the Company shall prepare (with Parents reasonable assistance) and
file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate such
amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC (the " _Staff_ ") and of any request by the SEC or the Staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the Staff,
on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. No
response to any comments from the SEC or the Staff relating to the Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, _unless_ made pursuant to a
telephone call initiated by the SEC. The Company will cause the Proxy
Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

6.4 _Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company will, in coordination with Parent, as promptly as reasonably
practicable in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and
Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of, and
use its reasonable best efforts to convene a meeting of holders of Shares to
consider and vote upon the approval of the Merger (the "
_Company Stockholders Meeting_ "). Unless the board of directors of the
Company determines that it would be inconsistent with the directors duties
under applicable Law, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall in any event be
no less than thirty-five (35) calendar days and no later than forty (40)
calendar days after (1) the tenth calendar day after the initial preliminary
Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC if by such date the SEC
has not informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or
(2) if the SEC has, by the tenth calendar day after the initial preliminary
Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC, informed the Company
that it intends to review the Proxy Statement, the date on which the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Subject to
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the Companys board of directors shall
(i) include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) recommend
at the Company Stockholders Meeting

 



48

    

 that the holders of Shares approve the Merger and (iii) use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and solicit such approval. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if on or before the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting
is scheduled, the Company reasonably believes that (A) it will not receive
proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is
present or (B) it will not have enough Shares represented to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
the Company may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of, the Company Stockholders Meeting
in consultation with Parent. In addition, notwithstanding the first and
second sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_, the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the
Company has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is
reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated in a manner suitable
under applicable Law and reviewed by stockholders of the Company prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting. Furthermore, notwithstanding the first and
second sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_, solely in the event Parent
determines in good faith after consultation with the Company that the Company
would not reasonably be expected to receive proxies representing the Requisite
Company Vote, then upon the written request of Parent, the Company shall
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting in order to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in which case, the Company
shall, unless the board of directors of the Company has effected a Change in
Recommendation in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_, use its reasonable
best efforts during any such adjournment to solicit and obtain such proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable;
_provided_ , that Parent shall only be entitled to request such an adjournment
twice and, in any event, for no more than seven (7) days in each instance.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the approval of the Merger shall
be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by
applicable Law to be voted on by the Companys stockholders in connection with
the approval of the Merger) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by
the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The
Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current
basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results
following dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event will the record date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting be changed without the Parents prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by
applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, the Company
shall nonetheless submit the Merger to the holders of Shares for approval at
the Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is validly terminated
in accordance with _ARTICLE VIII_ prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

(c) The Company agrees that, except in the event of a Change in
Recommendation, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Company Vote.

6.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification and Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and except
as otherwise explicitly set forth in this Agreement, cooperate with each
other and use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to
use, their respective reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken)
all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or
advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws and Orders to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as expeditiously as possible, and in no event later than
the Termination Date including (i) preparing and filing all documentation to
effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as
expeditiously as possible all consents, registrations, approvals, permits,

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_, in the event that the parties receive
a request for information or documentary material pursuant to any Antitrust
Laws, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, the parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to, and to certify
compliance with, such request as promptly as practicable and advisable, and
counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any
review process in connection therewith. None of the parties, including their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, shall knowingly take, cause or permit
to be taken, or omit to take, any action which such party reasonably expects
is likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of the contemplated
transactions, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. None of the parties,
without the other partys prior written consent, shall enter into any timing
or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that
would bind or commit the parties not to consummate the contemplated
transactions (or that would otherwise prevent or prohibit the parties from
consummating the contemplated transactions). As used in this Agreement, the
term " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton
Antitrust Act of 1914, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended and all other federal, state and foreign statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees and other Laws and Orders that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or competition.

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with respect to the Antitrust Laws
and shall have joint decision making authority with respect to the appropriate
course of action with respect to obtaining the consents, approvals, permits,
waiting period expirations or authorizations of any Governmental
Entity required to consummate the Merger prior to the Termination Date. No
party hereto or its counsel shall independently participate in any substantive
call or meeting relating to the Antitrust Laws with any Governmental Entity in
respect of such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without first giving
the other party or its

 



50

    

 counsel prior notice of such call or meeting and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate. In
furtherance of the foregoing and to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
(i) each party shall notify the other, as far in advance as practicable, of
any filing or material or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of
its Subsidiaries intends to make with any Governmental Entity relating to the
matters that are the subject of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, (ii) prior to
submitting any such filing or making any such communication or inquiry, such
party shall provide the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review, and shall consider in good faith the comments of the other party in
connection with, any such filing, communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly
following the submission of such filing or making such communication
or inquiry, provide the other party with a copy of any such filing or, if in
written form, communication or inquiry and (iv) consult with the other party
in connection with any inquiry, hearing, investigation or litigation by, or
negotiations with, any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger, including
the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with any
Governmental Entity relating thereto. In exercising the foregoing cooperation
rights, the Company and Parent each shall act reasonably and as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, materials provided
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ may be reasonably redacted as necessary
to address reasonable privilege concerns.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, each of the parties, including their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity in connection with any applicable Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and to avoid the entry of, or
effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, if any Proceeding, including any
Proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such Proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Merger; _provided_ , that Parent shall bear all costs and expenses associated
with contesting or resisting any such Proceeding.

(f) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement and any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or
on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



51

    

(g) _Status_. The Company and Parent each shall keep the other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any third party or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial communications.

 

6.6 _Access; Consultation_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by
applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its
and their Representatives to, afford Parent and its Representatives, and the
Lender and its Representatives, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to the Companys and
its Subsidiaries employees, customers, suppliers, properties, assets,
commitments, Tax Returns, books, records and Contracts and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish
promptly to Parent and its Representatives all information concerning its or
any of its Subsidiaries capital stock, business and personnel as may
reasonably be requested by Parent in connection with the Merger; _provided_ ,
that no investigation pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company or
Parent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require
either the Company or Parent to (i) permit any invasive environmental
sampling or (ii) disclose any information pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.6,_ in the case of clause (ii), to the extent that in the reasonable good
faith judgment of such partys outside legal counsel, (A) any applicable Law
requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information, (B) the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a third party or (C) disclosure of any such
information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege;
_provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to clauses (A) through (C) of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_, Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to (I) obtain the required consent of
any such third party to provide such inspection or disclosure, (II)
develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address such
matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company and (III) in
the case of clauses (A) and (C) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_,
implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the
disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the
objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures,
redaction (solely to the extent necessary) or entry into a customary joint
defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the
parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such
information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege.
Any investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be conducted in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the
business of the other party. All requests for information made pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be directed to an executive officer of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, or such Person as may be designated by any
such executive officer. No investigation pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
6.6_ or information provided, made available or delivered to Parent pursuant
to this Agreement shall affect any of the representations, warranties, rights
or remedies of the parties hereunder.

 



52

    

(b) Each of Parent and the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, may
reasonably designate competitively sensitive material provided to the other
as "Outside Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions. Such material
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and
shall be subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement
between the parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.6_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. To the extent that
any of the information or material furnished pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.6_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement may include
material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal
proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree
that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it
is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such
material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the
confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this
Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in identifying any actions
or practices of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could require
remediation under applicable Law and, to the extent identified, shall
cooperate in taking commercially reasonable actions or practices and other
customary actions to reduce the risks related to such actions where the
failure to remediate would reasonably be likely to result in substantial fines
or penalties.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt written notice to one
another of (i) any change, effect, circumstance or development that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect (as applicable), (ii) any reasonably likely
failure of any condition to Parents or the Companys obligations to effect
the Merger (as applicable) and (iii) any written notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this

Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Act as soon as possible following the Effective Time.

 

6.8 _Publicity_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other prior to
issuing or making, and provide each other the opportunity to review and

national securities exchange) with respect thereto, except (i) as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any national securities exchange or the NYSE, (ii) any
consultation that would not be reasonably practicable as a result of
requirements of applicable Law, (iii) any press release or public statement
that is consistent with prior press releases issued or public statements made

6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that each employee of the Company or Altisource Asset
Management Corporation (the " _Manager_ "), or their Subsidiaries who
continues to remain employed with or, in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, becomes employed by, Parent, the
Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time occurs (the " _Continuation Period_ "), be
provided with (i) a base salary or base wage that is no less favorable than
the base salary or base wage provided to such Continuing Employee by the
Company, the Manager or their Subsidiaries, as applicable, immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity and long-term
incentive opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate
(including with respect to performance criteria and levels and timing of
payment) than the annual cash bonus opportunity and long-term incentive
opportunities (including, as applicable, the cash value of (A) equity-based
compensation and (B) any preferred stock dividends provided by the Manager)
provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company, the Manager, or their
Subsidiaries, as applicable, for the year immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, during the
Continuation Period, be provided with employee benefits (excluding change in
control payments, retention bonuses, defined benefit pension plans and post-
employment welfare benefits) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those (excluding change in control payments, retention bonuses,
defined benefit pension plans and post-employment welfare benefits) provided
by the Company, the Manager or their Subsidiaries, as applicable to such
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Additionally, Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, during the
Continuation Period be provided with severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits provided by the Company, the Manager, or
their Subsidiaries as applicable, to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time as specified in  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
Continuing Employee is entitled to severance benefits under an individual
severance, employment or similar agreement, that are greater than the
severance benefits provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the terms of such agreement and not this _Section_ __ _
6.9(a)_ shall govern.

 

(b) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to honor and assume all
obligations and pay all amounts due under the change in control severance
agreements listed in _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
(the " _Company Severance Arrangements_ ") in accordance with their respective
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent and the
Company acknowledge and agree that the consummation of the Merger shall
constitute a "Change in Control" under the Company Severance Arrangements and
each other Company Plan to which such term is relevant. 

(c) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that no pre-existing conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods shall apply to Continuing Employees under the benefit plans
provided for such employees except to the extent such condition or exclusion
was applicable to an individual Continuing Employee

 prior to the Effective Time. With respect to the plan year during which the
Continuing Employees begin participating in any Parent welfare benefit plan,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Continuing
Employee with credit for deductibles, co-insurance, co-payments and out-of-
pocket requirements paid during such plan year and prior to the Continuing
Employees participation in such Parent welfare benefit plan in satisfying
any applicable deductible, co-insurance, co-payments or out-of-pocket
requirements under any Parent welfare benefit plan in which such Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate following the Closing Date.

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, provide credit to Continuing Employees for their service
recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time for
all purposes to the same extent and for the same purposes as such service was
credited under the Company Plans; _provided_ , that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits.

 

(e) Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement the Company shall enter
into agreements in the form attached to  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(e)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter with the individuals identified therein and amend
the Companys Change in Control Severance Policy in the form attached to
_Section_ __ _ 6.9(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and neither any current or former employee,
nor any other individual associated therewith, is or shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third party beneficiary to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is
intended to, or does, (i) constitute the establishment of, or an amendment to,
any Company Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Company
or any of their Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent to
amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) give any third party any right to

by this Agreement, and each such individual or legal representative shall be
entitled to look only to the express terms of any such plan, program or
arrangement for his or her rights thereunder.

and _8.5_ , whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other

incurring such expense, except that expenses incurred in connection with the

6.11 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Insurance_. (a)
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall (to the same extent the
Surviving Company is permitted by applicable Law), and shall cause the
Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company determined as of the Effective Time (the
" _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding (including with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a
director or officer of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the
Company as a director or officer of another Person prior to the Effective
Time, in each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under the Laws of the State of Maryland, any applicable
indemnification agreement to which such Person is a party, the Company Charter
or Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such
Person (and Parent and the Surviving Company shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that the Person to whom expenses are advanced shall provide an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification). Parent shall ensure that the organizational
documents of the Surviving Company shall, for a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present
and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than
are presently set forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws. Any right
of indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner that
would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Party as provided
herein.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company

current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D
andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage no less favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , that in no
event shall the Company be required to expend for such "tail" policy an annual
premium in an amount in excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company for
any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage no less favorable
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement, or the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-
year period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the Company expend, or Parent or the
Surviving Company be required to expend for such "tail" policy an annual
premium in an amount in excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, the Surviving Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount. In all instances, such "tail"
insurance shall be procured by an insurance broker of the Parents choosing,
in consultation with the Company.

(c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.11_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall be in addition to any rights such
individual may have under the Laws of the State of Maryland, any applicable
indemnification agreement to which such Person is a party, the Company Charter
or the Company Bylaws.

(e) Neither of Parent or the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Proceeding
for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such settlement,
compromise or consent.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

6.12 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise use reasonable best efforts to act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

6.13 _Control of the Company_ __ _s or Parent_ __ _s Operations_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the other prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the

the Company, and who would otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act, to be exempt under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

the earlier of the Closing Date and the date this Agreement is terminated in

Company in its sole discretion, the effectiveness of any documents executed by
or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the

60

    

 Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates obtained by Parent and

confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose such information to
rating agencies, hedging providers, prospective lenders, participants and
investors and their respective counsel and other Representatives, in each
case who have agreed to customary confidentiality agreements which require
them to keep such information confidential in connection with the syndication
and/or marketing of the Debt Financing. Parent will promptly reimburse the
Company after written request therefor for any reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket expenses incurred or otherwise payable by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing in connection with their cooperation
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.15(a)_ (other than the Companys obligation
to deliver its regular annual and quarterly financial statements).
The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its logos in connection
with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended, or would not reasonably be expected, to harm or
disparage the Company or its reputation or goodwill. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Subject Company Properties_ " shall mean the Company
Properties that are contemplated to be subject to the Debt Financing in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter and listed on Annex II to Exhibit
B to the Debt Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date hereof) as well as
any Company Properties that are subject to any Designated Credit Facility
which Parent removes as a Designated Credit Facility in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.15(i)_, from and after the date of such removal.

(b) Parent shall have the right from time to time to (x) amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any provision or remedy under, any
Commitment Letter, (y) substitute other debt financing for all or any portion
of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative Debt Financing Sources
and/or (z) reduce the amount of the Financing under any Commitment Letter in
its reasonable discretion; _provided_ , that no such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of or remedy
under, any Commitment Letter, and/or substitution of all or any portion of the
Debt Financing, and/or reduction in the amount of Debt Financing or Equity
Financing shall be made without obtaining the Companys prior written
consent, if such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or
waiver, substitution or reduction (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) or the aggregate
amount of the Equity Financing contemplated in the Equity Commitment Letter in
each case below the amount necessary (taking into account any corresponding
increase in any other portion of the Financing and any Alternative Financing
and taking into account any Existing Credit Facility that Parent determines to
not refinance at the Closing) to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing or amends or modifies any other term of any Commitment Letter, in
each case in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or
materially delay the Closing, (B) make the timely funding of the Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing materially less
likely to occur, or (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent and Merger Sub
to enforce their rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters,
(iii) would or would reasonably be expected to (A) violate or invalidate any
of the Existing Credit Facilities that will remain in effect following the
Effective Time (including any Designated Credit Facility) or Existing Lender
Consents or (B) prevent, delay or otherwise adversely impact the release from
escrow of the Existing Lender Consents (or the

 



61

    

 satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the applicable Existing Lender
Consents) or (iv) would be reasonably expected to materially expand the scope
of, or make materially more onerous, the assistance required from the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.15(a)_ from that required in connection with the
Debt Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date hereof). An amendment or
amendment and restatement of the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof shall
not require the Companys consent. In addition to the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall not consent to the termination of the Debt Commitment Letter
prior to the first to occur of Closing and the expiration of the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms, except (x) for replacements
of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the above provisions of this
paragraph or with Alternative Financing in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.15(e)_, (y) if the amount of the Debt Financing is permitted to be reduced
to zero in accordance with the above provisions of this paragraph (in which
case, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of Parent in the first
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.15(d)_ shall not be applicable) or (z) with the
Companys prior written consent. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, Parent shall not give notice under the Debt Commitment Letter of its
election to treat any financing by one or more subsidiaries of the
Equity Investor as a Qualified Amherst Securitization or Qualified Amherst
Term Loan (in each case as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) unless
either (A) such financing has been consummated or will be consummated on or
prior to the date of such election or (B) binding commitments with respect to
such financing have been received on or prior to the date of such election,
and the reduction in the available amount of the Debt Financing resulting from
such notice under the Debt Commitment Letter shall be treated as a reduction
described in clause (z) of the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.15(b)_
and shall only be permitted if the applicable requirements of this _Section_
__ _ 6.15(b)_ are satisfied in connection therewith (including as a result
of any relevant commitment obtained as described in clause (B) of this
sentence satisfying the above requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 6.15(b)_
applicable to a replacement of the applicable portion of the Debt Commitment
Letter).

(c) Parent shall and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions and do all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Equity Financing, including by
(i) maintaining in effect the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with its
terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) satisfying on a timely
basis (or obtaining waivers with respect to) all conditions applicable to
Parent in the Equity Commitment Letter that are within its control, (iii)
enforcing its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter and (iv) consummating
the Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing, including by causing the
Equity Investor to fund the Equity Financing at the Closing.

 

(d) Parent shall and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on or prior to
the Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms and subject to
the conditions thereof, (ii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions contained therein or as otherwise may be agreed (taking into
account the limitations on amendments and modifications to the Debt
Commitment Letter set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.15(b)_), (iii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions and obligations applicable to Parent or its
Affiliates in the Debt 

 



62

    

 Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements that are within its control
(including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees
required as a condition to the Debt Financing), (iv) enforce its rights under
the Debt Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements and (v) consummate
the Debt Financing at the Closing (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
include agreeing to consummate the Debt Financing even if any flex rights are
exercised to their maximum extent). Each party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) __ satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions and obligations applicable to such party or
its Affiliates specified in the Existing Lender Consents and (y) abstain from
taking any action that would reasonably be expected to (I) __ violate or
invalidate any of the Existing Credit Facilities that will remain in effect
following the Effective Time (including any Designated Credit Facility) or
Existing Lender Consents regarding Existing Credit Facilities that will remain
in effect following the Effective Time (including any Designated Credit
Facility) or (II) prevent, delay or otherwise adversely impact the release
from escrow of the Existing Lender Consents (or the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the applicable Existing Lender Consents). Promptly
following the date hereof, the parties shall request an extension with
respect to the Existing Lender Consent identified in _Section_ __ _ 6.15(d)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter and each party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such extension on the same terms and conditions
currently applicable to such Existing Lender Consent. When used herein, "
_Debt Financing Sources_ " means the entities that have committed to provide
or arrange or otherwise have entered into agreements pursuant to the
Debt Commitment Letter or in connection with all or any part of the Debt
Financing described therein, or Alternative Financing, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or Alternative Financing Commitment, or any joinder agreements,
indentures or credit agreements entered pursuant thereto or relating thereto.

(e) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
(including any flex rights) and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter (except pursuant to an amendment or other modification permitted by 
_Section_ __ _ 6.15(b)_), Parent and Merger Sub shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, (i) alternative financing for any such portion
from alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") and (ii) a new
Debt Commitment Letter with respect to such Alternative Financing that
provides for financing (A) not containing any terms or conditions that would
have been prohibited pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.15(b)_ if the same had
been effected through an amendment or modification of the Debt Commitment
Letter, (B) in an amount that is sufficient, when added to any portion of the
Debt Financing that is available and the Equity Financing, to pay in cash all
amounts required to be paid by Parent in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and (C) that would not reasonably be
expected to (I) violate or invalidate any of the Existing Credit Facilities
that will remain in effect following the Effective Time (including any
Designated Credit Facility) or Existing Lender Consents or (II) prevent, delay
or otherwise adversely impact the release from escrow of the Existing Lender
Consents (or the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the applicable
Existing Lender Consents) (the " _Alternative Financing Commitments_ ").
Parent shall promptly provide the Company with true, correct and complete
copies of any new Debt Commitment Letter and any fee letter in connection
therewith (which fee letter may be subject to Customary Redactions). If any
new debt commitment letter is obtained pursuant to the above provisions of
this paragraph or in connection with a replacement or substitution permitted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.15(b)_, (x) any reference in this Agreement to
the "Commitment Letters" or "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be

 



63

    

 deemed to include such new debt commitment letter to the extent still then
in effect (together with any accompanying fee letter), (y) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to
the foregoing and (z) any reference in this Agreement to the "Lender" or "Debt
Financing Sources" shall be deemed to include the lender parties to such new
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent still then in effect.

(f) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of all material activity concerning the Financing (including
(x) the status of its efforts to obtain the Financing or any Alternative
Financing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.15(e)_ and (y) its determination as
to which Existing Credit Facilities will remain in effect after the Effective
Time) and promptly provide the Company with copies of all executed amendments,
modifications or replacements of the Debt Commitment Letter (it being
understood that any amendments, modifications or replacements shall only be as
permitted herein) or definitive agreements related to the Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly notify the
Company (A) of any material breach or default by any party to the Commitment
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Parent
becomes aware, (B) of the receipt by Parent of any written notice or
communication from either the Equity Investor or a Debt Financing Source with
respect to any actual or asserted breach or default, or any termination or
repudiation, in each case by any party to a Commitment Letter or
any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of any
Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements, (C) of any event or
development that would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
effect on the ability of Parent to obtain the Financing on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letter in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(D) if for any reason Parent at any time has determined in good faith that it
will not be able to obtain all or any material portion of the Financing on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Commitment
Letters or any definitive agreements related to any of the Financing.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) it shall not be a condition to the obligations
of Parent to pay all of its payment obligations hereunder and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of its other obligations
under this Agreement that Parent or Merger Sub continue to have access to the
financing contemplated by the Financings or other materials delivered to the
Company evidencing Parent and Merger Subs possession of sufficient funds for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or prior to the date
hereof ( _i.e._ , Parents and Merger Subs obligations are not conditioned
upon the availability of financing) and (ii) neither the obtaining nor the
availability or funding of any Debt Financing shall constitute a condition to
Parents or Merger Subs obligation to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as required hereby.

 

(h) Parent and Merger Sub shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred in connection with any and all of the matters
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 6.15(a)_ (other than arising from gross
negligence, fraud or intentional misrepresentation on the part of the Company
or its Subsidiaries), whether or not the Merger is consummated or this
Agreement is terminated. 

 



64

    

(i) No later than 35 days prior to the Closing Date (or such later date as the
Company may agree in its sole discretion), upon written notice to the
Company, Parent shall be permitted to remove the designation of any Existing
Credit Facility as Designated Credit Facility (subject to the satisfaction of
the requirements of  _Section_ __ _ 6.15(b)_ as if such written notice were
an amendment to the Debt Commitment Letter). Following the delivery of any
such notice with respect to any Designated Credit Facility, such Designated
Credit Facility shall irrevocably cease to be a "Designated Credit Facility"
and the Existing Lender Consent with respect to such Designated Credit
Facility shall cease to be an "Existing Lender Consent", in each case, for all
purposes under this Agreement.

6.16 _[Reserved]_.

 

6.17 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall (a) notify Parent in writing
promptly after learning of any Proceeding by any stockholder against the

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) notify Parent of ongoing
material developments in any such Proceeding and (c) consult in good faith

applicable Law, reasonably acceptable to both parties by which the parties
will confer on a regular and continued basis (subject to reasonable advance
written notice of any such meeting being provided to each party) regarding the
general status of the ongoing operations and administration of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and integration planning matters and communicate
and consult with, and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with, each other and the specific persons to be identified by each

employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are anticipated to become
Continuing Employees. The scheduling of all such training shall be subject to
prior approval of the Company, which approval shall not unreasonably be

of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company shall reasonably cooperate
with Parent and its Representatives to assist and facilitate such training.

6.21 _Existing Credit Facilities_.

 

(a) Without limiting any of the Companys obligations under _Section_ __ _

delivered by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a lender or agent in
connection with the Existing Credit Facilities or the Existing Lender

pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries arising from the
performance of actions requested by Parent in writing under this _Section_ __
_ 6.22_. Notwithstanding the first proviso in the first sentence of this

fails to pay promptly any amount that may become due pursuant to _Section_ __

liability for any losses suffered under, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the termination
hereof and the abandonment of the Merger), whether at law, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, regardless of whether any such termination or
abandonment was as the result of a Willful Breach by any Parent Related
Party, and neither the Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring
or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against Parent or any other
Parent Related Party arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Merger or any matters forming the basis for such termination. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, Parent and Merger Sub

Agreement.

 



73

    

(g) The parties agree that, except in the event of a Willful Breach by the
Company of  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the payment of the Company Termination Fee
and Parent Expenses and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(e)_, shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub under or related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the failure
thereof to be consummated) in the event any such payment becomes due and
payable and, upon the actual receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee

contemplated hereby (including the termination hereof and the abandonment of
the Merger), whether at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise (in each case,
other than as a result of a Willful Breach by the Company of _Section_ __ _
6.2_), and neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company
or any other Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement, the Merger
or any matters forming the basis for such termination. For the avoidance of
doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and the payment of the Company Termination Fee and
Parent Expenses (in each case in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement), under no circumstances shall Parent and Merger Sub be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and any money
damages, including all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee and
Parent Expenses.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party to this
Agreement on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates hereby

Sources and their respective Affiliates respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, direct or indirect shareholders
or equityholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees,
controlling persons, agents, advisors and other representatives, and their
successors and permitted assigns.

failure to act, with the intent of causing a material breach of this
Agreement, which act or failure to act constitutes in and of itself a material
breach of this Agreement.

8.6 _Payment into Escrow_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
the Company determines in good faith that there exists a material risk that
any amounts due to the Company under _Section_ __ _ 8.5(c)_ would be treated
upon the payment of such amounts to the Company as gross income for purposes
of Section 856 of the Code (other than as described in Section 856(c)(3) of
the Code) (" _Nonqualifying Income_ "), the amount paid to the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(c)_ in the tax year during which such amount
would otherwise be paid shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be paid
to the Company in such tax year without causing the Company to fail to meet
the requirements imposed on REITs pursuant to Sections 856 through and
including 860 of the Code (the " _REIT Requirements_ ") for any tax year,
determined as if the payment of such amount were Nonqualifying Income as
determined by the Company in good faith.

(b) If the amount that Parent would otherwise be obligated to pay to the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(c)_ is greater than the amount payable
for the tax year during which any such amount would otherwise be paid pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.6(a)_ (the positive excess of such amount, the "
_Company Excess Amount_ "), then:

(i) Parent shall place the Company Excess Amount into an escrow account (the
" _Company Escrow Account_ ") using an escrow agent and agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company and shall not release any portion thereof to the
Company, and the Company shall not be entitled to any such amount, unless and
until the Company delivers to Parent, at the sole option of the Company, (A)
an opinion (a " _Company Excess Amount Tax Opinion_ ") of the Companys
tax counsel to the effect that such amount, if and to the extent paid, would
not constitute Nonqualifying Income or (B) a private letter ruling issued by
the IRS to the Company indicating that the receipt of any Company Excess
Amount hereunder will not cause the Company to fail to satisfy the REIT
Requirements (a " _Company REIT Qualification Ruling_ "). The escrow agreement
shall also provide that (x) the amount in the Company Escrow Account shall be
treated as the property of Parent, unless it is released from such Company
Escrow Account to the Company, (y) all income earned upon the amount in the
Company Escrow Account shall be treated as income of Parent and reported, as
and to the extent required by applicable Law, by the escrow agent to the IRS,
or any other taxing authority, as income earned by Parent whether or not said
income has been distributed during such tax year, and (z) the amount in the
Company Escrow Account shall be invested in Permitted Investments only, as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion;

(ii) any amount held in the Company Escrow Account pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.6_ for five (5) years shall be released from such escrow to
be used as determined by Parent in its sole and absolute discretion, and the
Company shall have no rights in such amounts thereafter; and

 

(iii) the Company shall bear all costs and expenses with respect to the
Company Escrow Account.

 



75

good faith with the Company (including amending this _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ at
the reasonable request of the Company) in order to (i) maximize the portion of
the payments that may be made to the Company hereunder without causing the
Company to fail to meet the REIT Requirements, (ii) improve the Companys
chances of securing a favorable Company REIT Qualification Ruling, or (iii)
assist the Company in obtaining a favorable Company Excess Amount Tax Opinion.
Such cooperation shall include, for example, agreeing to make payments
hereunder to a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of the Company or an affiliate or
designee of the Company.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
Parent determines in good faith that there exists a material risk that any
amounts due to Parent under _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ would be treated upon the
payment of such amounts to Parent as Nonqualifying Income, the amount paid to
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ in the tax year during which such
amount would otherwise be paid shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be
paid to Parent in such tax year without causing Parent (or any direct or
indirect owner thereof) to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any tax
year, determined as if the payment of such amount were Nonqualifying Income as
determined by Parent in good faith.

(e) If the amount that Company would otherwise be obligated to pay to Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ is greater than the amount payable for the
tax year during which any such amount would otherwise be paid pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.6(d)_ (the positive excess of such amount, the " _Parent
Excess Amount_ "), then:

(i) the Company shall place the Parent Excess Amount into an escrow account
(the " _Parent Escrow Account_ ") using an escrow agent and agreement
reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall not release any portion thereof to
Parent, and Parent shall not be entitled to any such amount, unless and until
Parent delivers to the Company, at the sole option of Parent, (A) an opinion
(an " _Parent Excess Amount Tax Opinion_ ") of Parents tax counsel to the
effect that such amount, if and to the extent paid, would not constitute
Nonqualifying Income or (B) a private letter ruling issued by the IRS to
Parent (or any direct or indirect owner thereof) indicating that the receipt
of any Parent Excess Amount hereunder will not cause Parent (or any direct or
indirect owner thereof) to fail to satisfy the REIT Requirements (a " _Parent
REIT Qualification Ruling_ "). The escrow agreement shall also provide that
(x) the amount in the Parent Escrow Account shall be treated as the property
of the Company, unless it is released from such Parent Escrow Account to
Parent, (y) all income earned upon the amount in the Parent Escrow Account
shall be treated as income of the Company and reported, as and to the extent
required by applicable Law, by the escrow agent to the IRS, or any other
taxing authority, as income earned by the Company whether or not said income
has been distributed during such tax year, and (z) the amount in the Parent
Escrow Account shall be invested in Permitted Investments only, as determined
by the Company in its sole discretion;

 

(ii) any amount held in the Parent Escrow Account pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 8.6_ for five (5) years shall be released from such escrow to be used
as determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, and Parent
shall have no rights in such amounts thereafter; and

 

(iii) Parent shall bear all costs and expenses with respect to the Parent
Escrow Account.

 



76

    

(f) The Company shall cooperate, at no unreimbursed cost or expense to the
Company, in good faith with Parent (including amending this _Section_ __ _
8.6_ at the reasonable request of Parent) in order to (i) maximize the portion
of the payments that may be made to Parent hereunder without causing Parent
(or any direct or indirect owner thereof) to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements, (ii) improve Parents (or any direct or indirect owner thereof)
chances of securing a favorable Parent REIT Qualification Ruling, or (iii)
assist Parent (or any direct or indirect owner thereof) in obtaining a
favorable Parent Excess Amount Tax Opinion. Such cooperation shall include,
for example, agreeing to make payments hereunder to a Taxable REIT Subsidiary
of Parent (or any direct or indirect owner thereof) or an affiliate or
designee of Parent.

any Debt Financing Related Party arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (i) any claim that it is not

otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Proceeding in any such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C)

9.7 _Entire Agreement_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto) and the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 31, 2019, between the
Company and an affiliate of Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the
Exclusivity Agreement, dated November 26, 2019 (as amended), between the
Company and an affiliate of Parent and the letter agreement regarding
confidentiality, dated December 6, 2019, between the Company and an affiliate
of Parent, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and
oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

(b) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
be deemed amended hereby such that (i) the Standstill Termination Date (as
defined in Section 8 of the Confidentiality Agreement) shall be the date of
this Agreement and (ii) the term "Representatives" (as defined in Section
1(b) of the Confidentiality Agreement) shall include (x) any direct or
indirect debt or equity financing source of Parent or Merger Sub (without the
Company having to consent thereto) and (y) any Person with which Parent
or any of its Affiliates consider discussing a potential sale or other
disposition of any assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries (any such sale or
disposition to be conditioned on the occurrence of Effective Time). The
Company shall take any additional action required to give effect to the
foregoing amendments effective as of the date hereof, and all affiliates of
Parent shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 9.7(b)_.

 

9.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, other than (a) as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.11_
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), and the penultimate
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.22_ (Certain Tax Matters), (b) the right of the
Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing,
(c) the right of the holders of awards under the Company Stock Plans to
receive such consideration as provided for in  _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ after the
Closing, (d) _ Section_ __ _ 8.5(f)_ (Liability of Parent Related Parties),
_Section_ __ _ 8.5(g)_ (Liability of Company Related Parties),  _Section_ __
_ 9.2_ (Modification or Amendment), _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ (Governing Law and
Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial) and _Section_ __ _ 9.7(b)_ (Entire Agreement)
which, to the extent applicable to the Company Related Parties, Parent
Related Parties and/or the Lender, are intended to benefit and be enforceable
by the Company Related Parties, Parent Related Parties and/or the Lender (as
applicable), (e) the right of the Company on behalf of the Company
stockholders to pursue damages in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ and (f)
the rights of the Debt Financing Related Parties as provided in _Sections_ __
_ 8.5(h)_, _9.2_ , _9.5(a)_ ,  _9.5(c)_ , _9.5(d)_ , this _Section_ __ _
9.8_ and _Sections 9.12_ and _9.13(b)_. The third-party beneficiary rights
referenced in clause (e) of the preceding sentence may be exercised only by
the Company (on behalf of the Company stockholders as their agent) through
actions expressly approved by the board of directors of the Company, and no
Company stockholder, whether purporting to act in its capacity as a
stockholder or purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on
behalf of the Company, shall have any right or ability to exercise or cause
the exercise of any such right.

 

9.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 



81

    

9.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision negotiated in good faith by the parties hereto shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not, subject to clause (a) above, be affected
by such invalidity or unenforceability, except as a result of such
substitution, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

 

9.11 _Interpretation_.

(a) The table of contents and the Article, Section and paragraph headings or
captions herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part
of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of
the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a
Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The word "or" when used in this Agreement is not exclusive. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if".
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

 



82

    

9.12 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law
or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the other parties
hereto, and any assignment without such consent shall be null and void;
_provided_ , that upon and following the Effective Time (i) Parent and Merger
Sub may collaterally assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder
to any Debt Financing Sources and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub may assign any or
all of its rights or obligations hereunder to any Affiliate; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, in each case, (A) no assignment shall relieve the assigning
party of any of its obligations hereunder and (B) no such assignment shall
affect the obligations of any Person who has committed to provide Equity
Financing under the applicable Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantor
under the Limited Guarantee.

9.13 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the
event that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of
the parties to this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by the other party, and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, and including to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to
make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including _ARTICLE I_ and
_ARTICLE IV_ ) by a decree of specific performance, in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_ of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving
actual harm or damages or posting a bond or other security therefor, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity, and each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the
parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants
required to be performed by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement
(including _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, and including to cause Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make the payments contemplated
by this Agreement, including  _ARTICLE I_ and _ARTICLE IV_ ) in addition to
any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity,
including the Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE
VIII_ and seek money damages in accordance therewith. Parent shall cause
Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.13(a)_ and subject to the last sentence
of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.13(b)_, it is explicitly agreed that the Company
shall be entitled to specific performance of Parents obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letter to fund the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and consummate the Closing only in the event that (i) all conditions
in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied or
waived (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing) and Parent or Merger Sub fails to consummate the Merger on the date
the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, (ii) the
financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter (or, if Alternative
Financing is being used in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.15(e)_, pursuant
to the Alternative Financing Commitments with respect thereto) has been 

 



83

    

 funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that it
is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing if specific performance
is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company or any of its successors or
permitted assigns be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically the
remedy of specific performance of the Debt Commitment Letter against any Debt
Financing Source.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries right to seek specific performance
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit
the Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE VIII_
and/or seek payment of the Parent Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, while the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee, in no event
shall the Company or any of its Affiliates be entitled to both a grant of
specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee.
