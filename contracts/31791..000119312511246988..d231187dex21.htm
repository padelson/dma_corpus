\- v -  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of September 7,
2011, is among PerkinElmer, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Parent"),
PerkinElmer Hopkinton Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Parent (the "Merger Sub"), and Caliper Life Sciences, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, the Merger Sub and
the Company have determined that it would be advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders for the Parent to acquire the
Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger
(the "Merger") of the Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), as a result of which the Company shall become a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Parent; and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to the Parents willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the stockholders of the Company listed on _Schedule A_ have entered
into a voting agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "Company Stockholder Agreement"),
pursuant to which such stockholders have, among other things, agreed to vote
all of the shares of voting capital stock of the Company that such
stockholders own in favor of the Company Voting Proposal (as defined below);

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, the Merger Sub shall merge
with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined below). At the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations
of the Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

 



\- 1 -  1.2 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
9:00 a.m., eastern time, on the second business day after the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VII (other than those that by their terms cannot be satisfied
until the time of the Closing but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such
conditions), at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60
State Street, Boston, MA 02109, or at such other time, date or place agreed
to in writing by the Parent and the Company; _provided_ that if all the
conditions set forth in Article VII shall not have been satisfied or (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) waived on such second business day, then
the Closing shall take place on the first business day on which all such
conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable
law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Closing Date."

1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, a
certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the
"Certificate of Merger") shall be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by
the parties in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary
of State"). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such
subsequent time or date as the Parent and the Company shall agree and specify
in the Certificate of Merger. The time at which the Merger becomes effective
is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time."

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended at the Effective Time in its
entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit B_ until thereafter amended as
provided under the DGCL. The By-laws of the Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided under the DGCL.

1.6 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of the Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their successors are elected and qualified. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause each member of the Company Board to
execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her resignation as a director
of the Company (and, to the extent requested by the Parent, each of the
Companys Subsidiaries) effective upon the Effective Time.

 



\- 2 -  ARTICLE II

_CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_

2.1 _Effect of Merger of Capital Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or
capital stock of the Merger Sub:

(i) each share of the Merger Subs capital stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the same class of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; 

(ii) each share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company
("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is owned by the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company or
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, the Merger Sub
or the Company, including all shares of Company Common Stock held by the
Company as treasury stock, shall automatically be cancelled, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto; and

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to clause (ii) above and any Dissenting Shares (as defined
in Section 2.1(b) hereof)) shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished
and be converted into and become the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(as defined in this Section 2.1(a)). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") and each holder
of any such shares of Company Common Stock held in book entry form immediately
prior to the Effective Time ("Book Entry Shares") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(iii) upon surrender of such
Certificate or such Book Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding rights in accordance with
Section 2.2(g).

As used in this Agreement, the "Merger Consideration" shall mean $10.50.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the
"Dissenting Shares") of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)(iii), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the

 



\- 3 -   provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under Section 262 shall cease
and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)(iii), without interest. The
Company shall give the Parent and the Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands
for payment, or notices of intent to demand payment, received by the Company
with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, and the Parent and the Merger
Sub shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent and
the Merger Sub, make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(c) In connection with the Merger, each outstanding option to purchase Company
Common Stock ("Company Stock Options") and each restricted stock unit ("RSU")
shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 6.11.

(d) In connection with the Merger, each outstanding warrant to purchase
Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Warrants") shall be treated in the manner
set forth in Section 6.12.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the "Paying Agent") for the payment after the Effective Time of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares. From time
to time after the Effective Time, the Parent shall provide, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to the Paying Agent, on a timely basis as
and when needed, cash necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii) upon surrender of Certificates and Book Entry
Shares (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or of
Book Entry Shares, within five business days of the Effective Time, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to a Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificate to the Paying Agent and, in the case of Book Entry Shares,
delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title shall pass only upon
adherence to the procedures set

 



\- 4 -   forth in the letter of transmittal, and which letter of transmittal shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as the Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates and Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Surrender of any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the
Paying Agents customary procedures with respect to securities represented by
book entry. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by the Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and properly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or
Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount
of cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii), and the Certificate or Book Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered
is or are registered if, in the case of a Certificate, such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, or, in the
case of Book Entry Shares, the person in whose name such Book Entry Shares are
registered shall have delivered to the Paying Agent instruments of
transfer in such form as the Paying Agent may require in accordance with its
customary procedures for the transfer for securities represented by book
entry, and, in each case, the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares or
establish to the satisfaction of the Parent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate and all Book Entry Shares shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii). No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book
Entry Shares.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares
in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of the
capital stock of the Company (the "Company Capital Stock") formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Shares. Upon the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

 



\- 5 -  (d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book Entry
Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the
Paying Agent to the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or
Book Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration,
but shall have no greater rights against the Parent than may be accorded to
general unsecured creditors of the Parent under applicable law.

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate or any Book Entry Shares have not been surrendered prior to two
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry
Shares would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity (as defined in Section 3.4)), any such cash in respect of such
Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Investments of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund in (i) direct obligations of the United States of
America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and
interest, (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from
either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The
McGraw Hill Companies, or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a
combination of the foregoing, or a combination thereof, as directed by and for
the benefit of the Parent; provided, however, that no gain or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and the Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Payment Fund to include at all times cash
necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(iii) upon surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be the
property of the Parent.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. The Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as any of them
reasonably determines are required to be deducted and withheld by any of them
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.

2.3 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger Consideration
required pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii), in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof with such assurances as the Parent or Paying Agent, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger
Consideration, may require of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

 



\- 6 -  ARTICLE III

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

The Company represents and warrants to the Parent and the Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article III are true and correct, except as set
forth herein or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to the
Parent on or before the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"). The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs
corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this
Article III and the disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify (1) the
corresponding paragraphs in this Article III and (2) the other paragraphs in
this Article III only to the extent that it is readily apparent from a reading
of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such
other paragraphs.

3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted by the
Company as of the date of this Agreement, and is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction listed
in Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which
jurisdictions constitute the only jurisdictions in which the character of the
properties it owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so organized,
qualified or in good standing that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Material
Adverse Effect" means any change, event, circumstance, development or effect
(each, a "Change") that, individually or in the aggregate with all other
Changes occurring or existing prior to the determination of a Company Material
Adverse Effect, has a material adverse effect on (i) the business, assets,
liabilities, capitalization, financial condition, or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of the
Company to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ that, solely for purposes of clause (i) above, none
of the following, and no effect arising out of or resulting from the
following, in each case to the extent arising after the date of this
Agreement, shall constitute (in and of itself) a Company Material Adverse
Effect or be taken into account in determining whether a "Company Material
Adverse Effect" has occurred or may, would or could occur (except, in the
cases of clauses (x) and (y)(A), (C) and (D), where the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are disproportionately affected relative to
other comparable Persons operating in the industries in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries operate): (x) any Change generally affecting (A) the
principal industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries primarily
operate or (B) the economy, credit or financial or capital markets 

 



\- 7 -   in the United States or elsewhere in the world, including changes in
interest or currency exchange rates, or (y) any Change arising out of,
resulting from or attributable to (A) changes or prospective changes in Law,
in applicable regulations of any Governmental Entity, in generally accepted
accounting principles or in accounting standards, or any changes or
prospective changes in the interpretation or enforcement of any of
the foregoing, (B) the announcement or pendency of this Agreement and/or the
Merger, (C) acts of war (whether or not declared), sabotage or terrorism, or
any escalation or worsening of any such acts of war (whether or not declared),
sabotage or terrorism, (D) pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados or
other natural disasters, (E) any decline in the market price, or change in
trading volume, of any capital stock of the Company (it being understood, in
each case, that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such
decline or change may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a
Company Material Adverse Effect), or (F) the failure of the Company to meet
internal or analysts expectations or projections for any period ending on or
after the date of this Agreement, in and of itself (it being understood that
the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such failure may be
deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there
has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse
Effect). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the terms
"material", "materially" or "materiality" as used in this Agreement with an
initial lower case "m" shall have their respective customary and ordinary
meanings, without regard to the meanings ascribed to Company Material Adverse
Effect in the prior sentence of this paragraph. The Company has delivered to
the Parent complete and accurate copies of the Certificate of Incorporation
and By-laws of the Company.

Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other
equity securities or interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights and all such shares (other than directors qualifying shares in the
case of non-U.S. Subsidiaries, all of which the Company has the power to cause

under, require the payment of a penalty under or result in the imposition of

holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock on the record date for the meeting of the Companys stockholders (the
"Company Meeting") to consider the Company Voting Proposal (the "Required
Company Stockholder Vote") is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of the Companys capital stock or other securities necessary for the
adoption of this Agreement and for the consummation by the Company of the

in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws and the
regulations thereunder and in accordance with its terms and each of the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates has in all
material respects met its obligations with respect to such Company Employee
Plan and has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved such
contributions on the Company Balance Sheet). The Company, each Subsidiary of
the Company, each ERISA Affiliate and each Company Employee Plan are in
compliance with the currently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and
the regulations thereunder (including Section 4980 B of the Code, Subtitle K,
Chapter 100 of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 and Section 701 et seq.
of ERISA), except for any instances of non-compliance that, individually or in

in, any material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All
filings and reports as to each Company Employee Plan required to have been
submitted to the IRS or to the United States Department of Labor have been
timely submitted. With respect to the Company Employee Plans, no event
has occurred, and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in
connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject
to any material liability under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.

Schedule, no such Employee Benefit Plan has been amended or operated since the
date of its most recent determination or opinion letter or application

adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its cost. Each
Company Employee Plan which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or
Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for compliance with, and
satisfies the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the

Plan which was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or
(ii) ever been obligated to contribute to a "Multiemployer Plan" (as defined
in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Company Employee Plan is funded by,

holds as an asset securities issued by the Company, any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates.

Code for benefits accrued through the date of termination or amendment and
reasonable administrative expenses related thereto) and no Company Employee
Plan, plan documentation or agreement, summary plan description or other
written communication distributed generally to employees by its terms
prohibits the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating
any such Company Employee Plan. Except as provided in information previously
made available to the Parent, the investment vehicles used to fund the Company
Employee Plans may be changed at any time without incurring a sales charge,
surrender fee or other similar expense.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the nature of the Merger or any of the

or (iii) agreement or plan binding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted
stock plan, stock purchase plan or severance benefit plan, any of the benefits

accelerated, by the occurrence of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which
shall be calculated on the basis of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has made available to
the Parent its calculation of any excise tax due under Section 4999 of the
Code as a result of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement for which the Company or the Parent may directly or
indirectly become liable and the amount of deductions that may be disallowed

Subsidiaries, each Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Code Section 409A(d)(1)) has been operated
since January 1, 2005 in compliance (taking into account any period for which
the applicable standard was "good faith" compliance) with Code Section 409A
and IRS Notice 2005-1 and has been in documentary compliance since January 1,
2009, no event has occurred that would be treated by Code Section 409A(b) as a

equity unit option granted under any Company Employee Plan had an exercise
price that was or may have been less than the fair market value of the
underlying stock or equity units (as the case may be) as of the date such
option was granted, or has any feature for the deferral of compensation other

disposition of such option. The Companys past and current stock option grant
practices (i) complied with all applicable Company Stock Plans, stock exchange
rules and applicable laws, (ii) have been fairly presented in accordance with
GAAP in the Companys financial statements, and (iii) are not and have not

fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made in the Proxy Statement not false or misleading; or omit to

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

6.1 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 6.1, the Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or
other advisors, agents or representatives (such directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, other advisors, agents
and representatives, collectively, "Representatives") to directly or
indirectly:

 

(i) solicit, initiate, propose, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, including (A)
approving any transaction under Section 203 of the DGCL, (B) approving any
person becoming an "interested stockholder" under Section 203 of the DGCL and
(C) amending or granting any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock; or

 

(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any communications,
discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any person any information
or data with respect to, assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any
person with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any
Acquisition Proposal.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval (the "Specified Time"), the Company may, to the extent failure to do
so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board
under applicable law, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Company
Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a bona
fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made or received after the
date of this Agreement that the Company Board reasonably determines in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel and the Financial Advisor or
another nationally recognized independent financial advisor is, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, in each case that did not
result from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.1, and not earlier than
three business days after providing the notice contemplated by 6.1(c), (x)
furnish information or data with respect to the Company to the person making
such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other party than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with such person and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1(a) by any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is
purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 6.1(a) by the Company.

 



\- 45 -  (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) except as set forth in this Section 6.1(b), withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to the Parent or the Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the
Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger;

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement (an "Acquisition Agreement")
constituting or relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in 6.1(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in 6.1(a)); or

(iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, _provided_ the Company shall not have breached
its obligations under Section 6.1(a), the Company Board may withdraw or modify
the recommendation by the Company Board or any committee thereof of this
Agreement or the Merger in circumstances where the Company Board
has determined that a Superior Proposal is outstanding, if (A) (1) the
Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel and the Financial Advisor or another nationally recognized
independent financial advisor, that to do otherwise would be inconsistent
with the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board under applicable law, but
only at a time that is prior to the Specified Time and is after the fifth
business day following the Parents receipt of written notice (an "Adverse
Recommendation Notice") advising the Parent that the Company Board desires to
withdraw or modify the recommendation (and the manner and timing in which it
intends to do so) (such five business day period, the "Notice Period"), and
(2) the Company provides the Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and negotiates in
good faith with the Parent with respect thereto during the Notice Period, in
each case as would enable the Company Board or committee thereof to proceed
with its recommendation in favor of this Agreement or the Merger, and (B) (1)
such withdrawal is due to the existence of a Superior Proposal, and the
Company has complied with the requirements of Section 6.1(c), including
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and
identifying the person making such Superior Proposal, and (2) the
Parent shall not have, at or prior to the end of the Notice Period, made an
offer or proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors) to be at least as
favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view as
such Superior Proposal. Any material changes to the financial terms or any
material change to other material terms of such Superior Proposal occurring
prior to the Company Boards effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) shall require the Company to provide to
the Parent a new Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new Notice Period and to
comply with 

 



\- 46 -   the requirements of this Section 6.1(b) with respect to each such Adverse
Recommendation Notice. In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time prior to the Specified Time, the Company Board may in response to a
material development or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the
date hereof that was neither known to the Company Board nor reasonably
foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof (and not relating to any
Acquisition Proposal) (such material development or change in circumstances,
an "Intervening Event"), withdraw or modify its recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger if the Company Board has concluded in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel and the Financial Advisor or
another nationally recognized independent financial advisor, that, in light of
such Intervening Event, failure to withdraw or modify its recommendation of
this Agreement or the Merger would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law; _provided_ that, the Company Board shall not
be entitled to take such action pursuant to this sentence unless the Company
has (x) provided to the Parent at least five business days prior written
notice (unless the Intervening Event arises fewer than five business days
prior to the Specified Time, in which case such period shall the number of
business days prior to the Specified Time) advising the Parent that the
Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor
in reasonable detail and (y) during such five business day period, if
requested by the Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with the Parent
to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for taking
such action as a result of the Intervening Event. Any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any
other approval of the Company Board, including in any respect that would have
the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover
statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger. 

(c) The Company shall promptly advise the Parent orally, with written
confirmation to follow within 24 hours, of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry with respect to or that may reasonably be expected to lead to
any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person making any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep the Parent fully
informed, on a current basis, of the status and material details (including
any material change to the terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry,
(ii) provide to the Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence
and other written material sent or provided to the Company or its
Representatives, including those provided by electronic mail, from any third
party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by the
Company or its Representatives to any third party in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal and (iii) if the Parent shall make a counterproposal,
consider in good faith the terms of such counterproposal. Contemporaneously
with providing any information to a third party in connection with any such
Superior Proposal or inquiry, the Company shall furnish a copy of such
information to the Parent.

 



\- 47 -  (d) Nothing contained in Section 6.1 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a
tender offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
or from making any required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with
outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event
shall the Company Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to
take, any action prohibited by Section 6.1(b).

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, cease immediately all communications, discussions and
negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to have all copies of all nonpublic data and
information it or its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives have
distributed on or prior to the date of this Agreement to other potential
purchasers returned to the Company as soon as possible.

(f) The Company agrees to enforce or cause to be enforced each
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party at the request of the Parent, including
by seeking specific performance of, or injunctive or other equitable relief
under, any such agreements.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

"Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any inquiry, proposal or offer for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, sale of substantial assets, tender offer,
recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination however
effected involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any proposal
for the issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of over 15% of its
equity securities or (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner,
directly or indirectly, over 15% of the equity securities or consolidated
total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

"Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide written proposal made by
a third party which, if consummated, would result in such third party owning
all the equity securities or assets of the Company, pursuant to a tender or
exchange offer, a merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business
combination however to be effected or a sale of its assets, (i) on terms which
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
consultation with a nationally recognized independent financial advisor),
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any proposal by the Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement) and (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such proposal, including the nature of any financing
arrangements made or to be undertaken by the third party as part of such
proposal.

 



\- 48 -  6.2 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the

the Proxy Statement. The Company shall respond to any comments of the SEC or
its staff as promptly as practicable and shall cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders on or prior to the third business day after the
resolution of any such comments or, if the SEC does not deliver any such
comments on or before the tenth calendar day following the filing of the
Proxy Statement, on or prior to the third business day following such tenth
calendar day. The Company shall notify the Parent promptly upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and
of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply the Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.
The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it
is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under
this Section 6.2 to comply in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide the Parent an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall
include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the
Parent and (iii) shall not file or mail such document, or respond to the SEC,
prior to receiving the approval of the Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Whenever any event occurs which
is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly
inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or
its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of
the Company, such amendment or supplement.

afford to the Parent and its Representatives complete access, at all
reasonable times and upon reasonable prior notice, during the period prior
to the Effective Time, to all of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries
properties, books, records, contracts, commitments and personnel and shall
furnish the Parent all financial, operating and other data and information as
the Parent may reasonably request. Unless otherwise required by law, the
Parent will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company shall, within two business days of any request
therefor, provide to the Parent the information described in Rule
14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act and any information to which a holder
of Company Common Stock would be entitled under Section 220

 



\- 49 -   of the DGCL (assuming such holder met the requirements of such section). The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to secure for the Company access to
and copies of the workpapers of its independent public accountants. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained in the Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties to consummate the Merger.

6.5 _Stockholders Meeting_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall take all
actions in accordance with applicable law, its Certificate of Incorporation
and By-laws and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market to promptly and duly fix
a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as
practicable, and not later than the 30th calendar day immediately following
the date of the mailing of the Proxy Statement absent any legal restraint
that prevents such action, the Company Meeting for the purpose of considering
and voting upon the Company Voting Proposal. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject to Section 6.1, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company or any other person of any Acquisition Proposal. Subject to Section
6.1, (a) the Company Board shall recommend adoption of the Company Voting
Proposal by the stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in
the Proxy Statement and (b) the Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw or
modify, or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to the Parent, the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Companys stockholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. Subject
to Section 6.1, the Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and
lawful to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Company Voting
Proposal and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable
to secure the vote of the stockholders of the Company required by the rules
of The Nasdaq Stock Market or the DGCL to obtain such approvals.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company, after consultation with the Parent, may or, if requested by the
Parent, shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to the extent necessary
to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the
Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement),
there are insufficient affirmative votes to duly authorize the Company Voting
Proposal.

 

6.6 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.6(b), the Company and the
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable, (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental
Entity or any other third party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by the
Company or the Parent or any of their 

 



\- 50 -   Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) as promptly as practicable (and, in the case of the Pre-Merger
Notification and Report Form filed pursuant to the HSR Act, in any event
within ten business days), make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any
other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger
required under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other
applicable federal or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and any related
governmental request thereunder, and (C) any other applicable law and (iv)
execute or deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement. The Company and the Parent shall cooperate with
each other in connection with the making of all such filings and shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to the rules and regulations of any applicable law (including all information
required to be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Parent and the Company agree that nothing contained in this
Section 6.6(a) shall modify or affect their respective rights and
responsibilities under Section 6.6(b).

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Parent and the Company agree, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or
approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law or, regulation or decree
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively "Antitrust Laws"), and
to respond to any government requests for information under any
Antitrust Law. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. The
Parent shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any
Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing, _provided_ that it
shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Parent
nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to (i) make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for
the sale or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment
of a trust or otherwise) of any assets of the Parent or any of its Affiliates
or the Company or any of its Affiliates or the holding separate of the shares
of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or
imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability of the Parent or
any of its Affiliates to conduct their business or own such assets or to
acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Company
Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or (ii) take
any action under this Section if the United States Department of Justice or
the United States Federal Trade Commission authorizes its staff to seek a
preliminary injunction or restraining order, or otherwise initiate
administrative litigation, to enjoin consummation of the Merger.

 



\- 51 -  (c) The Company shall confer with the Parent on a regular and frequent
basis as reasonably requested by the Parent concerning operational matters
and promptly advise the Parent orally and in writing of any change or event
having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, could result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company shall promptly provide to the Parent (or its counsel) copies of all
filings made by the Company with any Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall make any settlement
offers or, except as directed by the Parent, negotiate any consent decree or
consent order with any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent alone shall
be responsible for making any settlement offers and negotiating any consent
decree or consent order with any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall
promptly communicate to the Company if any Governmental Entity suggests or
proffers any settlement, consent decree or consent order, including the
material terms thereof (and any written documentation provided by such
Governmental Entity reflecting the same). The Parent may accept or reject
any settlement, consent decree or consent order proposed by any Governmental
Entity in its sole discretion.

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.2(a), if any "fair price" or
"control share acquisition" or "anti-takeover" statute, or other similar
statute or regulation or any state "blue sky" statute shall become applicable
to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or by the Company Stockholder Agreement, the Company and the Company Board
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby, and
otherwise act to minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent if, at any time (i) any
Change occurs or exists that would result in any representation or warranty
of the Company contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
or Company Material Adverse Effect not being true and accurate in any respect
as if such representation or warranty were made at such time, or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified not being true and
accurate in any material respect as if such representation or warranty were
made at such time, or (ii) the Company fails to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall be deemed to cure any breach or otherwise affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall, within 24 hours after it has notice of any
of the following, notify the Parent of:

(i) any notice or other communication from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



\- 52 -  (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and

(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to the best of its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, if pending
on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or which relate to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) The Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company if, at any time (i) any
Change occurs or exists that would result in any representation or warranty of
the Parent or the Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that is qualified as
to materiality not being true and accurate in any respect as if such
representation or warranty were made at such time, or any such representation
or warranty that is not so qualified not being true and accurate in any
material respect as if such representation or warranty were made at such time,
or (ii) the Parent or the Merger Sub fails to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by them under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall be deemed to cure any breach or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parent or the
Merger Sub or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder.

6.8 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market
regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Parent and (b) the Parent and the Company shall each
use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing,
and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

6.9 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent and the Merger Sub shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation, for a
period of six years from the Effective Time, to honor all of the Companys
obligations to indemnify and advance expenses, to hold harmless and to
exculpate each present and former director and officer of the 

 



\- 53 -   Company (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the extent that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless, advance expenses or exculpate
exist on the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Companys certificate
of incorporation, bylaws, or any agreement listed on Section 6.9(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Parent and the
Merger Sub shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain (to the extent
available in the market) in effect a directors and officers liability
insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and
accurate copy of which has been made available to the Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement) with coverage in amount and scope at least favorable to
such persons as the Companys existing coverage; _provided_ , that in no event
shall the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess
of 200% per year of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage. At the Parents option, the Parent may purchase prior to the
Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions
providing not materially more favorable benefits as the current directors
and officers liability insurance policy covering those persons who are
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy, in which case the Parent and the Merger Sub shall be
relieved of their obligations pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
The Company represents and warrants that the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for directors and officers liability insurance coverage is as
set forth on Section 6.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.

(d) In the event that the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, if the
Parent and the Surviving Corporations successors and assigns do not assume
all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9 by operation of law,
then proper provision shall be made such that such successors and assigns
assume such obligations. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall
not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified
Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive
or impair any rights to 

 



\- 54 -   directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this section is not prior to,
or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 

6.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to the extent such employees remain
employed by the Surviving Corporation ("Company Employees") (i) a base salary
that is not less than the base salary of each such employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except for Company Employees who are subject to the
Companys existing change in control plans or who are covered by an individual
change in control agreement, and (ii) cash incentive compensation and other
employee benefits (excluding equity compensation plans) that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the cash incentive
compensation and other employee benefits provided to comparable employees of
the Parent as of the Effective Time. In addition, for a period of six months
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each Company Employee whose service with the Company is
involuntarily terminated without cause during such six-month period severance
benefits not less than the severance benefits provided to such Company
Employee under the Companys severance practices in effect on the date of this
Agreement, as set forth in Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after
the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall, subject to
applicable law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Employee Plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply (i) to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) for
purposes of any New Plan under which similarly-situated employees of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service, and (iii)
for purposes of any New Plan that is grandfathered or frozen, either with
respect to level of benefits or participation. In addition, but subject to the
proviso of the preceding sentence, (A) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to the
Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), (B)
for purposes of each New Plan providing primarily medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee (each, a "New
Medical Plan"), the Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived

 



\- 55 -   for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under an Old Plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (C) in the event that a Company Employee commences
participation in any New Medical Plan prior to January 1, 2012 or after March
31, 2012, Parent shall work in good faith and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents to be given
credit under the New Medical Plan for amounts paid during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employees
participation in the corresponding New Medical Plan begins, to the same extent
as credit was given under the analogous Old Plan, for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Medical Plan, to the extent information concerning such credit amounts is
timely provided to the New Medical Plan in a commercially usable format and
such crediting is administratively feasible. For the avoidance of doubt, no
such credit shall be provided if the effective date of participation in the
New Medical Plan is on or after January 1, 2012 and before April 1, 2012.

(c) The continued participation and coverage following the Effective
Time under the Company Employee Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the
obligations under Section 6.10(a) and (b) for the time period of such
continued participation and coverage, it being understood that the Company
Employees may commence participating in the employee benefit plans of the
Parent on different dates following the Effective Time.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.10, the
provisions of Sections 6.10(a) and (b) shall apply only with respect to
Company Employees who are primarily employed in the United States. With
respect to Company Employees not described in the preceding sentence, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, comply with all applicable laws relating to employees and
employee benefits matters applicable to such employees.

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.4, the provisions of this
Section 6.10 and of Section 6.11 and 6.14 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director, officer,
employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any
Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or
arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any purpose, (ii)
guarantee employment for any period of time, or preclude the ability of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to terminate any employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason, (iii) require Parent
or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company
Benefit Plan, or provide any employee benefits plans or arrangements, or (iv)
prevent the amendment, modification or termination of any employee benefit
plan or arrangement, in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable law.

 



\- 56 -  6.11 _Treatment of Company Stock Options, RSUs and Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps necessary to
cause all Company Stock Options, whether vested or unvested, that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to become fully vested and
each such Company Stock Option to be cancelled, as of the Effective Time, in
exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and
less any applicable Tax withholding in accordance with Section 2.2(g) with
respect to such payment) determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of such
Company Stock Option by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option (the "Option Consideration"). In the
event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, the Company shall take such action as
is required to cause such Company Stock Option to be cancelled for no
consideration and to have no further force or effect from and after the
Effective Time. At least 10 business days prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall provide the Parent and the Merger Sub with a schedule including
the names of holders of Company Stock Options and the amount of Option
Consideration to be paid to each such holder in respect of such Company Stock
Options pursuant to this Section 6.11(a), which schedule shall be updated by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. Payment of the Option
Consideration shall be made following the Effective Time in accordance with
the Companys payroll practices and, to the extent practicable, as part of the
payment made in respect of the first full payroll period ending after the
Effective Date, but in no event later than 60 days from the Effective Date. 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps necessary to
cause all RSUs, whether vested or unvested, that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time to become fully vested and each such RSU to be
cancelled, as of the Effective Time, in exchange for the right to receive an
amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable Tax withholding in
accordance with Section 2.2(g) with respect to such payment) determined by
multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
RSU by (B) the Merger Consideration (the "RSU Consideration"). At least 10
business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide the
Parent and the Merger Sub with a schedule including the names of holders of
RSUs and the amount of RSU Consideration to be paid to each such holder in
respect of such RSUs pursuant to this Section 6.11(b), which schedule shall be
updated by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. Payment of the
RSU Consideration shall be made following the Effective Time in
accordance with the Companys payroll practices and, to the extent
practicable, as part of the payment made in respect of the first full payroll
period ending after the Effective Date, but in no event later than 60 days
from the Effective Date. 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to terminate each of its Company Stock Plans, including as
described in this Section 6.11, all awards thereunder, effective as of the
Effective Time.

 



\- 57 -  6.12 _Treatment of Company Stock Warrants_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Company Stock Warrants
to be either terminated or exercised prior to the Effective Time, and in the
case of any such termination, in exchange for the right to receive a cash
payment from the Company in an amount equal to the amount obtained by
multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price per share of such Company Stock Warrant by (y) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Warrant. Any Company Stock Warrants that are not terminated prior to the
Effective Time shall be exercisable for a cash payment from the Company in an
amount equal to the amount obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price share of such
Company Stock Warrant by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Warrant. In the event that the exercise
price of any Company Stock Warrant is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, the Company shall take such action as is required to cause such
Company Stock Warrant to be cancelled for no consideration and to have no
further force or effect from and after the Effective Time.

6.13 _401(k) Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Caliper Life Sciences 401(k)
Plan, shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are required
to terminate such plan on the day prior to the Effective Time. The Company
shall preserve all documentation and records related to such plan.

6.14 _Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company Board or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Companys 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or the Companys
2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the "ESPPs"), shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to (i) provide
that any ongoing offering period under the ESPPs shall end as of the Effective
Time and all options then outstanding shall be exercised and (ii) terminate
each ESPP, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time. Until the

as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company;

 



\- 61 -  (b) by either the Parent or the Company:

 

(i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before March 31, 2012 (the "Outside
Date"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose
failure to fulfill any obligations under this Agreement has primarily caused,
or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the Outside
Date;

(ii) if any Governmental Entity issues an order, decree or ruling or takes
any other action, in each case having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling
or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

 

(iii) if at the Company Meeting at which a vote on the Company Voting Proposal
is taken, the Required Company Stockholder Vote in favor of the Company
Voting Proposal shall not have been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(iii)
shall not be available to the Company if (A) at such time the Company is in
breach of or has failed to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or (B)
the failure to obtain the requisite vote has been caused by a breach of the
Company Stockholder Agreement by any party thereto other than the Parent.

(c) by the Parent:

 

(i) if: (A) the Company Board shall have failed to recommend approval of the
Company Voting Proposal in the Proxy Statement or shall have withheld,
withdrawn, qualified or modified its recommendation of the Company Voting
Proposal in a manner adverse to the Parent; (B) following the request of the

recommended to the stockholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal (other
than the Merger); (D) a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock shall have been commenced (other than by the Parent or

the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender or
exchange offer or, within 10 business days after the commencement of such
tender or exchange offer, the Company Board fails to recommend against
acceptance of such offer; or (E) the Company Board or any committee thereof
shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing (each, a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change");

 



\- 62 -  (ii) if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material respect
any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.2 and (B) cannot be or
has not been cured within 20 days after the giving of written notice to the
Company of such breach or failure to perform; or

 

(iii) if the Company breaches (other than in any immaterial respect) the
covenants contained in Section 6.1 or 6.5 of this Agreement.

(d) by the Company

 

(i) if the Parent or the Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform in any
material respect any of their respective representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
materially impairs the Parents and the Merger Subs ability to consummate the
Merger and which breach or failure to perform cannot be or has not been cured
within 20 days after the giving of written notice to the Parent of such breach
or failure to perform ( _provided_ in each case that the Company is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement); or

(ii) if: (A) the Company has not breached (other than any immaterial breach)
Section 6.1; (B) the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal; (C) in
light of such Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall have reasonably
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure of the Company Board to withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable law; (D) the Company has notified the
Parent in writing of the determinations described in clause (C) above on the
date such determinations are made; (E) during at least the five business days
following delivery to the Parent of the notice referred to in Clause (D) above
(or, if such notice is delivered fewer than five business days prior to the
Specified Time, then for the period remaining up to immediately prior to the
Specified Time), the Company provides the Parent with a reasonable opportunity
to propose adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
negotiates in good faith with the Parent with respect thereto so that the
Superior Proposal is no longer determined to be a Superior Proposal by the
Company Board, (F) following the period described in clause (E), and taking
into account any revised proposal that is binding and irrevocable for such
five business day (or, as applicable, shorter) period made by the Parent, such
Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and the Company Board has again
made the determinations referred to in clause (C) above; (G) at or before the
effective time of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(d)(ii), the Company pays to the Parent the fee due under Section 8.3; and

enters into, a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such

9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without

sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by

oral, in each case that is or purports to be legally binding on such person
and as it may be amended or otherwise modified from time to time. As used in
this Agreement, references to the "Companys knowledge" or "knowledge of the
Company", or any other phases of similar meaning, means the knowledge (after

State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
