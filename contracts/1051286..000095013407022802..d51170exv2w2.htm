 _SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION_   

  

 Section 8.1 Survival of Indemnification Rights. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding any right of the Buyer to fully investigate the affairs of the Company and notwithstanding any knowledge of facts determined or determinable by Buyer pursuant to such investigation or right of investigation, Buyer has the right to rely fully on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Sellers contained in this Agreement. All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Closing hereunder, and all such representations and warranties shall thereafter terminate and expire with respect to any theretofore unasserted claim eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date (and no claim for indemnification shall thereafter be made arising from any breaches of any such representations and warranties);  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 4.8_ (Taxes), _Section 4.4(a)(i)_ (with respect to the FERC Certificate only),  _Section 4.11_ (Permits) (with respect to the FERC Certificate only) and _Section 4.14_ (Real Property) shall each survive until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period (after giving affect to any waivers and extensions thereof), (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ and _4.1_  (Organization and Authority), and _Sections 3.7_ and _4.3_ (Capitalization and Ownership) shall survive indefinitely and (iii) the representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 4.9_ (Environmental Matters) shall each survive for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date. All covenants and agreements respectively made by Sellers and Buyer herein to be performed after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing and will remain in full force and effect thereafter until (a) in the case of any covenant or agreement that has a specified term or period, until the thirtieth (30th) day following the expiration of the term or period specified therein; and (b) in the case of any other covenant or agreement that does not have a specified term or period, until the thirtieth (30th) day following the fulfillment thereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) No Party shall have any liability for indemnification claims made under this _Article VIII_ unless a Claim Notice is provided by the non-breaching Party to the other Party in respect of such indemnification claim prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period. If a Claim Notice has been timely given in accordance with this Agreement prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, then the applicable indemnity right shall survive as to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved. 

  

 Section 8.2 Indemnification Obligations. 

   

 (a) Subject to, and except as otherwise provided in this _Article VIII_, from and after the Closing, Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and each of its Affiliates (which from and after the Closing shall include the Company) and their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all MS Hub MIPA Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties incur arising from or out of or related to: 

   

 (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement; 

   

 (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Sellers contained in this Agreement; 

   

 (iii) all Taxes arising from the business operations or the assets of the Company that are imposed for any taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent attributable to Tax items set forth on _Schedule 4.8_ or _Schedule 4.19(c)_; 

   

 (iv) the Excluded Assets; or 

   

 (v) (A) the claims of the Pending Litigation A Plaintiff in connection with the Pending Litigation A, (B) the claims in connection with the Dismissed Case B, and (C) the claims in connection with the Dismissed Case C, and any other action or suit arising out of, related to or in connection with such actions, including all court filings and appeals related thereto (collectively, the " _Specified Claims_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, without limiting in any way the generality of Sellers indemnification obligations under this _Section 8.2(a)(v)_, (X) SELLERS IN NO WAY ACKNOWLEDGE OR AGREE THAT THE PENDING LITIGATION A PLAINTIFF HAS A RIGHT TO INSTITUTE OR PURSUE ANY OTHER ACTION OR SUIT OUTSIDE OF THE PENDING LITIGATION A; (Y) BEAN AND THE COMPANY DISPUTE AND HAVE DENIED THE CLAIMS OF THE PENDING LITIGATION A PLAINTIFF IN CONNECTION WITH THE PENDING LITIGATION A; AND (Z) BEAN AND THE COMPANY DENY ANY LIABILITY IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. 

  

 (b) Subject to, and except as otherwise provided in this _Article VIII_, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and its 

   ##### 

  

   

Affiliates and their respective Representatives, (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all MS Hub MIPA Losses that the
Seller Indemnified Parties incur arising from or out of or related to: 

    

 (i) the businesses and operations of the Company relating to periods after the Closing Date to the extent such MS Hub MIPA Losses are not subject to the provisions of _Section 8.2(a)_ hereto; 

   

 (ii) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement; 

   

 (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement; and 

   

 (iv) any Company Guarantee to the extent related to any failure of the Company to perform any obligation arising after the Closing Date and guaranteed by such Company Guarantee, to the extent such MS Hub MIPA Losses are not subject to  _Section 8.2(a)_. 

  

 (c) For the purposes of calculating the amount of any MS Hub MIPA Loss for which a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, claims indemnification under this Agreement, the amount of each MS Hub MIPA Loss shall be deemed to be an amount (1) net of any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received from any insurer or other third party with respect thereto, and (2) net of any available Tax Benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to such MS Hub MIPA Loss. Buyer and/or Sellers, as applicable, shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to collect indemnity, contribution or other payments from any of their respective insurers or other third party (including using its commercially reasonable efforts to collect insurance proceeds from the Title Company under the Title Policies prior to pursuing any claim against any Seller in respect of any breach of _Section 4.14_). The costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in pursuing any insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or other similar payment from any insurer or other third party shall constitute additional MS Hub MIPA Losses with respect to the matter for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, except to the extent such costs and expenses are paid or reimbursed by such insurer or other third party. 

  

 (d) Subject to clause (c) above, the Parties shall have a duty to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any MS Hub MIPA Loss arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 8.3 Indemnification Procedure. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows: 

   

 (a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party claiming indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any claim 

   ##### 

  

 

asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under
_Section 8.2_ shall promptly (i) notify the other Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") of the Third-Party Claim and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying
Party or Parties a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Third-Party Claim, a copy of all papers
served with respect to such claim (if any), the Indemnified Partys best
estimate of the amount of MS Hub MIPA Losses attributable to the Third-Party
Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification
under this Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not
affect the right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay
or omission, subject to _Section 8.1(b)_. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim (such election to be without prejudice to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute whether such claim is an indemnifiable MS Hub MIPA Loss under this _Article VIII_), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement (including any appeals) at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section 8.3(b)_. In such circumstances, the Indemnifying Party shall defend any such Third-Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof;  _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third party asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim and (ii) the settlement agreement is for money damages and contains only customary settlement provisions, including confidentiality agreements, that do not restrict, in any material respect, the conduct of any business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. Upon the request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third-Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third-Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_, and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. 

  

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall (A) fail to notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of any Claim Notice, or (B) after commencing or undertaking any such defense or settlement, fail to prosecute or withdraw from such defense or settlement, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the 

   ##### 

  

 

Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in
regard to the Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by
all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently
by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third-Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; provided that the Indemnified Party may not enter
into any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim if indemnification
is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
8.3(c_), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses
with respect to such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any Specified Claim, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall comply
with the Supplemental Agreement and, in the event of any conflict between
this _Section 8.3_ and the Supplemental Agreement, the
Supplemental Agreement shall control. 

   

 (d) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_, a claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought, which notice shall set forth the basis of such claim in reasonable detail and be accompanied by evidence supporting the assertion of such claim. 

  

 Section 8.4 Limitations on Liability of Sellers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: 

   

 (a) Except with respect to claims relating to (i) Taxes, (ii) _Section 4.3(b)_, (iii)  _Section 4.13(b)_ and (iv) _Section 8.2(a)(v)_, any single item or group of related items that results in MS Hub MIPA Losses of any Buyer Indemnified Party in an aggregate amount less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) shall be deemed, for all purposes of this _Article VIII_, not to be MS Hub MIPA Losses of such Buyer Indemnified Party recoverable against either Seller or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any such single item or group of related items results in MS Hub MIPA Losses in an aggregate amount greater than or equal to Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000), then the entire amount of such MS Hub MIPA Loss shall constitute a MS Hub MIPA Loss for purposes of this _Article VIII_ ; 

  

 (b) no Seller shall have any liability arising out of or relating to: _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for MS Hub MIPA Losses (other than in respect of any claim under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained in  _Section 4.3(b)_, _Section 4.8_ (Taxes), _Section 4.9_ (Environmental Matters),  _Section 4.13(b)_ and _Section 4.14_ (Real Property)) described in such Sections unless the aggregate amount of such MS Hub MIPA Losses exceeds One Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,300,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), and Sellers shall have liability for such MS Hub MIPA Losses (subject to _Sections 8.4(c)_ and _8.4(e)_ ) only to the extent the aggregate amount of such MS Hub MIPA Losses exceeds the Deductible. For the 

   ##### 

  

 

avoidance of doubt, BRI-Marsh PSA Losses shall not be aggregated with MS Hub
MIPA Losses for purposes of determining whether the Deductible has been
reached; 

   

 (c) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability for MS Hub MIPA Losses described in  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (other than in respect of any claim under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained _Sections 3.1_,  _3.2_ and _4.1_ (Organization and Authority), _Sections 3.7_ and _4.3_  (Capitalization and Ownership), _Section 4.4(i)_ (with respect to the FERC Certificate only),  _Section 4.8_ (Taxes), _Section 4.9_ (Environmental Matters), _Section 4.13(b)_ and _Section 4.14_ (Real Property)) exceed an amount equal to (i) Nineteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($19,500,000), minus (ii) the aggregate amount of MS Hub MIPA Losses paid by Sellers under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ in respect of any claim for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_,  _Section 3.7_, _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.3_ (other than _Section 4.3(b)_),  _Section_   _4.4(i)_ , _Section 4.8_, _Section 4.9_ and _Section 4.14_, minus (iii) the aggregate amount of Capped Section 8.2(a)(v) Losses paid by Sellers under _Section 8.2(a)(v)_. For the avoidance of doubt, although Capped Section 8.2(a)(v) Losses and payments made in respect to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.7_ , _4.1_ , _4.3_ , _4.4(i)_ (with respect to the FERC Certificate only), _4.8_ , _4.9_ , _4.13(b)_ and _4.14_ are not subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.4(c)_, such payments (other than payments made in respect of any claim under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 4.3(b)_ and _4.13(b)_ ) shall be taken into account in determining whether such limitations have been reached; 

  

 (d) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability for MS Hub MIPA Losses described in  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (solely in respect of any claim for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.9_ (Environmental Matters)) exceed an amount equal to (i) Thirty-Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($32,500,000), minus (ii) the aggregate amount of MS Hub MIPA Losses paid by Sellers under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (other than payments made in respect of any claim under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 4.3(b)_ and _4.13(b)_ ), minus (iii) the aggregate amount of Capped Section 8.2(a)(v) Losses paid by Sellers under  _Section 8.2(a)(v)_. For the avoidance of doubt, although Capped Section 8.2(a)(v) Losses and payments made in respect to breaches of the representations and warranties other than those set forth in _Section 4.9_ are not subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.4(d)_ , such payments shall be taken into account in determining whether such limitations have been reached; 

  

 (e) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability for MS Hub MIPA Losses described in  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (solely in respect of any claim for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ and _4.1_  (Organization and Authority), _Sections 3.7_ and _4.3_ (Capitalization and Ownership),  _Section 4.4(i)_ (with respect to the FERC Certificate only), _Section 4.8_ (Taxes), and _Section 4.14_ (Real Property)) exceed an amount equal to (i) the Base Purchase Price, minus (ii) the aggregate amount of MS Hub MIPA Losses paid by Sellers under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (other than payments made in respect of any claims under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for 

   ##### 

  

 

any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained in
_Section 4.3(b)_ ); and 

   

 (f) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability for Capped Section 8.2(a)(v) Losses exceed an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price minus the aggregate amount of MS Hub MIPA Losses paid by Sellers under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (other than payments made in respect of any claims under  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.3(b))_. 

  

 Section 8.5 Purchase Price Adjustment. The Parties agree to treat all payments made pursuant to this _Article VIII_ as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or taxing authority interpretations thereof. 

   

 Section 8.6 Calculation of MS Hub MIPA Losses. 

   

 Following the determination that a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement has occurred, for purposes of computing any MS Hub MIPA Loss under this Article VIII with respect to such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is qualified as to materiality by use of the terms "material", "in all material respects," "Material Adverse Effect" or words of substantially equivalent meaning, the amount of the MS Hub MIPA Loss shall be the entire MS Hub MIPA Loss arising by reason of the breach of such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and not merely the amount of such MS Hub MIPA Loss in excess of the minimum amount that would result in such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement being breached. 

  

 Section 8.7 Exclusive Remedy. 

   

 (a) Subject to _Section 9.3_ and _Section 10.6_, any claim or cause of action (whether such claim sounds in tort, contract or otherwise and including statutory rights and remedies) based upon, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby must be brought by any Party in accordance with the provisions and applicable limitations of this _Article VIII_, which shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of all Parties, their Affiliates, successors and assigns for any such claim or cause of action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall retain the right to receive damages or other appropriate relief (including equitable relief) against the Sellers as a result of any actual fraud perpetrated by any Seller against the Buyer without regard to any restriction or limitation contained herein. 

  

 (b) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ASSERTED BY OR AWARDED, PAID OR PAYABLE TO A THIRD PARTY, NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT FROM ANY OTHER PARTYS SOLE, 

   ##### 

  

 

JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT. 

   

 Section 8.8 Escrow Fund. The obligations of the Sellers under _Section 8.2_ shall be satisfied first from the monies held in escrow pursuant to the MS Hub MIPA Escrow Agreement (the " _MS Hub MIPA Escrow Fund_ "). If the MS Hub MIPA Escrow Fund is inadequate to provide indemnification to Buyer as provided in _Section 8.2_, the obligations of Sellers under  _Section 8.2_ shall be satisfied by Sellers, jointly and severally, subject to the limitations set forth herein. The MS Hub MIPA Escrow Fund shall be held by the MS Hub MIPA Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the MS Hub MIPA Escrow Agreement, and the MS Hub MIPA Escrow Fund shall be (i) for the benefit of the Sellers and BRI-Marsh and (ii) security for the Sellers obligations to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and BRI-Marshs obligations to Buyer pursuant to the BRI-Marsh PSA. 

   

 Section 8.9 Offset Against Additional Monies Owed to Sellers. In the event that Buyer has an unresolved claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_, then Buyer shall be entitled to hold back the amount of any such claim from any potential payments due to the Sellers pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (the " _Holdback_ ") until the earlier of (i) such time as Buyer and the Sellers mutually resolve their differences of (ii) such time as Buyer is directed to disburse such funds after giving effect to the dispute resolution procedures of _Article X_. To the extent the Holdback and the MS Hub MIPA Escrow Fund are insufficient to cover any claims under this _Article VIII_, the Sellers shall remain responsible, subject to _Section 8.4_. 

   

ARTICLE IX 

   

 _TERMINATION_   

  

 Section 9.1 Termination. At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned: 

   

 (a) by the mutual consent of Buyer and Sellers as evidenced in writing signed by each of Buyer and each Seller; 

  

 (b) by Buyer, if there has been a material breach by Sellers of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Buyer at the Closing and, if such breach is of a character that it is capable of being cured, such breach has not been cured by Sellers within fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof from Buyer; 

  

 (c) by Sellers, if there has been a material breach by Buyer of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Sellers at the Closing and, if such breach is of a character that it is capable of being cured, such breach has not been cured by Buyer within fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof from Sellers; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) by either Buyer or Sellers: 

   

 (i) if any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, decree, ruling or injunction (other than a temporary restraining order) or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or 

   

 (ii) if the Closing has not occurred (other than through the failure of any Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before November 29, 2007 or such later date as the Parties may agree upon in writing (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ , that if, as of the End Date, all conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those that are to be satisfied by action taken at the Closing) other than the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(f)_ and _Section 7.2(e)_ , then the End Date shall automatically be extended without further action by the Parties until December 28, 2007. 

  

 Section 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any Party hereto; _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve Sellers from any liability or obligation with respect to any willful breach of this Agreement. The Limited Guaranty referred to in _Section 5.10_ and the provisions of  _Section 6.9_, this _Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_, _Section 11.1_,  _Section 11.4_, _Section 11.8_, and _Section 11.10_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 9.3 Termination Fee. 

   

 (a) If this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_, then Buyer shall pay to Sellers an aggregate amount equal to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ ") within three (3) Business Days after the date of termination. 

  

 (b) The Parties agree and understand that payment of the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Sellers for their respective efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. 

  

 (c) Each of Sellers and Buyer acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, neither Sellers nor Buyer would have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer (or any Guarantor) fails promptly to pay or cause to be paid the amounts due pursuant to this  _Section 9.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, any Seller commences an arbitration proceeding that results in a 

   ##### 

  

 

judgment or award against Buyer or any Guarantor for the amounts set forth in
this _Section 9.3_, Buyer (or the Guarantors) shall pay to such Seller
its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such arbitration proceeding and any appeal relating thereto,
together with interest on the amounts set forth in this _Section 9.3_ at the
prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Sellers right to terminate and receive the Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers against Buyer, Guarantors
and their respective Representatives (including their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,
members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents) for, and such amount shall
constitute liquidated damages in respect of, the breach or termination of
this Agreement described in  _Section 9.1(c)_ regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to such breach or termination and Sellers shall
have no further rights, directly or indirectly, against Buyer, Guarantors or
any of their respective Representatives (including their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,
members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents), whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ARBITRATION PROCEEDING, EACH PARTY MUST SUBMIT OR FILE ANY CLAIM WHICH WOULD CONSTITUTE A COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM (AS DEFINED BY RULE 13 OF THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE) WITHIN THE SAME PROCEEDING AS THE CLAIM TO WHICH IT RELATES. ANY SUCH CLAIM WHICH IS NOT SUBMITTED OR FILED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL BE FOREVER BARRED. 

  

 (d) THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL, AND NOT A CLASS-WIDE, BASIS, AND

SUBSIDIARIES, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES
AND ANY OTHER PARTY (OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES) MAY NOT BE CONSOLIDATED WITH ANY
OTHER ARBITRATION PROCEEDING BETWEEN ANY OF THE PARTIES AND ANY THIRD
PARTY. 

   

 Section 10.5 Applicable Law. Except as provided in _Section 10.4(a)_ with respect to arbitration matters, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the Laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflict of law principles thereof). 

   

 Section 10.6 Provisional Remedies. The procedures specified in this _Article X_ shall be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of disputes between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Party, without prejudice to the above procedures, may file a complaint (for statute of limitations or venue reasons) or to seek preliminary injunction or other provisional judicial relief, without requirement of bond or the showing of irreparable injury or adequacy of damages, if in its sole judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that despite any such action, the Parties shall continue to participate in good faith in the procedures specified in this _Article X_. Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this _Section 10.6_ or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof shall be brought and determined in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas or if such legal action or proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, in the state courts of the State of Texas in Harris County, Texas. Each of the Parties hereby (a) irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, (b) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court or it shall not bring any motion that such action is brought in an inconvenient forum and (c) agrees that it shall not bring any such action in any court other than any Texas state or federal court sitting in Houston, Texas. Each of the Parties waives trial by jury in any action to which they are parties involving, directly or indirectly, any matter in any way arising out of, related to or connected with this _Section 10.6_.

or to such other address or addresses as the Parties may from time to time
designate as to itself by like notice. Except as provided in _Section 8.1_,
the failure of any Party to make a timely delivery of notice or any other
delivery provided for in this Agreement shall not relieve the receiving Party
from any of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
receiving Party is actually harmed thereby. 

   

 Section 11.2 Assignment. No Party shall assign this Agreement or any part hereof without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that Buyer may assign any and all of its rights and interests hereunder to financing parties 

   ##### 

  

   

in connection with a debt financing, or to one or more of its Affiliates (it
being understood that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer or any Guarantor
of its obligations hereunder). Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns. 

   

 Section 11.3 Rights of Third Parties. Except for the provisions of _Section 8.2_, which are intended to be enforceable by the Persons respectively referred to therein, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than the Parties, any right or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 11.4 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions herein contemplated hereby whether or not such transactions shall be consummated, including all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants. 

   

 Section 11.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be deemed originals. 

   

 Section 11.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Disclosure Schedule and exhibits to this Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. No representations, warranties, covenants, understandings or agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exist between Buyer, on the one hand, and either Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 Section 11.7 Disclosure Schedule. Unless the context otherwise requires, all capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedule shall have the respective meanings assigned in this Agreement. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by either Seller, in and of itself, that such information is material to or outside the ordinary course of the business of the Company or is required to be disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule. Each numbered Schedule in the Disclosure Schedules qualifies only the correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein and, except in the case of _Section 4.3_ and  _Section 4.13(b)_, such other representations, warranties or 

   ##### 

  

   

covenants to the extent a matter in such numbered Schedule is disclosed in

covenant reasonably apparent. 

   

 Section 11.8 Amendments, Supplements, Etc. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented at any time by additional written agreements executed by both Buyer and each Seller as may mutually be determined by the Parties to be necessary, desirable or expedient to further the purpose of this Agreement or to clarify the intention of the Parties. 

   

 Section 11.9 Publicity. On the date of this Agreement each Seller and Buyer shall prepare a press release in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for public dissemination on or after the date of this Agreement and each Seller and Buyer shall mutually agree on each such press release prior to public dissemination. Except as otherwise required by Law or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange, no Party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without prior consultation with and consent of the other Party. 

   

 Section 11.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the rights or obligations under this Agreement of Sellers on the one hand and Buyer on the other hand will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.
