<PAGE>

     and all property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due on whatever
     account, as well as stock subscriptions and all other choses or things in
     action, and all and every other interest of or belonging to or due to
     either of the Merging Corporations, shall be taken by and deemed to be
     transferred to and shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation without

     and franchises, property, debts, choses or things in action, and all and
     every other interest of each of the Merging Corporations shall be
     thereafter as effectually the property of the Surviving Corporation as they
     were of the respective Merging Corporations, and the title to any real or
     other property, or any interest therein, whether vested by deed or
     otherwise, in either of the Merging Corporations, shall not revert or be in
     any way impaired by reason of the merger, provided, however, that all
     rights of creditors and all liens upon any properties of each of the
     Merging Corporations shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts,
     liabilities, restrictions, obligations, and duties of the respective
     Merging Corporations, including without limitation all obligations,
     liabilities and duties as lessee under any existing lease, shall
     thenceforth attach to the Surviving Corporation and may be enforced against
     and by it to the same extent as if such debts, liabilities, duties,
     restrictions and obligations had been incurred or contracted by it. Any
     action or proceeding pending by or against either of the Merging
     Corporations may be prosecuted to judgment as if the merger had not taken
     place, or the Surviving Corporation may be substituted in place of either
     of the Merging Corporations.

          1.10.2. Conveyances to Surviving Corporation. The Merging Corporations
     hereby agree, respectively, that from time to time, as and when requested
     by the Surviving Corporation, or by its successors and assigns, they will

     conveyances, assignments, permits, licenses and other instruments, and will
     take or cause to be taken such further or other action as the Surviving
     Corporation, its successors or assigns, may deem necessary or desirable to
     vest or perfect in or confirm to the Surviving Corporation, its successors
     and assigns, title to and possession of all the property, rights,
     privileges, powers, immunities, franchises, and interests referred to in
     this Paragraph 1.10 and otherwise carry out the intent and purposes of this
     Agreement.

          1.10.3. Accounting Treatment. The assets and liabilities of the
     Merging Corporations shall be taken up on the books of the Surviving
     Corporation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

          1.10.4. Dissenting Stockholders of GSE. Notwithstanding anything in
     this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of GSE Common Stock issued and
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date and held by a holder (a
     "Dissenting Stockholder") who has not voted in favor of the merger or
     consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for
     such Common Shares in accordance with the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall
     not be converted into a right to receive the merger consideration on the
     Effective Date in accordance with Paragraph 1.9.5 hereof, but shall
     represent and become the right to receive such consideration as may be
     determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the laws of
     the State of Delaware, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or
     withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal and payment
     under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Date, such holder fails

                                       7

<PAGE>

     to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to
     appraisal, such former Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be
     treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Date into a right
     to receive, upon surrender as provided above, the merger consideration,
     without any interest thereon, in accordance with Paragraph 1.9.5 hereof.
     GSE shall give Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands received by GSE for
     appraisal of GSE Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
     instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by GSE and Merger Sub
     shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
     respect to such demands. GSE shall not, except with the prior written
     consent of Merger Sub, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
     to settle, any such demands.

     1.11. Payoff of Indebtedness. On the Effective Date, GSE shall repay the
indebtedness set forth on Schedule 1.11 pursuant to the Payoff Letters.

     normal equitable principles) in accordance with its terms, except as
     enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
     debtor relief or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

     business in all jurisdictions in which the character of the properties
     owned or the nature of the business conducted makes such qualification or
     licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or
     licensed would not result in a Material Adverse Change.

     pending such sale or other disposition of assets, businesses or voting
     securities of Parent, of Merger Sub or of GSE or any of its subsidiaries,

     including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the
     stockholders of the Company, (ii) declared the Merger and this Agreement to
     be advisable and (iii) recommended unanimously that the stockholders of the

     with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) any claims,
     actions, proceedings or governmental investigations commenced or, to its

     failure to occur, of any event that would be likely to cause any
     representation or warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement
     to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (d) any failure of the
     Company or Merger Sub, as the case may be, or of any officer, director,
     employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
     condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder,
     (e) the occurrence of any event that would constitute a material breach of
     any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement had
     such representations or warranties been made as of the occurrence of such
     event and (f) any "Material Adverse Change" of such party, whether or not

     incidents) not having an effect (directly or indirectly) upon GSE's
     business or financial condition. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
     to the contrary, no notification pursuant to this Paragraph 4.1.3 shall
     affect the representations, warranties or covenants of any party or the
     conditions to the obligations of any party hereunder, nor shall it limit or
     otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
     such notice;

           4.1.4. Further Assurances. Each of Parent (for itself and on behalf
     of Merger Sub) and GSE shall use all reasonable efforts to fulfill, or
     obtain the fulfillment of, the conditions to be fulfilled or obtained by it
     prior to the Effective Date, including, without limitation, the execution
     and delivery of all agreements contemplated hereunder to be so executed and
     delivered, and to otherwise take, or cause to be taken all action, and to

          indirectly authorize or permit any of its affiliates, representatives

          to: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage (including by way of furnishing
          information) or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiry or
          the making of any proposal which constitutes, or may reasonably be
          expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of
          15% or more of the assets (by value) or GSE Common Stock, any tender
          offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
          or entity beneficially owning 15% or more of the GSE Common Stock, or
          any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantially
          all assets, sale of securities, recapitalization, liquidation,
          dissolution or similar transaction involving GSE (other than the
          transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or any other material
          corporate transaction the consummation of which would or could
          reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or
          materially delay the merger contemplated by this Agreement
          (collectively, "GSE Transaction Proposals") or agree to or endorse any
          GSE Transaction Proposal or (ii) propose, enter into or participate in
          any discussions or negotiations regarding any of the foregoing, or
          furnish to another person or entity any information with respect to
          its business, properties or assets or any of the foregoing, or
          otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in,
          facilitate or encourage, an effort or attempt by any other person or
          entity to do or seek to do any of the foregoing, provided, however,
          that the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall not prohibit GSE from
          (a) furnishing information pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality
          and standstill letter no more favorable to such person or entity than
          the confidentiality agreement with Parent concerning GSE and its
          businesses, properties or assets to such person or entity who has made
          a Superior GSE Transaction Proposal (as defined below) or (b) engaging
          in discussions or negotiations with such a third party who has made a
          Superior GSE Transaction Proposal but in each case referred to in the
          foregoing clauses (a) and (b) only after the board of directors of GSE
          concludes in good faith following advice of its outside counsel that
          such action would be required for the board of directors of GSE to
          comply with its fiduciary obligations to stockholders under applicable
          law. If the board of directors of GSE receives a GSE Transaction
          Proposal, then GSE shall immediately inform Parent of the terms and
          conditions of such proposal and the identity of the person or entity
          making it and shall keep Parent fully informed of the status and
          details of any such GSE Transaction Proposal and of all steps it is
          taking in response to such GSE Transaction Proposal; provided that
          nothing contained in this Subparagraph 4.2.11.1 shall prohibit GSE or
          its board of directors from making any disclosure to GSE's
          stockholders which, in the good faith judgment of GSE's board of
          directors, may be required under applicable law. For purposes of this
          Agreement, the term "Superior GSE Transaction Proposal" shall mean a
          bonafide GSE Transaction Proposal made by any person or entity (other
          than Parent and Merger Sub) to acquire, directly or indirectly, for
          consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more that 50% of
          the voting power of the GSE Common Stock then outstanding or all or
          substantially all of

                                       29

<PAGE>

          the assets of GSE and otherwise on terms that the board of directors
          of GSE determines in good faith after consultation with (and based in
          part on the advice of) its independent financial advisors to be more
          favorable, from a financial point of view, to GSE's stockholders than

     as specified by such counsel (such exceptions to be acceptable to GSE) such
     counsel does not know of any material litigation, proceedings or
     governmental investigation, pending or threatened against or relating to
     Parent or Merger Sub or its properties or businesses in which it is sought

     this Agreement. Such opinion shall also cover such other matters incident
     to the transactions herein contemplated as GSE and its counsel may
     reasonably request and shall be subject to customary exceptions and
     qualifications reasonably satisfactory to GSE. In rendering such opinion,
     such counsel may rely upon (i) certificates of public officials and of
     officers of Parent and Merger Sub as to matters of fact and (ii) on the
     opinion or opinions of other counsel, which opinions shall be reasonably
     satisfactory to GSE, as to matters other than federal or Illinois law or
     governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

            5.2.3. Stockholder Approval. At the GSE Stockholder Meeting, the
     holders of the requisite majority of the outstanding shares of GSE Common
     Stock shall have approved the merger contemplated by this Agreement.

     shall have expired with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement, or early termination with respect thereto shall have been
     obtained. In addition, any approvals required under any state or foreign
     laws comparable to HSR shall have been obtained.

            5.2.5. Financing Completed. Parent and Merger Sub shall have
     concluded the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Letter, the
     proceeds of which (together with the equity financing proceeds) in an
     amount at least equal to (i) the GSE Merger Consideration shall have been
     deposited by Merger Sub (in trust for the benefit of the holders of GSE
     Common Stock being converted into the right to receive cash on the
     Effective Date) with the Exchange Agent pursuant to an agreement that is in
     form and substance acceptable to GSE, and (ii) the GSE Option Consideration
     shall have been deposited by Merger Sub in a segregated account for use in
     satisfying the Surviving Corporation's obligations under Paragraphs 1.9.5.2
     and 1.9.5.3.

     6.1. Termination. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the merger contemplated
hereby abandoned at any time (including after the approval and adoption thereof
by the stockholders of Merger Sub or GSE) before the Effective Date:

            6.1.1. By Mutual Consent. By mutual consent of GSE and Parent (for
     itself and on behalf of Merger Sub);

            6.1.2. By Parent Because of Dissenting Stockholders. By Parent (for
     itself and on behalf of Merger Sub), if the holders of 5% or more shares of
     the outstanding GSE Common Stock elect to exercise the right to dissent

     contemplated by this Agreement;


                                       38

<PAGE>

            6.1.3. By GSE Because of Conditions Precedent. By GSE, if through no
     material fault of GSE (i) any of the representations and warranties of
     Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement were untrue when made or
     have since become untrue, such that the failure of the applicable
     representations and warranties to be true and correct would cause the
     condition set forth in Paragraph 5.2.1 to be deemed not to be fulfilled, or
     (ii) Parent and/or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to comply in
     any material respect with any of their respective obligations under this
     Agreement and shall not have cured such breach or failure to comply within
     ten business days after notice from GSE, or (iii) any other events and
     circumstances have occurred such that, in any such case, the conditions set
     forth in Paragraph 5.2 applicable to GSE's obligation to consummate the
     merger contemplated by this Agreement could not be satisfied within five
     business days after the conditions set forth in Paragraph 5.1 are first
     either satisfied or unconditionally capable of being satisfied by GSE;

            6.1.4. By GSE or Parent Due to a Superior GSE Transaction Proposal.
     By either GSE or Parent (for itself and on behalf of Merger Sub) if, before
     the Effective Date, (i) GSE's board of directors shall have withdrawn, or
     modified in a manner adverse to, its approval or recommendation of this
     Agreement or the merger contemplated hereby or (ii) GSE shall have entered
     into an agreement providing for a Superior GSE Transaction, provided that
     GSE shall have the right to terminate under this Paragraph 6.1.4 only if
     GSE has complied in full with the terms, conditions and procedures set
     forth in Subparagraph 4.2.11.2;

            6.1.5. By Parent Because of Conditions Precedent. By Parent (for
     itself and on behalf of Merger Sub), if through no material fault of Parent
     or Merger Sub (i) any of the representations and warranties of GSE
     contained in this Agreement were untrue when made or have since become
     untrue, such that the failure of the applicable representations and
     warranties to be true and correct would cause the condition set forth in
     Paragraph 5.1.1 to be deemed not to be fulfilled, or (ii) GSE shall have
     breached or failed to comply in any material respect with any of its
     obligations under this Agreement and shall not have cured such breach or
     failure to comply within ten business days after notice from Parent, or
     (iii) any other events and circumstances have occurred such that, in any
     such case, the conditions set forth in Paragraph 5.1 applicable to the
     obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger contemplated
     by this Agreement could not be satisfied within five business days after
     the conditions set forth in Paragraph 5.2 are first either satisfied or
     unconditionally capable of being satisfied by Parent and Merger Sub;

            6.1.6. By Parent Because of Material Adverse Change. By Parent (for
     itself and on behalf of Merger Sub), if there has been a Material Adverse
     Change in GSE since the date of the financial statements contained in the
     most recent Report (prior to the date of this Agreement) filed with the
     Commission under the Exchange Act;

            6.1.7. By GSE or Parent Because of Legal Proceedings. By either GSE
     or Parent (for itself and on behalf of Merger Sub) if any party shall be
     subject to any final, nonappealable order, decree or injunction of a court
     of competent jurisdiction or governmental regulatory body that makes
     illegal, enjoins or prevents the consummation of the merger contemplated by
     this Agreement substantially as an entirety; or


                                       39

<PAGE>

            6.1.8. By GSE or Parent if Merger due to Lapse of Time. By either
     GSE or Parent (for itself and on behalf of Merger Sub), if the merger shall
     not have become effective on or before June 30, 2004; provided, however,
     that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Paragraph 6.1.8 shall
     not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under
     this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
     Effective Date to occur on or before such date; provided further that such
     time period shall be tolled for (i) a number of days equal to the number of
     days not to exceed 90 during which any party shall be subject to a nonfinal
     order, decree, ruling or action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
     prohibiting the consummation of the merger contemplated by this Agreement
     or the holding of the GSE Stockholder Meeting, and (ii) in addition, the
     number of days not to exceed 90 during which any party shall have failed to
     achieve "deemed substantial compliance" under HSR within 30 days following
     a second request from the United States Federal Trade Commission (or the
     Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice) for information concerning
     the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such that any party not
     then in default of any obligation hereunder shall have the right to
     terminate this Agreement under this Paragraph 6.1.8, at any time after
     December 27, 2004.

     6.2. Termination by Board of Directors. An election of GSE to terminate
this Agreement and abandon the merger as provided in Paragraph 6.1 shall be
exercised on behalf of GSE by its board of directors. An election of Parent or
Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement and abandon the merger as provided in
Paragraph 6.1 shall be exercised on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub by Parent's
board of directors.

     6.3. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination and abandonment
of this Agreement pursuant to and in strict compliance with the provisions of
Paragraph 6.1.4, GSE shall be subject to the remedies referred to in
Subparagraph 4.2.11.3. In all other events (excepting the obligations referred
to in Paragraphs 4.2.5 (regarding confidentiality), 6.5, 7.1, 7.2 and 8.1
hereof), this Agreement shall become void and have no effect after termination
and abandonment without any liability pursuant to this Agreement on the part of
any party hereto (or its stockholders or controlling persons or directors or
officers); provided that such termination shall not relieve any party of any
liability for any willful breach of this Agreement.

     6.4. Waiver of Conditions. Subject to the requirements of any applicable
law, any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement may be waived in writing
at any time by the party which is entitled to the benefit thereof, by action
taken by its board of directors, the executive committee of its board of
directors, or its chief executive officer.

     6.5. Expense on Termination. If the merger contemplated hereby is abandoned
pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 6.1 hereof, all
expenses will be paid by the party incurring them.

                                  ARTICLE VII.
                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     7.1. Indemnification by Parent as to Proxy Statement. Parent agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless GSE and its officers and directors and each person
or entity who controls GSE


                                       40

<PAGE>

within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act") or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities, joint or several, to which any of them may
become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other statute
or common law, and to reimburse them for any legal or other expenses incurred by
them in connection with investigating any claims and defending any actions, to
the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or actions arise out of or
are based upon (i) any false, misleading or untrue statement or alleged false,
misleading or untrue statement of a material fact, insofar as it relates to
Parent or Merger Sub, if such statement was provided to GSE by Parent or Merger
Sub in writing expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and such statement
was contained in the Proxy Statement in the form mailed to the stockholders of
GSE, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Proxy Statement a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading if such omission was omitted from a writing provided to
GSE by Parent or Merger Sub expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, and
insofar as the same relates to Parent or Merger Sub.

     7.2. Indemnification by GSE as to Proxy Statement. GSE agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless Parent, Merger Sub and the officers and directors and each
person or entity who controls each of them within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities, joint or several, to which any of them may
become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other statute
or common law, and to reimburse them for any legal or other expenses incurred by
them in connection with investigating any claims and defending any actions, to
the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or actions arise out of or
are based upon (i) any false, misleading or untrue statement or alleged false,
misleading or untrue statement of a material fact, insofar as it relates to GSE
contained in the Proxy Statement in the form mailed to the stockholders of GSE
or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Proxy Statement a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and insofar as the same relates to GSE.

     7.3. Concerning GSE's Directors and Officers. Parent and GSE jointly and
severally agree that:

            7.3.1. Indemnification. From and after the Effective Date, the
     Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person
     who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Date, an officer
     or director of GSE (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and
     against all losses, claims, damages and expenses to the extent not covered
     by insurance and paid (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses)
     arising out of or relating to actions or omissions or alleged actions or
     omissions, of such person by virtue of his or her service as an officer or
     director of GSE occurring at or prior to the Effective Date to the fullest
     extent permitted by the DGCL, but excluding any of the foregoing which
     relate to any violation or alleged violation of the Exchange Act with
     respect to insider trading;

            7.3.2. Eligibility Determination. Any initial determination required
     to be made with respect to whether any Indemnified Party may be entitled to
     indemnification will, if

                                       41

<PAGE>

     requested by such Indemnified Party, be made by independent legal counsel
     selected by the Indemnified Party;

             7.3.3. Advance Defense Costs. To the fullest extent permitted under
     the DGCL, the Surviving Corporation shall pay on an as-incurred basis the
     reasonable fees and expenses of each Indemnified Party (including
     reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in advance of the final
     disposition of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that is the
     subject of the right to indemnification, subject to receipt from the
     Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced of the undertaking to repay
     such advances in the event such Indemnified Party is determined by final
     nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction to be not entitled
     to indemnification;

             7.3.4. Separate Counsel in Certain Events. In the event any action,
     suit, investigation or proceeding is brought against any Indemnified
     Parties and under applicable standards of professional conduct there is a
     conflict of interest on any significant issue between the position of the
     Surviving Corporation and an Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Parties may
     retain counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
     Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
     reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
     promptly as statements therefor are received; provided however, that (i)
     the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense
     thereof (which right shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Parties
     to be reimbursed for separate counsel as specified above), (ii) the
     Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and
     (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
     effected without its prior written consent. The Indemnified Parties as a
     group may not retain more than one counsel to represent them with respect
     to each such matter unless under applicable standards of professional
     conduct there is a conflict of interest on any significant issue between
     the positions of two or more Indemnified Parties;

             7.3.5. Notice of Claim. Upon learning of any loss, claim, damage or
     expense which may give rise to a claim for indemnity hereunder, any
     Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation thereof
     in writing, but any failure to give such notice shall not affect the
     indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this
     Paragraph 7.3 unless such failure jeopardizes or prejudices the Surviving
     Corporation in any material respect;

             7.3.6. Insurance Tail. For a period of six years after the
     Effective Date, the Surviving Corporation will use its commercially
     reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained in effect policies of
     directors' and officers' liability insurance substantially equivalent in
     scope and amount of coverage to the policies maintained by GSE as of the
     date of this Agreement with respect to claims arising from or relating to
     actions or omissions, or alleged actions or omissions, occurring on or
     prior to the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
     Paragraph 7.3.6, the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to make
     total premium payments with respect to such policies of insurance to the
     extent such premiums exceed 300 percent of the last annual premium paid by
     GSE prior to the date of this Agreement. If the annual premium costs
     necessary to maintain such insurance coverage exceed the foregoing amount,
     GSE will use its


                                       42

<PAGE>

     commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies
     of directors' and officers' liability insurance reasonably obtainable for
     an annual premium not exceeding the foregoing amount, provided that
     Indemnified Parties may be required to make application and provide
     customary representations and warranties to the insurance carrier for the
     purpose of obtaining such insurance. GSE further agrees (i) to cooperate
     with Parent and Merger Sub and to provide Parent and Merger Sub (and their
     Affiliates) and their insurance broker(s) with any documents or information
     requested by Parent and/or Merger Sub and to allow Parent and Merger Sub
     (and their Affiliates) and their insurance broker(s) to approach the
     current insurance carriers of GSE and any additional carriers to negotiate
     and acquire any directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage, (ii)
     to designate the broker of record for purposes of negotiating all such
     directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, and (iii) if
     requested by Parent and/or Merger Sub, to cancel all existing directors'
     and officers' liability insurance policies prior to the Effective Time in
     connection with the corresponding purchase of replacement coverage or
     extensions, as directed by Parent and/or Merger Sub;

             7.3.7. Existing Rights Preserved. The provisions relating to
     director and officer indemnification, abrogation of liability and
     advancement of expenses in the certificate of incorporation and/or bylaws
     of GSE as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof will apply to each
     Indemnified Party with respect to all matters occurring on or prior to the
     Effective Date. The foregoing will not be deemed to restrict the right of
     the Surviving Corporation to modify the provisions of its certificate of
     incorporation and/or bylaws relating to director and officer
     indemnification, abrogation of liability or advancement of expenses with
     respect to events or occurrences after the Effective Date but such
     modifications shall not adversely affect the rights of the Indemnified
     Parties as set forth in this Agreement or in any preexisting written
     contract of indemnity between an Indemnified Party and GSE;

             7.3.8. Indemnified Parties are Third Party Beneficiaries. Anything
     else in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the provisions of
     this Paragraph 7.3 will survive the consummation of the merger, and each
     Indemnified Party will, for all purposes, be a third party beneficiary of
     the covenants and agreements contained in this Paragraph 7.3 and,
     accordingly, will be treated as a party to this Agreement for purposes of
     the rights and remedies relating to enforcement of such covenants and
     agreements and will be entitled to enforce any such rights and exercise any
     such remedies directly against Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation.

     7.4. Employee Benefits. For a period of one year from the Effective Date,
the Surviving Corporation shall continue providing benefits and compensation to
or for the benefit of current employees of GSE who continue to be employed after
the Effective Date at levels substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those
in effect on the Effective Date; provided, however, that such undertaking does
not include any obligation to cause any new benefit to be granted to any
employee after the Effective Date under any GSE Benefit Plan, the Surviving
Corporation's sole obligation (except to the limited extent otherwise provided
in Paragraph 7.5) with respect to which shall be to continue to honor previously
granted benefits in accordance with their terms, as the same may have been
changed by operation of law (in the case of stock based benefits) upon
consummation of the merger contemplated by this Agreement.


                                       43

<PAGE>

     7.5. Option Notice. On or promptly following the Effective Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall transmit a written notice to each holder (at his
record address) of an "in-the-money" stock option (determined using the price
set forth in Paragraph 1.9.3 above) canceled pursuant to Paragraph 1.9.3.2
informing such holder of such holder's rights and obligations under Paragraphs
1.9.3.2 and 1.9.5.2.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     8.1. Entirety. This Agreement (including the other agreements referenced
herein) embodies the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and all prior agreements between the parties with respect
thereto are hereby superseded in their entirety, except that the Confidentiality
Agreement dated as of November 19, 2003 (the "Confidentiality Agreement") by and
between Parent and HWCo (of which GSE is an express third party beneficiary)
remains in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and is unaffected
by this Agreement.

     8.2. Counterparts. Any number of counterparts of this Agreement may be
executed and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument,
but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one instrument.

     8.3. Notices and Waivers. Any notice or waiver to be given to any party
hereto shall be in writing and shall be delivered by courier, sent by facsimile
transmission or first class registered or certified mail, postage prepaid.

     8.4. Termination of Representations, Warranties, etc. The respective
representations and warranties contained in Articles II and III shall expire
with, and be terminated and extinguished by, the merger pursuant to this
Agreement at the time of the consummation thereof on the Effective Date. This
Paragraph 8.4 shall have no effect upon any other right or obligation of the

     8.5. Table of Contents and Captions. The table of contents and captions
contained in this Agreement are solely for convenient reference and shall not be
deemed to affect the meaning or interpretation of any Article, Section,
Paragraph or Subparagraph hereof.

     8.6. Successors and Assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by GSE without
the prior written consent of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub may assign in whole
or in part its rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to one or more
of its affiliates or to any of its lenders as collateral security; provided,
however, that if Parent or Merger Sub assigns all or any of such party's rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement, such assigning party shall remain
liable for such party's obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

     8.7. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be
the intention of the parties that they would have executed the remaining terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such which may
be hereafter declared invalid, void or unenforceable.

     8.8. Injunctive and Other Relief. The parties hereto agree that in the
event of a breach of any provision of this Agreement, Parent or Merger Sub may
be without an adequate remedy at law. The parties therefore agree that in the
