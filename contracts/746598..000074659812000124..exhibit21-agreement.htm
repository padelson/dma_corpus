Section 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the California Code, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a
result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation and as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent following the Merger.

Section 1.02 Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to Section 9.01, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place no later than one (1) Business Day after the satisfaction or, if
permissible, written waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, at

may be changed to another place, date and/or time as agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs is
herein referred to as the "Closing Date." On the Closing Date, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the appropriate
certificates and agreement (collectively, the "Certificate of Merger") with
the Secretary of State of the State of California, in such form as required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the California
Code (the date and time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State
of California of such filing or, if another date and time is specified in such
filing, such specified date and time, being the "Effective Time").

Section 1.03 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the California
Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property,
assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
duties and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Corporation.



Section 1.04 Articles of Incorporation; By-laws. At the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in their entirety to contain the provisions set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 6.02.

Section 1.05 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles
of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.


ARTICLE II

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EFFECT ON COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES

Section 2.01 Effect of the Merger on the Company Capital Stock and the Capital
Stock of Merger Sub.

(a) Effect on the Company Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
the Company Shareholders, each share of each series or class of Company
Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, all shares of Company Capital Stock issued upon
exercise of any Options shall, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Section 2.01 and elsewhere in this Agreement, be canceled
and extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to receive that
portion of the Merger Consideration as set forth herein; provided, however,
that the amount payable to any Holder of Company Capital Stock who is an
obligor on a Management Note shall be reduced by the principal amount of such
Management Note plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon at the Effective
Time, and such Management Note shall be deemed cancelled thereafter.

(i) Each share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive a portion of the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
Distribution Waterfall.

(ii) For purposes of calculating the amount to be paid to each holder of
Company Capital Stock at the Effective Time, the amounts described in Section
2.01(a) shall be calculated assuming that the Merger Consideration is equal to
the Initial Merger Consideration and shall be adjusted following the Closing
as set forth herein. The amount to be paid to each holder of Company Capital
Stock for each share of Company Capital Stock held shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole cent.



(iii) All shares of Company Capital Stock, when canceled, extinguished and
converted pursuant to Section 2.01(a), shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired, and each former holder of Company
Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the consideration provided for in Section 2.01(a).

(iv) At the Effective Time, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds the following:

(A) on behalf of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (1) all
Indebtedness as set forth on the Repaid Indebtedness Schedule ("Repaid
Indebtedness"), and (2) all Company Transaction Expenses as set forth on the
Transaction Expenses Schedule;

(B) on behalf of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to the appropriate
accounts of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries for remittance to (1) each
of the Option Holders, the Option Payments specified in Section 2.03, to be
paid to such Option Holder at or immediately following the Effective Time, as
reduced for required withholdings, and (2) the Internal Revenue Service or
other appropriate Governmental Authority (x) all amounts withheld from the
payments under clause (1) of this Section 2.01(a)(iv)(B) and (y) the
employer's portion of any payroll Taxes with respect to the payments under
clause (1) of this Section 2.01(a)(iv)(B);

(C) the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of Section
2.08; and

(D) the Initial Merger Consideration to the Representative pursuant to, and
reduced by the amounts set forth in, the terms of Section 2.02(a).

(b) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one share of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Each share certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any
such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of the
Surviving Corporation.

(c) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Any Company Capital Stock that is owned by
the Company and not issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

Section 2.02 Mechanism of Payment and Delivery of Certificates.

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deliver, or Parent or
Merger Sub shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause to be delivered,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the Representative for the
benefit of the Company Shareholders, cash in an aggregate amount equal to the
Initial Merger Consideration (minus (i) any amounts that would be



payable in respect of Dissenting Shares, (ii) any amounts that would be
payable in respect of the Options pursuant to Section 2.03 and (iii) the
Escrow Amount payable pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(iv)(C)) (the "Payment
Fund"), which deposit shall be held by the Representative in a segregated bank
account and used solely and exclusively for purposes of paying the
consideration specified in Section 2.01(a)(iv)(D) and for covering and
reimbursing the expenses and other obligations of the Representative as set
forth in Section 10.11. The Representative shall make the payments provided
for in Section 2.01(a)(iv)(D) of this Agreement out of the Payment Fund.

(b) Upon surrender to the Representative of a certificate representing,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Company Capital Stock (each, a
"Certificate"), together with a Letter of Transmittal duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive, within five (5) Business Days after
such surrender, in exchange therefor, cash in an amount set forth in the
Distribution Waterfall, which amounts shall be paid by the Representative by
check or wire transfer in accordance with the instructions provided by such
holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount to be paid to any obligor on
a Management Note in respect of the Company Capital Stock held by such obligor
shall be reduced by the principal amount of such Management Note plus accrued
interest thereon to the Effective Time, and such Management Note shall be
deemed cancelled thereafter. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued
on the consideration payable upon the surrender or transfer of any
Certificate. If the consideration provided for herein is to be delivered in
the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate was
surrendered, it shall be a condition of such delivery that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.02(b), each Certificate (other than those representing Dissenting Shares or
Company Capital Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(c)) shall
represent, for all purposes, only the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the portion of the Initial Merger Consideration (in the case of any obligor
under a Management Note, net of the principal amount of such Management Note
plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon at the Effective Time) payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.01(a) in respect of the Company Capital
Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.
The Representative shall promptly deliver to Parent all original Letters of
Transmittal delivered to the Representative after the Closing.

(c) Neither Parent nor any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of
Certificates or any other person in respect of any cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered or transferred by the
six-year anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any Merger Consideration, dividends (whether in cash, stock or
property) or other distributions with respect to Company Capital Stock in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any foreign, federal, state or local government or governmental agency),
then the Representative shall surrender such remaining cash amount to Parent.
After the end of such period, to the extent the Representative has surrendered
such remaining cash amount to Parent, any Company Shareholder who has not
delivered or surrendered such Company Shareholder's Certificate to the
Representative, subject to applicable Law, shall look as a general creditor
only to Parent for payment of such Company Shareholder's right to receive a
portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01.



(d) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of loss and indemnity (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Representative and Parent) of that fact
by the Person (who shall be the record owner of such Certificate) claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Representative shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Representative and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, withholding obligations of the
Company arising from the cancellation and settlement of any Options vested
pursuant to Section 2.03). To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Representative or the Escrow
Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

Section 2.03 Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, a committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take
all other actions necessary to (i) provide for the cancellation, effective as
of the Effective Time, of all outstanding stock options, stock appreciation
rights, warrants or similar rights to acquire Company Capital Stock heretofore
granted under the Company Incentive Plans, or granted pursuant to individual
option agreements, stock appreciation rights agreements, warrant agreements or
similar agreements outside of the Company Incentive Plans (each, an "Option"),
without any payment therefor except as otherwise provided in this Section
2.03, (ii) terminate the Company Incentive Plans and all individual option
agreements, stock appreciation rights agreements, warrant agreements or
similar agreements outside of the Company Incentive Plans as of the Effective
Time, (iii) fully vest each Option designated as a Time Vesting Option
pursuant to the relevant agreement evidencing the award of such Option and
(iv) to the extent any Performance Vesting Option is outstanding under any
Company Incentive Plan, amend such Company Incentive Plans to provide that any
Option designated as a Performance Vesting Option pursuant to any option
agreement thereunder shall be forfeited (collectively, the "Option Plan
Amendment"). Each vested Option, whether vested pursuant to its terms or
vested by appropriate resolutions of the Company Board (or, if appropriate, a
committee thereof), in its sole and absolute discretion pursuant to this
Section 2.03 or otherwise, to the extent unexercised as of the Effective Time,
shall thereafter no longer be exercisable but shall entitle each holder
thereof (each, an "Option Holder" and, together with the Company Shareholders,
the "Holders"), in cancellation and settlement therefor, to receive a portion
of the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall
(such payment to be net of withholding taxes, if any, and the Option Holder's
Percentage Interest of the Escrow Amount and the Representative Expense Fund,
and without interest), at the same time, in the same manner and subject to the
same conditions under which other Company Shareholders receive the Merger
Consideration (the "Option Payments"). Each unvested Option that does not vest
at the Effective Time pursuant to its



terms or this Section 2.03 shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time for no
consideration therefor.

Section 2.04 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The portion
of the Merger Consideration paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Capital Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of Company Capital Stock that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Section 2.07 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Determination of Closing Adjustment. No later than one (1) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with its
reasonably detailed good faith estimate of each of the Closing Cash (the
"Estimated Closing Cash") and Working Capital (the "Estimated Working
Capital") as of 11:59 pm Pacific time on the day prior to the Closing Date and
the amount, if any, by which the Initial Merger Consideration is to be
adjusted in accordance with its definition herein.

(b) Determination of Post-Closing Adjustment. As promptly as practicable, but
in any event within forty-five (45) days following the Closing, Parent shall
deliver to the Representative a reasonably detailed good faith calculation of
each of the actual Closing Cash (the "Actual Closing Cash") and the actual
Working Capital (the "Actual Working Capital") (prepared in accordance with
the definition of Working Capital herein and the "Working Capital Schedule"
attached hereto as Exhibit A), in each case as of 11:59 pm Pacific time on the
day prior to the Closing Date. After delivery of each of the Actual Closing
Cash and the Actual Working Capital by Parent to the Representative hereunder
(including, without limitation, during the period of any dispute hereunder
with respect to the Actual Closing Cash and/or the Actual Working Capital),
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries to, (i) reasonably assist the Representative and its
representatives in their review of the Actual Closing Cash and/or the Actual
Working Capital, as applicable, and the calculations set forth thereon and
provide the Representative and its representatives reasonable access during
reasonable business hours to the books, workpapers (including the workpapers
of Parent's and/or the Surviving Corporation's accountants) and other records
(including schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data,
facilities, accountants and employees of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Company Subsidiaries solely for purposes of their review of the Actual
Closing Cash and/or the Actual Working Capital, as applicable, and the
calculations set forth thereon, and (ii) reasonably cooperate with the
Representative and its representatives in connection with such review,
including by providing on a timely basis all other information that the
Representative (in good faith) believes is necessary and/or useful in
connection with their review of the Actual Closing Cash and/or the Actual

(c) Disputed Final Adjustment.



(i) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within forty-five (45) days
following the delivery by Parent of the calculation of Actual Closing Cash and
Actual Working Capital, the Representative shall notify Parent in writing
whether it accepts or disputes the accuracy of the calculation of Actual
Closing Cash or Actual Working Capital. If the Representative accepts the
calculation of Actual Closing Cash and Actual Working Capital determined
pursuant to Section 2.07(b) or does not dispute the calculation of Actual
Closing Cash or Actual Working Capital, as applicable, within such forty-five
(45) day period, then the calculation of Actual Closing Cash determined
pursuant to Section 2.07(b) shall be the "Final Closing Cash" and Actual
Working Capital determined pursuant to Section 2.07(b) shall be the "Final
Working Capital" and, as applicable, shall be deemed final and conclusive and
binding upon all parties in all respects.

(ii) If the Representative chooses to dispute the accuracy of the calculation
of Actual Closing Cash or Actual Working Capital, as applicable, the
Representative shall provide written notice to Parent no later than forty-five
(45) days following the delivery by Parent to the Representative of the
calculation of Actual Closing Cash or Actual Working Capital, as applicable
(the "Dispute Notice"), setting forth in reasonable detail those items that
the Representative disputes. During the thirty (30) day period following
delivery of a Dispute Notice, Parent and the Representative shall discuss such
disputes in good faith with a view to resolving their disagreements over the
disputed items (and all such discussions related thereto shall, unless
otherwise agreed by Parent and the Representative, be governed by Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence (and any applicable similar state rule)). If the
parties resolve their differences over the disputed items in accordance with
the foregoing procedure, "Final Closing Cash" or "Final Working Capital", as
applicable, shall be the amount agreed upon by them. If the parties fail to
resolve their differences over the disputed items within such thirty (30) day
period, Parent and the Representative shall forthwith jointly request that
KPMG LLP (the "Accounting Arbitrator") make a binding determination as to the
disputed items in accordance with this Agreement.

(iii) The Accounting Arbitrator shall under the terms of its engagement have
no more than thirty (30) days from the date of referral and no more than ten
(10) Business Days from the final submission of information and testimony by
Parent and the Representative within which to render its written decision with
respect to the disputed items (and only with respect to any unresolved
disputed items set forth in the Dispute Notice), and the final calculation of
Actual Closing Cash or Actual Working Capital, as applicable, shall be based
solely on the resolution of such disputed items by the Accounting Arbitrator.
The Accounting Arbitrator shall review such submissions and base its
determination solely on such submissions. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Arbitrator may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the least
value for such item claimed by either party. The decision of the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be deemed final and binding upon the parties and enforceable
by any court of competent jurisdiction and the Accounting Arbitrator's final
calculation of Actual Closing Cash shall be deemed the "Final Closing Cash" or
Actual Working Capital shall be deemed the "Final Working Capital", as
applicable. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
allocated to be paid by Parent, on the one hand, and the



Holders, on the other, based upon the percentage that the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party, as determined by the Accounting Arbitrator.

(d) Payment Following Calculation of Closing Cash and Working Capital.

(i) If the sum of Final Closing Cash and Final Working Capital is less than
the sum of Estimated Closing Cash and Estimated Working Capital, then such
difference shall be paid by the Representative to Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after such
determination. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any payment
is due from the Representative to Parent pursuant to this Section 2.07(d)(i),
then the obligation to pay such amount shall be satisfied (A) first, from the
funds in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and (B) second, from the
then remaining balance of funds held in the Indemnification Escrow Account.

(ii) If the sum of Final Closing Cash and Final Working Capital is greater
than the sum of Estimated Closing Cash and Estimated Working Capital, then
such difference shall be paid by Parent to the Representative by wire transfer
of immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after such
determination for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the Distribution
Waterfall.

(iii) After the payment from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account of
amounts, if any, under Section 2.07(d)(i), any amounts remaining in the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account shall be paid to the Representative
by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days
after such determination for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the
Distribution Waterfall.

(e) The parties hereto agree that, from and after the Closing, the provisions
of this Section 2.07 and the arbitration and the arbitration provisions
contemplated hereby shall be the exclusive remedy and exclusive forum of the
parties with respect to the determination of matters that are or that may be
addressed through the purchase price adjustment contemplated hereby.

Section 2.08 Escrow. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (a) into an
account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the "Indemnification
Escrow Account"), the Indemnification Escrow Amount out of the Initial Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to the Holders and otherwise available to fund
the Bonus Plan for the purpose of securing the obligations of the Holders set
forth in Article X of this Agreement and (b) into an account established

Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the Holders for the purpose of
securing the obligations of the Holders set forth in Section 2.07 and Article
X of this Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent under
the Escrow Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The portion of the Escrow
Amount contributed on behalf of each Holder shall be made in accordance with
the Distribution Waterfall, and the amount payable to such Holder pursuant to
Section 2.02 and/or Section 2.03 shall be reduced by such amount. Any amounts
released from the



Indemnification Escrow Account shall be payable as follows: (i) sixty-six
percent (66%) to the Representative so that it shall be released for the
account of each Holder, in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall, and
(ii) thirty-four percent (34%) to the Representative for the benefit of the
participants in the Bonus Plan, in accordance with the respective percentages
of each participant as set forth on Exhibit A to the Bonus Plan. Any amounts
released from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account for the benefit of

Subsidiaries (each a "Covered Person") against any actual costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities of any nature whatsoever, incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing (including, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest extent that the
Company or such Company Subsidiary, as applicable, would have been permitted

could reasonably be expected to adversely affect such exculpation or
indemnification obligation (unless required by law), it being the intent of
the parties that the Covered Persons shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification to the full extent of the law.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain a fully-paid up extended
reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage covering the Covered Persons who are
presently covered by the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' officers' and
directors' liability insurance policies with respect to



actions and omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Representative that shall provide such Covered
Persons for six (6) years following the Closing with coverage no less
extensive than the existing directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and having
other terms no less favorable to the Covered Persons covered thereby than the
existing coverage.

(d) In the event that after the Closing Date, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, or their respective successors or assigns, transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the

Section 6.02.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.02 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person.

consummate the transactions contemplated herein, in each case as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof.

Affiliates, representatives, agents and other advisors not to, contact and/or
communicate with any employee, officer, director, customer, supplier or other
material business relation of the Company and/or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise with respect to matters pertaining to the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective businesses, except with
the prior written consent of the Company.

Section 6.05 Confidentiality. Parent acknowledges that it and its
representatives and advisors remain bound by the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of September 14, 2012 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between
Parent and the Company in accordance with its terms.

Section 6.06 WARN Act Notice. For a period of 90 days after the Closing Date,
Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of the
Company Subsidiaries not to, take any action as would trigger any liability
under the WARN Act or any similar Laws. Parent shall be solely responsible for
providing any notice or other filing required under the WARN Act or any
similar Laws in respect of the termination after the Closing of the employment
of any employee of the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, and shall indemnify and hold the Holders harmless from any
liability arising from any failure of Parent to comply fully with this Section

(a) Parent acknowledges and agrees that it has conducted an independent
investigation of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. PARENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY IN THIS AGREEMENT AND BY THE HOLDERS IN THE

WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND THE HOLDERS TO PARENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND PARENT UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND

EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE
OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PROJECTIONS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,
ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY OR THE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES) ARE
SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY THE COMPANY AND THE HOLDERS. Except in the event of
fraud, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Holders make or
provide, and Parent hereby waives, any warranty or representation, express or
implied, as to the quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
conformity to samples, or condition of the Company's or the Company
Subsidiaries' assets or any part thereto. Except in the event of fraud, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that no claim shall be brought or maintained by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or Parent or their respective successors or
permitted assigns against any officer, partner, director or employee (present
or former) of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Holders or any direct
or indirect equityholder of any of the Holders, and no recourse shall be
brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and/or the
Holders set forth or contained in, this Agreement or any certificate delivered
hereunder, except against the Holders to the extent provided in Article X
hereof.

(b) In connection with Parent's investigation of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, Parent acknowledges and agrees that it has received from or on
behalf of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries certain estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans. Parent



acknowledges and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Parent is
familiar with such uncertainties, that Parent is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, plans and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
plans and forecasts), and that Parent shall have no claim against the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries, the Holders or any direct or indirect equityholder
of any of the Holders with respect thereto. Accordingly, Parent acknowledges
and agrees that none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Holders
make any representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
plans and forecasts). Parent agrees that none of the Holders nor any other
Person will have or be subject to any liability to Parent or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to Parent, or Parent's use of, any information
regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses, including any offering memoranda, accounting reports or similar
documents prepared by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and/or any of
their respective advisors and any information, document or material made
available to Parent or its Affiliates in certain "data rooms," management
presentations, discussions with management or any other form in expectation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.02 Tax Matters.

(a) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.

(i) Parent shall, at its sole cost and expense, timely prepare or cause to be
timely prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are due after the Closing Date
(the "Parent Prepared Returns") and, subject to rights to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement for Indemnified Taxes, shall timely pay or cause to
be timely paid all Taxes shown as due thereon. To the extent that a Parent
Prepared Return relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, such
Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures
and practices and accounting methods of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the extent such existing procedures and practices and
accounting methods are in accordance with applicable Law and, to the extent
applicable, the conventions provided in Section 7.02(a)(iii). At least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date of any Parent Prepared Return that relates to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, Parent shall submit a draft of
such Tax Return to the Representative for its review and comment. Parent shall
cause the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
incorporate any comments made by the Representative in the Tax Return actually
filed to the extent that such comments are reasonable and not inconsistent
with existing procedures and practices and accounting methods of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and are in accordance with applicable Law.

(ii) Except as necessary to comply with Section 7.02(f), Parent shall not, and
shall not allow Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary, to amend any
Tax Return of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or



Straddle Period or otherwise initiate (or otherwise participate in) any other
Holder Approved Tax Matter without the prior written permission of the
Representative; provided, however, that Parent may amend any Tax Return of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period or otherwise initiate (or otherwise participate in) any other Holder
Approved Tax Matter without the prior written consent of the Representative
and if any such action that was not approved by the Representative results in
any Indemnified Taxes to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for which
the Holders otherwise would be required to indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Section 10.02, the Holders will not be required to
indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for such Indemnified Taxes resulting
from such action.

(iii) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Representative agree with
respect to certain Tax matters as follows:

(A) To treat (and have the Company and each Company Subsidiary treat) any
Transaction Deductions paid or accrued on or before the Closing as deductible
in a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date) and no party hereto shall apply (or allow the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to apply) the "next day rule" under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to such deductions.

(B) To make (and have the Company and, as necessary, each Company Subsidiary
make) an election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to deduct seventy percent
(70%) of any Transaction Deductions (including the fees of Piper Jaffray and Co.
and Wells Fargo) that are success-based fees as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.263(a)-5(f).

(C) To treat (and have the Company and each Company Subsidiary treat) any
gains, income, deductions, losses, or other items realized by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary resulting from any Parent Closing Date Transaction as
occurring on the day after the Closing Date and to utilize (and cause the
Company and each Company Subsidiary to utilize) the "next day rule" in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision
of state, local, or non-U.S. Law) for purposes of reporting such items on
applicable Tax Returns.

(D) That no election shall be made by any party (or the Company or any Company
Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2) (or any similar
provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Law) to ratably allocate items incurred
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(E) That no election under Code Section 338(g) shall be made with respect to
the acquisition of the shares of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
contemplated by this Agreement.



(F) To treat all interest and other earnings on the Escrow Accounts as income
of Parent in accordance with the transition rule set forth in Proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8(h)(2).

(G) That no election shall be made to waive the carry back of any net
operating loss or other Tax attribute or credit realized in a Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

(H) To treat any indemnification payments as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration to the extent permitted under applicable Law.

Unless otherwise required by a determination of a Governmental Authority that
is final, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall file a Tax Return
(and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not allow the Company
Subsidiaries to file a Tax Return) that is inconsistent with any agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.02(a)(iii), and neither Parent nor the Company
Subsidiaries shall take any position (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not allow the Company Subsidiaries to take any position) during the
course of any Tax Contest or other audit or proceedings that is inconsistent
with any agreement pursuant to this Section 7.02(a)(iii).

(b) Straddle Period Tax Returns. To the extent permissible under applicable
Laws, the parties agree to elect (and have the Company and each Company
Subsidiary elect) to have each Tax year of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries end on the Closing Date and, if such election is not permitted or
required in a jurisdiction such that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
are required to file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, the parties agree to
use the following conventions for determining the amount of Taxes attributable
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date: (i) in the
case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a periodic basis,
the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period; and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes, sales
Taxes, employment Taxes, withholding Taxes), the amount attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
as if the Company and the Company Subsidiaries filed a separate Tax Return
with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on as
of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books
methodology." For purposes of clause (ii), any item determined on an annual or
periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions) shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
based on the relative number of days in such portion of the Straddle Period as
compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

(c) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Representative and Parent shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries) to
(i) assist in the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries; (ii) assist in any audit or other
proceeding with respect to the Tax Returns or Taxes of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries; (iii) make available any information, records, or other
documents relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; (iv) provide any information required to allow the
Representative, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any



Subsidiaries to comply with any information reporting contained in the Code or
other applicable Laws; and (v) provide certificates or forms, and timely
execute any Tax Return, to the extent in compliance with applicable Law, that
are necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in)
any Transfer Tax.

(d) Transfer Taxes. Parent will pay, and will indemnify and hold the Holders
harmless against, any documentary, stamp, stock transfer, or similar Tax
imposed on the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or one or more Holders as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any related
penalties or interest (collectively, "Transfer Taxes").

(e) Tax Contests.

(i) If any Governmental Authority issues to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (1) a notice of its intent to audit or conduct another proceeding
with respect to a Tax Return or Taxes of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or (2) a notice
of deficiency for Taxes for any such period, Parent shall notify the
Representative of its receipt of such communication from the Governmental
Authority within ten (10) days of receipt and provide the Representative with
copies of all correspondence and other documents received from the
Governmental Authority. The Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall control any audit or other proceeding in
respect of any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (a "Tax Contest"); provided, however, (1) the Representative, at
the Holders' sole cost and expense, shall have the right to participate in any
Tax Contest to the extent it relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and
participate in any Tax Contest to the extent it relates to a Straddle Period,
but only if the Holders have an indemnification obligation to any Parent
Indemnified Party for the Taxes that are the subject of such Tax Contest; and
(2) Parent shall not, and shall not allow the Surviving Corporation and the
Company Subsidiaries, to settle, resolve, or abandon a Tax Contest (whether or
not the Representative participates or controls in such Tax Contest) for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, to the extent that the Holders have
an indemnification obligation to any Parent Indemnified Party for the Taxes
that are the subject of such Tax Contest without the prior written permission
of the Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned).

(ii) If the Representative elects to participate in a Tax Contest for which
the Holders have an indemnification obligation to any Parent Indemnified Party
for the Taxes that are the subject of such Tax Contest as provided in Section
7.02(e)(i), (1) the Representative shall notify Parent of such intent; (2)
Parent shall control, or cause the Surviving Corporation or the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to control, such Tax Contest diligently and in
good faith; (3) Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
the Company Subsidiaries to) promptly take all actions necessary to allow the
Representative (and its counsel) to fully participate in such Tax Contest; and
(4) if requested by the Representative, Parent shall settle (or cause the
Surviving Corporation or the applicable Company Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to settle) the Tax Contest on terms acceptable to the Governmental Authority
and the Representative (provided that such



settlement will not result in a Parent Indemnified Party incurring any Tax
that the Holders are not required to pay or indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Parties for under this Agreement).

(iii) If the Representative elects to participate in such Tax Contest, its
right to participate shall include the following: (a) being consulted with on
an ongoing and timely basis by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and any
Company Subsidiary and any of their advisors regarding the conduct (and
potential settlement) of such Tax Contest; (b) having reasonable access to
books and records and personnel of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and any
Company Subsidiary and any of their advisors that are relevant to such Tax
Contest; (c) timely receiving from Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Company Subsidiary or any of their advisors all correspondence, other
documents and settlement offers received by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any Company Subsidiary or any of their advisors from any Governmental
Authority that are relevant to such Tax Contest; (d) approving any settlement
offers to be made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Company
Subsidiary or any of their advisors to any Governmental Authority with respect
to such Tax Contest; (e) to the extent not prepared by or on behalf of the
Representative, receiving on a timely basis all drafts of correspondence,
submissions and other documents or other written material prepared by, or
compiled on behalf of, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Company
Subsidiary or any of their advisors that are intended to be provided to any
Governmental Authority with respect to such Tax Contest; (f) having all of its
reasonable comments to any drafts of any correspondence, submissions or other
documents or written material to be provided to any Governmental Authority
with respect to such Tax Contest incorporated and approving the final form of
any such correspondence, submission, document or other written material; (g)
receiving from Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary or
any of their advisors timely notice of any conferences, meetings or calls with
any Governmental Authority that are with respect to such Tax Contest; (h)
being consulted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and any Company
Subsidiary and any of their advisors prior to any conferences or meetings or
calls with any Governmental Authority as to the proper conduct of such
meetings; and (i) having the right to attend, and participate in, any
conferences, meetings or calls with any Governmental Authority regarding such
Tax Contest. If the Representative elects to participate in such Tax Contest,
it shall be entitled to retain counsel or other advisors of its own selection
(at its expense) to represent its interest and to receive, review, comment on
and approve any correspondence, submission, document or other written material
on the Representative's behalf and to attend and participate in, on the
Representative's behalf, any meetings, calls or conferences with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary or any of their advisors or
with any Governmental Authority which, in each case, relate to such Tax
Contest.

(iv) If the Representative does not participate in a Tax Contest (whether by
election or otherwise) that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period for which the Holders have an indemnification obligation to the Parent
Indemnified Parties for the Taxes that are the subject of such Tax Contest,
(1) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to control such Tax Contest



diligently and in good faith; (2) Parent shall keep the Representative
reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest; and (3) if
requested by the Representative, Parent shall settle (or cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to settle) the Tax
Contest on terms acceptable to the applicable Governmental Authority and the
Representative (provided that such settlement will not result in any Parent
Indemnified Party incurring any Taxes that the Holders are not required to pay
or indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for under this Agreement).

(f) Tax Refunds.

(i) All refunds of Taxes (other than refunds of Transfer Taxes) of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as determined in accordance with
the same principles provided for in Section 7.02(b)) (whether in the form of
cash received or a credit or offset against Taxes otherwise payable) shall be
the property of the Holders to the extent such refund was not included as an
asset in the computation of the Final Working Capital. To the extent that
Parent, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries receive a refund that is the
property of the Holders, Parent shall pay the amount of such refund (and
interest received from the Governmental Authority), reduced by any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent, the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries with respect to the receipt of such Tax refund, to the
Representative for distribution to the Holders in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. The amount due to the Holders shall be payable to the
Representative ten (10) days after receipt of the refund from the applicable
Governmental Authority (or, if the refund is in the form of credit or offset,
ten (10) days after the due date of the Tax Return claiming such credit or
offset).

(ii) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts and take such other
efforts reasonably requested by Parent to claim (and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable
efforts and take such other efforts reasonably requested by Parent to claim)
any refunds that will give rise to a payment to, or on behalf of, the Holders
under Section 7.02(f). Such actions shall include, as promptly as possible
following the Closing Date (but in no event with respect to filing IRS Form
4466 for 2012, longer than fifteen (15) days following the Closing Date),
filing an IRS Form 1139 (and any comparable form for state or local Tax
purposes) to claim a refund from the carrying back of a net operating loss for
the year ended on the Closing Date and/or an IRS Form 4466 (and comparable
form for state or local Tax purposes) claiming refund for the overpayment of
estimated Taxes. Parent shall provide the Representative with copies of all
Tax Returns filed that show refunds that could give rise to a payment
hereunder (including any IRS Form 1139 or IRS Form 4466) promptly after
filing.

Section 7.03 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by
any party hereto and at such requesting party's expense, any other party
hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all
such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary
or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions



contemplated by this Agreement on and subject to the terms and conditions
hereof. To the extent such assistance and cooperation is necessary, the
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts (at the sole cost and
expense of Parent) to assist and cooperate with Parent in obtaining the
consent of the pre-Closing auditors of the Company to inclusion of their
report on the pre-Closing financial statements in any SEC filing of Parent
that requires the inclusion of any such pre-Closing financial statements and
such consent. Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, the
Representative shall deliver to Parent a data CD containing all materials
included in the Project Identity virtual data room.

Section 7.04 Regulatory Compliance. Parent and the Company have caused to be
made the filings required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "HSR Filings"). Parent has
paid the filing fee in connection with the HSR Filings. The parties hereto
agree to comply at the earliest practicable date with any formal or informal
request for additional information or documentary material received from the
Antitrust Authorities in connection with the HSR Filings, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereto further agree to
cooperate with each other in order to resolve any investigation or other
inquiry initiated by the Antitrust Authorities concerning the HSR Filings,
provided, however, Parent is not required to agree to any dispositions of, or
restrictions on the use of, assets or any restrictions on the operations of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) in order to resolve any investigation or inquiry. The parties
hereto agree to promptly inform each other party of any material communication
made to or received from the Antitrust Authorities.

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION



Section 9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing only as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) by Parent, if there has been a material breach by the Company of any
covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has
prevented the satisfaction of any condition in Section 8.01 to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub at the Closing and such breach has not been waived by
Parent or cured by the Company within ten (10) days after the Company's
receipt of written notice thereof from Parent;

(c) by the Company, if there has been a material breach by Parent or Merger
Sub of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition in Section 8.02 to the
obligations of the Company at the Closing and such breach has not been waived
by the Company or cured by Parent or Merger Sub within ten (10) days after
Parent's receipt of written notice thereof from the Company (provided that the
failure of Parent to deliver the payments and other consideration pursuant to
Sections 2.01(a), 2.02 and 2.03 at the Closing as required hereunder shall not
be subject to cure hereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Company);

(d) by Parent if the Closing has not occurred on or before December 31, 2012;
provided that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.01(d) if Parent's or Merger Sub's breach of this
Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; or

(e) by the Company if the Closing has not occurred on or before December 31,
2012; provided that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(e) if the Company's breach of this
Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses (b), (c),
(d) or (e) of this Section 9.01 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other parties hereto.

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.01 above,
the provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void and of no
further force and effect (other than this Section 9.02, Section 6.04 (Contact
with Customers, Suppliers, Etc.) and Article XII (Miscellaneous) and the
Confidentiality Agreement, each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of either Parent or
the Company to one another, except for willful breaches of this Agreement
prior to the time of such termination and, in the case of Parent, any failure
to have sufficiently available funds for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any failure to deliver the payments and other
consideration pursuant to Sections 2.01(a), 2.02 and 2.03 at the Closing as
required hereunder. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if

ARTICLE X 
INDEMNIFICATION

Section 10.01 Survival Period. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Representative set forth
in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Survival Period") and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect.

Section 10.02 Indemnification by the Holders for the Benefit of Parent and
Merger Sub.

(a) Subject to the applicable provisions and limitations of this Article X,
after the Closing, the Holders shall indemnify Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, their Affiliates and each of their respective
directors, managers, members, equityholders, officers, partners, employees,
lenders, representatives, agents, successors and permitted assigns (the
"Parent Indemnified Parties"), from and against any Loss that any Parent
Indemnified Party suffers or sustains, in connection with, arising out of or
resulting from, directly or indirectly: (i) any breach by the Company of any
representation and warranty of the Company contained in Article III of this
Agreement; (ii) any breach by the Company prior to the Closing of any covenant
or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by the Company prior to the Closing (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any breaches by the Company of covenants or agreements of
the Company herein from and after the Closing); (iii) any Indemnified Taxes;
(iv) any Indebtedness not set forth on the Repaid Indebtedness Schedule; (v)
any Company Transaction Expenses not paid at or prior to the Closing; (vi) any
unvested Options not cancelled as of the Effective Time in accordance with
Section 2.03; (vii) any Losses with respect to any Dissenting Shares to the
extent such Losses are in excess of such Dissenting Shares' share of the
Merger Consideration; (viii) the calculation of the Distribution Waterfall
(including payments of amounts thereunder to Holders); (ix) the Serialized
Barcode Blood Bands and the Serialized Conf-ID-ent Mother-Father-Baby Bands
products purchased by the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the
Closing, including, without limitation, the occurrences specified on Section
3.26 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and any similar occurrences; and (x)
any severance or change of control payments or benefits provided to the
Covered Employee pursuant to that certain letter agreement, dated February 14,
2003, as amended on July 24, 2009, between the Covered Employee and the
Company in excess of the amount specified under Section 6(a) thereof, as
amended. The rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties to indemnification under
Section 10.02(a)(ii)-(ix) shall apply notwithstanding that the matter in
question may be disclosed in a Company Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement
or in any Transaction Document or may be otherwise known by Parent or any of
its Affiliates, or may be the subject of, excluded from or beyond the scope of
any representation or warranty of the Company.



(b) Except in the event of fraud, any amount determined to be owed by the
Holders pursuant to this Article X shall be satisfied solely from any then
remaining balance in the Indemnification Escrow Account; provided, however,
any amount determined to be owed by the Holders pursuant to Section
10.02(a)(viii) shall be satisfied (i) first, from the then remaining balance
of funds held in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and (ii) second,
from the then remaining balance of funds held in the Indemnification Escrow
Account.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other applicable limitations on indemnification recovery set
forth in this Article X), except in the event of fraud, the Holders shall have
no liability under Section 10.02(a)(i), unless the aggregate amount of all
Losses relating thereto for which the Holders would be liable, but for this
Section 10.02(c), exceeds on a cumulative basis $2,000,000 (the "Threshold";
if the Threshold is exceeded, all Losses (including the first $2,000,000 of
such Losses) shall be recoverable); provided, however, the Threshold shall not
apply to Losses in connection with, arising out of or resulting from, directly
or indirectly, any breach of a Special Representation (i.e., except as a
result of the Cap or other limitations under this Article X, all Losses
arising from a breach of a Special Representation shall be recoverable);
provided, further, that except in the event of fraud, the Holders' aggregate
liability under this Section 10.02 shall in no event exceed the balance of the
funds in the Indemnification Escrow Account (the "Cap"); and provided further
that no claim for indemnification by the Parent Indemnified Parties under this
Section 10.02 may be asserted with respect to any individual Loss where the
amount that would otherwise be payable by the Holders hereunder relating to
such claim with respect to any such individual Loss is less than $20,000 (the
"Mini-Basket"), and if such claim does not exceed such amount of the Mini-
Basket, the amount of such claim shall not be taken into account in
determining whether or not or to the extent to which the Threshold has been
reached or exceeded; provided, however, the Mini-Basket shall not apply to
Losses in connection with, arising out of or resulting from, directly or
indirectly, any breach of a Special Representation. The limitations of this
Section 10.02(c) shall apply mutatis mutandis to indemnification under Section
10.04 (including a Cap of $8,500,000).

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Holders shall be liable to, or have any obligation to indemnify,
any Parent Indemnified Party for any Losses (i) that are punitive, special,
consequential (other than reasonably foreseeable consequential damages),
incidental, exemplary, in the nature of lost profits or the like, in the
nature of multiple of earnings or EBITDA or the like or resulting from any
diminution in value of property or equity, in each case except to the extent
paid to third parties, and/or (ii) to the extent and in the amount that an
accrual for or reserve against any such Losses is included in the Final
Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.07). Parent
acknowledges and agrees that, except in the event of fraud, the
indemnification provided by Section 10.02(a) (subject to the applicable
provisions and limitations set forth in this Article X) constitutes the Parent
Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or other
claims relating to or arising from this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or any exhibit, schedule (including the
Company Disclosure Schedule) or certificate delivered hereunder or otherwise
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, with respect to any misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach
of, any representations or warranties or any breach or failure in performance
of any covenants or agreements made by the Company or the



Representative in this Agreement or in any exhibits or schedules hereto
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule) or any certificate delivered
hereunder or otherwise with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that this sentence shall not limit any rights Parent may have (1)
under Section 12.13 with respect to seeking specific performance or other
equitable relief or (2) under Article IX in connection with any termination of
this Agreement prior to the Closing.

Section 10.03 Related Matters. The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to recover any Losses relating to any matter arising under one
provision of this Agreement to the extent that the Parent Indemnified Parties
had already recovered Losses with respect to such matter pursuant to any other
provision of this Agreement.

Section 10.04 Indemnification by Parent for the Benefit of the Holders.
Subject to the applicable provisions of this Article X, after the Closing,
Parent shall indemnify each of the Holders and each of their respective
Affiliates and each of their respective directors, managers, members,
equityholders, officers, partners, employees, lenders, representatives,
agents, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Holder
Indemnified Parties") against any Losses which any of the Holder Indemnified
Parties suffers or sustains, in connection with, arising out of or resulting
from, directly or indirectly: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty
of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement and (b) any breach of any
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement to be performed by Parent or
Merger Sub and/or, from and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or
the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 10.05 Manner of Payment. Any indemnification payment pursuant to this
Article X shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds
from (or on behalf of) the applicable indemnifying party to an account
designated by each applicable indemnified party within twenty-one (21) days
after the determination thereof; provided, that, except as set forth in the
proviso to Section 10.02(b) and except in the event of fraud, any payment
obligations of the Holders pursuant to this Agreement shall be satisfied
solely from the Indemnification Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. Any payment obligations of the Holders pursuant to this
Agreement in the event of fraud shall first be satisfied from the
Indemnification Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
and then shall be satisfied directly from the perpetrator of such fraud with
respect to those amounts in excess of the amount remaining in the
Indemnification Escrow Account.

Section 10.06 Defense of Third Party Claims.

(a) Except for Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 7.02(e), promptly
after the assertion by any third party of any claim (a "Third Party Claim")
against any Person entitled to seek indemnification under Section 10.02(a) or
Section 10.04 (an "Indemnitee") that results or may result in the incurrence
by such Indemnitee of any Loss for which such Indemnitee desires to seek
indemnification under this Article X, such Indemnitee shall notify each of the
parties from whom such indemnification could be sought hereunder (such notice
to be provided to the Representative in the case of indemnification sought
from any of the Holders) with respect to such claim (collectively, the
"Indemnitor") of such claim in writing promptly after receiving notice of such



claim, describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable)
and the basis thereof in reasonable detail (such written notice, an
"Indemnification Notice"); provided that the failure to so notify an
Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that such failure shall have caused the Losses for which
the Indemnitor is obligated to be greater than such Losses would have been had
the Indemnitee given the Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder. Any Indemnitor
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitee's claim
for indemnification at such Indemnitor's expense. The Indemnitor, at its
option and expense, shall be entitled to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided,
that the Indemnitor shall not have the right to assume control of such defense
or to select counsel if the Third Party Claim which the Indemnitor seeks to
assume control of (x) seeks non-monetary relief, (y) involves criminal or
quasi-criminal allegations and/or (z) is initiated against a Parent
Indemnified Party and involves potential Losses in excess of the outstanding
unreserved amount held in the Indemnification Escrow Account. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense
of any such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;
provided, however, that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne
by the Indemnitee and shall not be recoverable from such Indemnitor(s) under
this Article X. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim,
the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claims; provided that the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee before
entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if (A)
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement, injunctive or other equitable
relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or (B) such settlement does not
expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim. The Representative shall act on behalf
of the Holders hereunder as "Indemnitor" or "Indemnitee" hereunder.

(b) In all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide, and the Indemnitee shall cause
its Affiliates to provide, their reasonable cooperation with the Indemnitor in
defense of claims or litigation, including by making employees, information
and documentation reasonably available. In no event shall an Indemnitee
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnitor (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned and/or delayed) if any
Indemnitee is seeking or shall seek indemnification hereunder with respect to
such matter; it being understood and agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that
any such consent of the Indemnitor to any such consent to the entry of
judgment or settlement shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgement that any Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder
with respect to any such Third Party Claim. With respect to any Tax matter,
the provisions of Section 7.02(e) shall control as opposed to the provisions
of this Section 10.6.

with respect to the Tax year of such Loss or either of the two (2) Tax years
immediately following such Tax year, and (b) any insurance proceeds or other
third party indemnification or reimbursement proceeds received by any



of them on account of such Loss (net of any expense incurred in connection
with obtaining such proceeds). If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective Affiliates realize a Tax
Benefit with respect to the Tax year of the Loss or either of the two (2)
immediately succeeding Tax years and such Tax Benefit was not included in the
computation of the Loss, Parent shall within ten (10) days after filing the
Tax Return claiming the Tax Benefit (or, to the extent the Tax Benefit is in

Holders the amount of such Tax Benefit. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable actions (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable actions) to timely claim any Tax
Benefit that shall reduce the amount of a Loss, or give rise to a payment to
or for the benefit of the Holders, under this Section 10.07. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation,
the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates to use commercially
reasonable efforts to, seek full recovery under all insurance policies and
other third-party agreements covering any Loss to the same extent as they
would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder; provided,
that such commercially reasonable efforts shall not include the commencement
of litigation. In the event that an insurance recovery or a recovery under any
other third-party agreement is made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to
any Loss for which any Parent Indemnified Party has been indemnified
hereunder, then a payment equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall
be made promptly by Parent to the Representative for the benefit of the
Holders pursuant to the Distribution Waterfall. The Holders shall be
subrogated to all rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries against their respective applicable insurers to the extent (but
only to the extent) of any Losses indemnified by the Holders.

Section 10.08 Expiration of Indemnification. No Person shall be liable for any
claim for indemnification under Section 10.02(a) or Section 10.04 unless
written notice (stating in reasonable detail the nature of, and factual and
legal basis for, any such claim for indemnification, and the provisions of
this Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is made) is delivered
by the Person seeking indemnification to the Person from whom indemnification
is sought prior to the expiration of the Survival Period, in which case the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which is the subject of such
claim shall survive, to the extent of such claim, until such claim is
resolved, whether or not the amount of the Losses resulting from such breach
has been finally determined at the time the notice is given.

Section 10.09 Limitation on Recourse. Except in the event of fraud, no claim
shall be brought or maintained by any Parent Indemnified Party or any of their
respective successors or permitted assigns against any present or former
officer, director, employee or Affiliate of any party hereto which is not
otherwise expressly identified as a party hereto, and no recourse shall be
brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties, agreements or covenants of any party hereto set forth or contained
in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule)



or any certificate delivered hereunder. After the consummation of the Closing,
no party may seek the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 10.10 Materiality Qualifiers. For purposes of determining (i) the
amount of Losses arising from such a breach for which the Parent Indemnified
Parties or Holder Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under
Sections 10.2(a) or 10.04 or (ii) whether the Threshold has been exceeded, all
qualifications contained in the representations and warranties of the Company
or Parent contained in this Agreement that are based on materiality
(including, without limitation, all usages of "material", "Material Adverse
Effect" or similar qualifiers) will be disregarded.

Section 10.11 Representative. The Representative has been approved by the
Company (and will be confirmed by the Holders who execute those certain
Letters of Transmittal, the "Letters of Transmittal," attached hereto as
Exhibits B-1 and B-2) to serve as the representative of the Holders with
respect to the matters expressly set forth in this Agreement to be performed
by the Representative. Each of the Holders shall irrevocably appoint the
Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney‑in‑fact for such Holder for
all purposes of this Agreement, including full power and authority on such
Holder's behalf to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which
such Holder is, or Holders collectively are, permitted or required to do or
exercise under this Agreement. At the Effective Time, the Representative shall
retain a portion of the Initial Merger Consideration paid by Parent, to be
determined by the Representative in its reasonable sole discretion, to be held
in trust to cover and reimburse the fees and expenses incurred by the
Representative for its obligations in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein (the "Representative Expense Fund"). Any
balance of the Representative Expense Fund not incurred for such purposes
shall be returned to the Holders pursuant to the Distribution Waterfall. After
the Closing, the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain executed Letters of Transmittal from any Holders who have not executed

Section 12.04 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their

their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, other than sections which
are specifically for the benefit of Parent Indemnified Parties, Holder

Section 12.05 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

Section 12.06 References. The table of contents and the section and other
headings and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto
are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the
parties hereto, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement or any exhibit hereto. All references to days or months
shall be deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$"
or "dollars" shall be deemed references to United States dollars. Any
reference in this Agreement to wire transfers or other payments requires
payment in dollars of the United States of America unless some other currency
is expressly stated in that reference. Unless the context otherwise requires,
any reference to a "Section," "Exhibit" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer
to a section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or schedule to this
Agreement, as applicable. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word
"including" shall mean "including without limitation".

Section 12.07 No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express
their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied
against any Person.

Section 12.08 Amendment and Waiver. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived only in a writing signed
by Parent, the Company and the Representative. No waiver of any provision
hereunder or any breach



or default thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or
prior or subsequent breach or default.

Section 12.09 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement among the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, which
may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

Section 12.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (including by means of telecopied or electronic pdf signature
pages), any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one
party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

Section 12.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.11.

Section 12.12 Company Disclosure Schedule. The disclosures on any Company
Disclosure Schedule will qualify any representation or warranty in this
Agreement only to the extent that the relevance or applicability of such
disclosures to such representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on its
face, notwithstanding that a particular representation or warranty may not
specifically make a reference or cross-reference to the Company Disclosure
Schedule. The inclusion of information in the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall not be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that a
violation, right of termination, default, liability or other obligation of any
kind exists with respect to any item, nor shall it be construed as or
constitute an admission or agreement that such information is material to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries. In addition, matters reflected in the
Company Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Neither the
specifications of any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no party shall



use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any
such item in any dispute or controversy among the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Company
Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement or
otherwise. Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended
to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not
in the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of setting
forth or the inclusion of any such items or matters in any dispute or
controversy involving any of the parties hereto as to whether any obligation,
item or matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure
Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this
Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have the right from time to
time to supplement, modify or update the Company Disclosure Schedule with
respect to facts arising after the date hereof to ensure the correctness
thereof and/or to disclose to Parent any exceptions to or variances from the
representations and warranties in Article III. Any such supplement,
modification or update shall not affect the obligations of Parent under
Section 8.01(a) hereof to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that for all other purposes hereunder, (x) the delivery of any such
supplement, modification or update shall be deemed to have cured any
misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty that otherwise might
have existed hereunder by reason of such exception or variance or
incorrectness and (y) the Company shall not be deemed to be in breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant hereunder with respect to the information
disclosed in any such supplement, modification or update. From and after the
Closing, references to the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be references to
the Company Disclosure Schedule as so supplemented, modified and/or updated.

Section 12.13 Specific Performance. The Company and the Representative agree
that Parent shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies
existing in its favor, to enforce its rights and the obligations of the
Company hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by an
action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable
relief. Furthermore, Parent agrees that the Company and the Representative
shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in
their favor, to enforce their rights and the obligations of Parent hereunder
not only by an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions
for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief.

Section 12.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a) All matters relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and
enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; provided, however, that all
matters relating to the Merger shall be governed and construed in accordance
with the domestic laws of the State of California without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether



of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in the State and Federal courts located
in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient form. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in Section 12.03 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

Section 12.15 Legal Representation; Related Matters. Parent and Merger Sub
agree that, following the Closing, Winston and Strawn LLP ("WandS") may serve as
counsel to the Representative, the Holders and their Affiliates in connection
with any matters related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding any representation by WandS prior to the Closing Date of the
Company and/or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company (on behalf of itself and the Company Subsidiaries) hereby (a) waive
any claim they have or may have that WandS has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and (b) agree that,
in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Parent, the
Company or any or its Subsidiaries and the Representative, the Holders or any
of their Affiliates, WandS may represent the Representative, the Holders and any
of their Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and even though WandS may have represented the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute.
Parent and the Company (on behalf of itself and the Company Subsidiaries) also
further agree that, as to all communications among WandS and the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, the Representative, the Holders, the Holders' Affiliates
and/or their respective representatives that relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Holders and may be
controlled by the Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and a third party other than a party to this
Agreement after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by WandS to such third party.

Section 12.16 Prevailing Party. If any litigation or other court action,
arbitration or similar adjudicatory proceeding is commenced by any party
hereto to enforce its rights under



this Agreement against any other party hereto, all out-of-pocket fees, costs
and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
court costs, incurred by the prevailing party in prosecuting or defending (as
applicable) such litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding shall be
reimbursed by the losing party; provided, that if a party to such litigation,
action, arbitration or proceeding prevails in part, and loses in part, the
court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such litigation, action,
arbitration or proceeding shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such party on an equitable basis.
