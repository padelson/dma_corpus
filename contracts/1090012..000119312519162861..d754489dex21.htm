Indemnification of Third Party Claims 

---|--- 
 

The following provisions shall be applicable to any and all Claims made by a
Third Party (a "Third Party Claim") against a Person that is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party"), and the
Party obligated to provide such indemnification shall be the "Indemnifying
Party".

 



     | (a) |

Upon a Third Party Claim being made or commenced against the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide written notice thereof to
the Indemnifying Party. The notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail and indicate the estimated amount, if practicable, of the
indemnified Losses and Liabilities that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party in respect thereof. If the Indemnified Party does not give
prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party as aforesaid, any such failure shall
only lessen or limit the Indemnified Partys rights to indemnity hereunder to
the extent that the settlement or defence of the Third Party Claim was
prejudiced by the lack of prompt notice. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges to the Indemnified Party in writing
that the Indemnifying Party is responsible to indemnify the Indemnified Party
in respect of the Third Party Claim pursuant hereto, the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right, on written notice to the Indemnified Party given not
later than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the notice described in
Section 5.4(a), to do either or both of the following: 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

assume carriage of the defence of the Third Party Claim using legal counsel of
its choice and at its sole cost; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

settle the Third Party Claim provided that the Indemnifying Party pays the
full monetary amount of the settlement and the settlement does not impose any
unreasonable restrictions or obligations on the Indemnified Party, except as
have been consented to in writing by the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

If the Indemnifying Party has: 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

failed to notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to assume carriage of
the defence of the Third Party Claim within the period of time described in
Section 5.4(b); 

---|---|--- 
 



-41- 

         | (ii) |

notified the Indemnified Party that it will not assume the defence of the
Third Party Claim; or  

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to assume carriage of the
defence of the Third Party Claim and failed to defend the Third Party Claim
with reasonable diligence; 

---|---|--- 

the Indemnified Party may, without derogating from its entitlement to the
indemnity hereunder, assume the defence of the Third Party Claim, in such
manner as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, and:



     | (A) |

may settle the Third Party Claim, in its discretion acting reasonably; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (B) |

the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any determination made in the Third
Party Claim or any settlement thereof effected by the Indemnified Party; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (C) |

the reasonable costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending the Third
Party Claim (including legal fees on a solicitor and client basis) will be
included in the Losses and Liabilities for which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

Each Party shall keep the other reasonably informed with respect to the
defence of the Third Party Claim and shall cooperate with the other in the
defence of the Third Party Claim, including making available to the other
Party, its directors, officers, employees and consultants whose assistance,
testimony or presence is of material assistance in evaluating and/or
defending the Third Party Claim. The Party not assuming carriage of the
defence of the Third Party Claim shall be entitled to participate in the
defence of such claim, with its own counsel and at its own expense but shall
not do anything that interferes with or causes harm to the conduct of the
defence of the Third Party Claim. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

Subject to Section 5.4(c)(A), the Indemnified Party shall not enter into any
settlement, consent order or other compromise with respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the
Indemnified Party waives its rights to indemnification in respect of the
Third Party Claim. 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

Upon payment of the amount due under the settlement, consent order, judgment,
or other compromise required to conclude the Third Party Claim, as
applicable, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all claims the
Indemnified Party may have relating thereto. The Indemnified Party shall give
such further assurances and cooperate with the Indemnifying Party to permit
the Indemnifying Party to pursue any and all such subrogated claims as
reasonably requested by it. 

---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

If the Indemnifying Party has paid the full amount required to be paid by it
in respect of a Third Party Claim pursuant to its indemnification obligations
herein and the Indemnified Party is subsequently reimbursed from any other
source in respect of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay the amount of the reimbursement (including interest actually
received) to the Indemnifying Party, net of Taxes required to be paid by the
Indemnified Party as a result of any such payment and plus any Taxes saved or
recovered by the Indemnified Party as a result of any such payment.

Purchaser shall advise DCC in writing of its _bona fide_ allocations of value
for DCCs interest in and to the Scheduled Assets which are subject to the
Identified ROFRs (the "ROFR Value"). DCC shall comply with the applicable
provisions of such ROFRs and shall courier notices to the ROFR Holders (and
Purchaser, if applicable) no later than two (2) Business Days after it
receives the ROFR Value allocations from Purchaser, in the form of a notice
letter substantially as set out in Schedule "H" using the ROFR Value
allocations of Purchaser. Unless otherwise agreed by Purchaser, each such
notice shall include a request for a waiver of any ROFR to purchase any of
the Scheduled Assets. DCC shall notify Purchaser in writing forthwith upon
each ROFR Holder exercising or waiving such a right. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

If a portion of the Scheduled Assets is excluded from the Closing because a
ROFR Holder has exercised its ROFR pursuant to Section 8.1(a): 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

the terms "Scheduled Assets", "Miscellaneous Interests", "Lands",
"Petroleum and Natural Gas Rights" and "Tangibles" shall be construed as
meaning only that portion of the subject matter of those terms with respect to
which Closing occurs and the Schedules shall be deemed to be revised to
reflect the deletion of such Scheduled Assets therefrom; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the Base Purchase Price of the Assets shall be reduced by the aggregate value
attributed to the Scheduled Assets with respect to which Closing does not
occur, and the allocations of the Base Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.7
and the GST and any provincial sales taxes, if applicable, shall be adjusted
accordingly. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

Purchaser hereby confirms to DCC that the ROFR Values allocated by Purchaser
to the Identified ROFRs that become operative by virtue of this Agreement,
will be _bona fide_ values allocated by Purchaser to each specific interest
after diligent review and analysis. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

If at Closing any ROFR has not been waived and the time to elect has not
elapsed (the "Unexpired ROFRs"), Closing shall proceed in respect of the
Assets not subject to the Unexpired ROFRs, and the Parties will deposit into
escrow with Bennett Jones LLP (as "Escrow Agent") pursuant to the ROFR Escrow
Agreement, that portion of the Base Purchase Price allocated to the Assets
subject to the Unexpired ROFRs and all closing documentation and Specific
Conveyances required for the sale of all Assets subject to an Unexpired ROFR
("Escrow Assets").  

---|---|--- 
 



-54- 

         | (e) |

If a ROFR Holder makes any Claim in respect of any ROFR Value, the Parties
shall proceed to Closing without an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price and
with the applicable Assets subject to such ROFR challenge included in the
Assets conveyed at Closing. Purchaser hereby agrees to be liable for and in
addition, hereby indemnifies DCC from and against, all Losses and Liabilities
and Claims suffered, sustained, paid or incurred by the Vendor Group in
respect of any such Claim. Such indemnity shall be subject to the provisions
of Section 5.4 and extend, without limitation to solicitor and his client
costs and expenses and DCC will be entitled to retain its own counsel in
relation to any such dispute. 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

If a ROFR Holder makes any other Claim relating to its rights as a ROFR Holder
prior to Closing, including a Claim that the Transaction triggered a ROFR
that should have been served but was not an Identified ROFR, DCC shall provide
notice of such Claim to Purchaser, whereupon the Parties shall attempt to
reach agreement on the validity of such Claim. If the Parties agree that such
ROFR should have been an Identified ROFR, then within five (5) Business Days
of Purchasers receipt of DCCs notice of such Claim, Purchaser shall provide
DCC with its _bona fide_ allocation of value for the Assets subject to such
Claim. If DCC determine that such ROFR should have been an Identified ROFR but
Purchaser disagrees, then DCC shall determine its _bona fide_ allocation of
value for the Assets subject to such Claim and serve notice of the ROFR to
such ROFR Holder in accordance with Section 8.1(a). If by the fifth (5th)
Business Day prior to Closing, the ROFR subject to such Claim has not been
exercised or waived, the provisions of Section 8.1(d) shall apply as if such
ROFR was an Unexpired ROFR. 

---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

If an Unexpired ROFR is exercised by a Third Party, the Parties will promptly
notify the Escrow Agent thereof in writing and: 

---|---|---

the funds deposited with the Escrow Agent in respect of such Escrow Assets
will be refunded by the Escrow Agent to Purchaser together with the interest
earned thereon while held by the Escrow Agent;

the closing documentation and Specific Conveyances related to such Escrow
Assets deposited with the Escrow Agent will be of no force or effect; and

specific conveyances for such Escrow Assets for execution by DCC and DCC
shall cooperate and use its best efforts to assist Purchaser in its completion
of such documentation. 

---|---|--- 



     | (h) |

If after Closing an Unexpired ROFR is extinguished by lapse of time, waiver or
otherwise (other than as a result of being exercised), the Parties will
promptly notify the Escrow Agent thereof in writing and: 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

the Escrow Agent will promptly pay the funds deposited with the Escrow Agent
in respect of such Escrow Assets to DCC together with the interest thereon
while held by the Escrow Agent; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the Escrow Agent will promptly deliver copies of the closing documentation and
Specific Conveyances deposited with the Escrow Agent in relation to such
Escrow Assets to each Party, such documentation shall be effective and the

-55- 

         | (i) |

From and after Closing, the Parties shall cooperate in respect of and comply
with any ROFRs identified after Closing in accordance with the terms thereof.
Purchaser shall be entitled to receive all proceeds payable by the holders of
any such ROFRs exercised after Closing and there will be no adjustment to the
Adjusted Purchase Price as a consequence of the identification of any such
ROFRs or the exercise thereof after Closing. 

---|---|--- 



     | (j) |

If a ROFR Holder makes any Claim against DCC in respect of ROFRs, the Parties
shall cooperate with each other in the defence of any Claim by a ROFR Holder
against DCC as a Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 5.4.

Unless otherwise agreed by Purchaser, each such notice shall include a request
for a waiver of any Shallow Rights Option to purchase any of the Scheduled
Assets. DCC shall notify Purchaser in writing forthwith upon any Shallow
Rights Option being exercising or waived. DCC shall also be entitled to enter
into such arrangements with the holder of the Shallow Rights Option, upon
agreement of such holder of the Shallow Rights Option, so as to cause the
exercise or waiver of the Shallow Rights Option in a manner that does not
necessarily comply with DCCs obligations in respect of Shallow
Rights Option. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

If a portion of the Scheduled Assets is excluded from the Closing because a
Shallow Rights Option has been exercised pursuant to Section 8.2(a): 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

the terms "Scheduled Assets", "Miscellaneous Interests", "Lands",
"Petroleum and Natural Gas Rights" and "Tangibles", shall be construed as
meaning only that portion of the subject matter of those terms with respect to
which Closing occurs and the Schedules shall be deemed to be revised to
reflect the deletion of the Shallow Rights Option portion of the Scheduled
Assets therefrom; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by One Dollar ($1), and shall not be
subject to any further adjustments whatsoever.

DCC and DCC shall cooperate and use its best efforts to assist Purchaser in
its completion of such documentation.

of time, waiver or otherwise (other than as a result of being exercised), the

Vendors Business. Purchaser shall: 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

deliver, at the Closing Time or reasonably promptly thereafter, replacement
guarantees, letters of credit or other performance assurances as may be
required by such Third Parties (which may include, for the avoidance of doubt,

requirements, if any, after transferring, assigning or novating the

The Parties acknowledge that certain letter-of-credit beneficiaries
identified on Schedule "I" may refuse acceptance of replacement letters of
credit or other performance assurances delivered by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 10.2(a)(i) due to, among other reasons, a delay in such Third Party
recognizing Purchasers ownership of the applicable Assets following Closing.
The Parties agree that any failure by Purchaser to make delivery of the
replacement letters of credit or other replacement performance assurances due
to any such refusal of acceptance shall not be deemed a breach by Purchaser of

provided that Purchaser shall be entitled to make modifications to such terms
and conditions as part of, and comparable to, modifications made to the terms

     | (i) |

for any Employee in receipt of long-term disability benefits immediately prior
to the Closing Time, DCC shall give Purchaser written notice when such
Employee is cleared as fit to return to work (including on modified duties or
on a return to work program), and Purchaser shall no later than five (5)
Business Days after receipt of such notice issue an Offer of Employment so
that such Employees start date is effective as of the date the Employee is
cleared as fit to return to work instead of the Closing Date; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

for the Subsequently Transferred Employees, the start date of a Subsequently
Transferred Employee is anticipated to be sixty (60) days following the
Closing Date, provided that: (A) in connection with any Subsequently
Transferred Employee that remains substantially engaged in the provision of
services pursuant to Section 10.3, DCC may, acting reasonably, extend the
retention of any such Subsequently Transferred Employee for a further period
not to exceed a further thirty (30) days, or such other date as agreed to by
the Parties; and (B) in connection with any Subsequently Transferred Employee
who has in DCCs discretion ceased engaging in the provision of services
pursuant to Section 10.3, the Purchaser may issue an Offer of Employment that

with respect to the Employees identified in Section 11.1(h)(i) and the
Subsequently Transferred Employees, all obligations of Purchaser under
Sections 11.1(c) and 11.1(d) shall run from such Employees start date instead
of the Closing Date. For greater certainty, save and except as provided in
this Section 11.1(h), Offers of Employment shall be made to all Employees
(regardless of whether such Employee is actively employed or on leave of
absence, but not on long-term disability, immediately prior to Closing Time),
except Annex Employees and the Retained Employees, effective as of the Closing
Date and all Offers of Employment to Employees on long-term disability
benefits immediately prior to the Closing Time and to Subsequently Transferred
Employees shall be effective as of the date specified in the applicable Offer
of Employment issued in accordance with this Section 11.1(h).



     | (i) |

Nothing in this Section 11.1, express or implied, will confer upon any other
Person (other than the Parties hereto) any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 11.1. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied, will be construed to establish, amend or modify any
Employee Plan. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in
this Section 11.1 will not create any right in any Employee to any continued
employment with Purchaser or DCC or any of their respective Affiliates, or to
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, and nothing in
this Section 11.1 shall preclude Purchaser or DCC from terminating the
employment or services of any Employee, or from terminating any Employee Plan
in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law, at any time on or after the
Closing.

       11.2 |

Communication With DCCs Employees 

---|---

issuance of the Offers of Employment in accordance with Section 11.1(a),

to generally assist in the transition of Employees as contemplated herein.



   11.3 |

Severance Obligations 

---|--- 
 

DCC shall be entitled to terminate any Employee that does not accept an Offer
of Employment and, subject to Section 5.4(e), DCC shall not be entitled to
settle any Claim by any such terminated Employee without the consent of
Purchaser, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Without limiting the scope of Purchasers obligations in Section
5.2(c), Purchaser shall indemnify and save harmless DCC from and against all
Severance Obligations of the Employees, other than the Retained Employees.



   11.4 |

Obligations to Transferred Employees 

---|--- 
 

Subject to the adjustments in Section 6.1:

term disability and accidental death and dismemberment insurance plans and

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

from the Closing Time (and in respect of the Subsequently Transferred
Employees from their start date), Purchaser shall assume all such obligations
and liabilities in respect of the Employees (other than the Annex Employees
and the Retained Employees) and shall indemnify and save harmless Vendors from
all Claims and Losses and Liabilities which they may suffer, sustain, pay or
incur in respect of any failure of Purchaser to discharge its obligations and
liabilities in respect thereof. 

---|---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, as per Section 11.1(h), above, any Employee in
receipt of long-term disability benefits immediately prior to the Closing

Employee is cleared as fit to return to work. Unused current year vacation and
vacation that has been carried over into the current year for Employees up to

shall provide each Employee with such accrued vacation as well as any
remaining vacation entitlement for the remainder of the year. At the Closing,
DCC shall provide Purchaser with an accurate list of vacation balances
(positive and negative) for the Employees. If requested by Purchaser, DCC

Except as otherwise contemplated herein, the Parties will not, and will cause

---|---|--- 
 



-70-

Confidential Information hereof that is legally required and will use their

the disclosure will be afforded confidential treatment. For certainty, the
foregoing provisions of this Section 12.16(c) shall not prevent, restrict or
delay the Party or its Representatives who received a request to disclose
Confidential Information from disclosing Confidential Information as, when and
in the manner required to comply with Applicable Law or legal process based

advice).

Information will be held in trust by the other Party for the Party providing

Confidential Information, other than as may be expressly set out herein, is
granted to the other Party under this Agreement, by implication or otherwise. 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

Without limitation to any of the other rights and remedies which may otherwise
be available to the Parties under this Agreement, the Parties agree that
monetary damages would not alone be sufficient to remedy any breach by a Party
or its Representatives of any provision of this Section 12.16 and that the
Parties will be entitled to equitable relief, including by injunction and
specific performance, in the event of any breach hereof and in addition to any
other remedy available pursuant to this Agreement or by Applicable Law. The
Parties waive any requirement for the deposit of security or posting of any
bond in connection with the application for or granting of any equitable
remedy.

authorities redacted to exclude any sensitive business or personal information
(to the extent permitted by Applicable Securities Requirements),
which redacted copy shall be provided to the other Party for their review and
comment not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the intended public
filing thereof and the Parties shall, subject to ensuring they will meet their
respective disclosure obligations under Applicable Securities Requirements,
as determined in their sole discretion, accept any reasonable comments
received thereon from the other Party.

one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, as applicable, in each case
with such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld,
and (ii) providing such other Party with, if legally permitted and practically
possible, a reasonable time period to review and comment on such announcement,
statement or other disclosure and giving due consideration to any reasonable
comments thereto; provided that "a reasonable time period" shall in all cases
require a Party to inform the other Party with sufficient time to allow such
