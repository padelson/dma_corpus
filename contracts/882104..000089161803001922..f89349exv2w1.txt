    "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this

B.       The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
    Company have approved this Agreement and approved the Merger.

C.       Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, and as an

the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State, or (b) such later date and time as may be specified in the Certificate
of Merger with the consent of Parent and Company (the "Effective Time").

         1.4      Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective

                  (b)      Cancellation of Shares. Each share of Company Capital

the Company's treasury immediately prior to Effective Time, shall, at the
Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

                  (d)      Conversion of Shares. Subject to the terms of Section

of Company Capital Stock that are held by stockholders duly exercising appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or, to the extent applicable, Chapter
13 of the California Corporations Code (the "California Code") ("Dissenting
Shares")) shall be converted and exchanged into the right to receive a portion
of the Total Merger Consideration as follows:

                           (i)      Company Common Stock. Each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting Shares to the extent provided
in Section 1.9), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive that fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Common Stock Exchange Ratio.

                           (ii)     Series E Preferred Stock. Subject to Section
1.12, each issued and outstanding share of Series E Preferred Stock (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting
Shares to the extent provided in Section 1.9) shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive that fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Series E Exchange Ratio.

                           (iii)    Series D Preferred Stock. Subject to Section
1.12, each issued and outstanding share of Series D Preferred Stock (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting
Shares to the extent provided in Section 1.9) shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive that fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Series D Exchange Ratio.

                           (iv)     Series C Preferred Stock. Subject to Section
1.12, each issued and outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting
Shares to the extent provided in Section 1.9) shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive that fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Series C Exchange Ratio.

                           (v)      Series B Preferred Stock. Subject to Section
1.12, each issued and outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting

without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive that fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Series B Exchange Ratio.

                                       3

<PAGE>

                           (vi)     Series A Preferred Stock. Subject to Section
1.12, each issued and outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting
Shares to the extent provided in Section 1.9) shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive that fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Series A Exchange Ratio.

         1.7      Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock or
Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
applicable Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted.

         1.8      Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any holder
of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder and allocating the initial
distribution of such shares between such holder and the Escrow Agent in
accordance with Section 1.12) shall, upon surrender of such holder's Company
stock certificate(s) (the "Company Stock Certificates"), be paid in cash the
dollar amount equal to such fractional share multiplied by the Parent Common
Stock Price.

         1.9      Dissenting Shares.

                  (a)      Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has
exercised and perfected appraisal or dissenters' rights for such holder's
Dissenting Shares in accordance with applicable law and who, as of the Effective
Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters'
rights, shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(d) (and cash in lieu of fractional shares
in accordance with Section 1.8), but the holder thereof shall only be entitled
to such rights as are granted by applicable law.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), if
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) his or her appraisal or dissenters' rights
under applicable law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
occurrence of such event, the shares of Company Capital Stock held by such
Stockholder that formerly constituted Dissenting Shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive Parent Common Stock as
provided in Section 1.6(d) (and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with Section 1.8), without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock
Certificate representing such shares.

                  (c)      The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written
notice of its receipt of any written demand for appraisal in respect of any
shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments relating to the Merger served pursuant to applicable law and
received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and

                                       4

<PAGE>

proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such
demands or offers to settle or settle any such demands.

         1.10     Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the Effective
Time: (a) all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease

Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except the
right to receive the consideration described in Section 1.6(d); and (b) the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares
of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. Subject to Section 1.11(f)
if, after the Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate previously
representing any of such shares of Company Capital Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.11) or to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged
as provided in Section 1.11.

         1.11     Exchange of Certificates.

                  (a)      Exchange Agent. Mellon Investor Services LLC or such
other institution selected by Parent with the reasonable consent of the Company
shall act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

                  (b)      Parent to Provide Common Stock and Cash. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall supply or cause to be supplied to the
Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Section 1 through such
reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt: (i) certificates evidencing the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(d) in exchange
for shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited
into an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") pursuant to the requirements of Section
1.12 and Section 7.2; and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.8 (collectively, (i) and
(ii) shall be referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

                  (c)      Exchange Procedures. At least 10 business days prior
to the Effective Time, the Company, on behalf of Parent, shall cause to be
mailed to each holder of record of a Company Stock Certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time would represent outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock, whose shares would be converted into the right to receive shares
of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) pursuant to
Section 1.6(d), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates
shall pass, only upon receipt of the Company Stock Certificates by the Exchange
Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify, including a lock-up provision for a period not to exceed
ninety (90) days after the Effective Time for 50% of the aggregate Preferred
Merger Shares (with any Preferred Merger Shares subject to the Escrow Fund being
subject to the lock-up), issuable to Stockholders); (ii) such other customary
documents as may be required pursuant

                                       5

<PAGE>

to such instructions; and (iii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Company Stock Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). Upon
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
after the Effective Time or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal and other documents, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the
holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefore (x) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to Sections 1.12
and 7.2 hereof, (y) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.11(d), and (z) cash (without interest) in respect
of fractional shares as provided in Section 1.8, and the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered,
each outstanding Company Stock Certificate that prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes other than the payment of dividends,
to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock
into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so converted and
the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional
shares in accordance with Section 1.8. If any Company Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent
Common Stock require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

                  (d)      Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company
Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate. Subject to
applicable law, following surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate, there
shall be paid to the record holder of the Company Stock Certificate a
certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest at the time of such surrender, the amount of any such
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.11(d)) with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

                  (e)      Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares
of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Company Stock Certificate
so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent
or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

<PAGE>

                  (f)      Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any stockholders of the Company who have not previously complied with this
Section 1.11 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
their portion of the Merger Shares and any dividends or distributions with
respect to the Merger Shares.

                  (g)      No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 1.11, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

                  (h)      Dissenting Shares. The provisions of this Section
1.11 shall also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such,
except that the obligations of Parent under this Section 1.11 shall commence on
the date of loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange for such Merger Shares to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.6.

                  (i)      Stockholder Loans. Section 2.4 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists each outstanding loan from the Company held by any
stockholder or employee of the Company as of the Effective Time (the
"Stockholder Loans").

         1.12     Escrow. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.2 hereof, Parent
shall cause to be distributed to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 7.2
hereof) a certificate or certificates representing the sum of (i) [****]% of the
Aggregate Preferred Consideration to be issued at the Closing plus (ii) [****]%
of the Management Bonus Shares to be issued at the Closing pursuant to the
Management Acquisition Bonus Agreements (collectively, the "Escrow Shares")
(which shall be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent as nominee for the
holders of Company Stock Certificates canceled pursuant to Section 1.11). Such
shares shall be beneficially owned by such holders and such shares shall be held
in escrow and shall be available to compensate Parent for certain damages as
provided in Section 7. To the extent not used for such purposes, such shares
shall be released, all as provided in Section 7.

         1.13     Exemption from Registration, California Permit. Parent and the
Company intend that the Merger Shares will be issued in a transaction exempt
from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder, by
reason of Section 3(a)(l0) thereof and will be qualified under the California
Code pursuant to Section 25121 thereof after a fairness hearing has been held
pursuant to the authority granted by Section 25142 of the California Code (the
"Fairness

Hearing"). Parent, with and subject to the full cooperation of the Company,
shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to file promptly (and to the
extent reasonably practicable, within five (5) business days) following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, an application (the "Permit
Application") for issuance of a permit pursuant to Section 25121 of the
California Code to issue such securities (the "California Permit") and (ii) to
obtain the California Permit promptly thereafter.

         1.14     Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and
the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company
and otherwise) to take such action.

the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which either the ownership or
use of the properties owned or used by it, or the nature of the activities

result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                  (b)      The Company has delivered to Parent copies of the
Company Certificate, Company Bylaws and other organizational documents of the
Company and each Subsidiary, as currently in effect.

         2.4      No Conflict. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party, does
not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
will not (i) conflict with, or result in any violation of, any provision of the
Company Certificate (in its current form and as it shall be amended immediately
prior to the Effective Time) or Company Bylaws, (ii) conflict with, or result in
any violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or

conflict with, or result in any violation of any judgment, order, decree,

of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' business or the holding of any such
interest and all of such authorizations are in full force and effect except
where the failure to obtain or have

                                       9

<PAGE>

any such authorizations could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

         2.7      Capitalization.

                  (a)      The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of: (i) 75,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, of which 7,641,186 shares
have been issued and are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement; and (ii)
50,356,750 shares of Company Preferred Stock, (A) of which 950,000 shares are

are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement; (B) of which 10,406,750 shares

with the domicile addresses and in the amounts set forth on Section 2.7(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. There are not any notes or other indebtedness
or securities of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
Stockholders may vote. There are no shares of Company Capital Stock held in
treasury. All of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (i) have been
duly authorized and validly issued, and are fully paid, non-assessable and free
of all liens or encumbrances other than any liens or encumbrances created by or
imposed by the holders thereof, (ii) are not subject to preemptive rights or
rights of first refusal created by statute, the Company Certificate, the Company
Bylaws or any agreement to which the Company is a part or by which it is bound
and (iii) have been issued in compliance with federal and state securities laws.
There are no declared or unpaid dividends with respect to any shares of the
Company's Capital Stock. Each share of Company Preferred Stock is convertible
into one share of Company Common Stock. Except as described in this Section
2.7(a), the Company has no other capital stock authorized, issued or
outstanding.

                  (b)      Except for the Company's 1997 Stock Plan (the
"Company Stock Option Plan") or as set forth in Section 2.7(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not have any stock option plan or other
plan providing for any equity compensation for any Person. The Company has
reserved 10,435,000 shares of Company Common Stock for issuance under the
Company Stock Option Plan, of which, as of the date of this Agreement, 983,539
shares have been exercised and 4,971,401 shares are subject to outstanding
options. Stock options granted by the Company pursuant to its stock option plans
and any stock options granted outside of the Company Stock Option Plan are
referred to in this Agreement as "Company Options." The Company has delivered to
Parent accurate and complete copies of all stock option plans pursuant to which
the Company (or any of its predecessors) has ever granted stock options. Section
2.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately sets forth as of the date
of this Agreement, the names of all persons who hold outstanding Company
Options, and sets forth for each such person (i) the plans under which Company
Options have been issued to such

                                       10

<PAGE>

person, (ii) the number of vested Company Options held by such person, (iii) a
vesting schedule for the unvested Company Options held by such person and (iv)
the exercise prices for such Company Options. As of the date of this Agreement,
there were 200,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 78,000 shares of Company
Series B Preferred Stock, and 727,458 shares of Company Series D Preferred Stock
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding Company Warrants, and the
Company Warrants are held by the persons, with the domicile addresses and in the
amounts set forth in Section 2.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The
Company has delivered to Parent true and complete copies of each warrant and
warrant agreement evidencing each Company Warrant and each form of agreement or
stock option plan evidencing each Company Option. Except for the rights created
pursuant to this Agreement and the rights otherwise described in this Section
2.7, there are no other options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or
agreements of any character to which Company is a party or by which it is bound,
obligating Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem or cause to be
issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of Company Capital
Stock or obligating Company to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, change
the price of, or otherwise amend or enter into any such option, warrant, call,
right, commitment or agreement. All shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Company Preferred Stock or upon exercise of the Company
Options described in this Section 2.7, and all shares of Company Preferred Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Company Warrants, will be, when issued pursuant to
the respective terms of such Preferred Stock, Company Options or Company
Warrants, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There
are no other contracts, commitments or agreements relating to voting, purchase
or sale of Company's capital stock (a) between or among Company and any of its
stockholders; and (b) to Company's Knowledge, between or among any of Company's
stockholders, except for the stockholders delivering the Voting Agreements. As a
result of the Merger, Parent will be the record and sole beneficial owner of all
outstanding Company Capital Stock.

         2.8      Company Financial Statements. The Company has delivered to
Parent its audited financial statements (balance sheet, statement of operations
and statement of cash flows) for each of the fiscal years ended 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively, (collectively, the "Year-End Financials") and its unaudited
financial statements (balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of
cash flows) on a consolidated basis as at and for the twelve-month period ended
December 31, 2002 (the "Interim Financials"). Section 2.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains the Company's unaudited balance sheet as of
December 31, 2002 (the "Current Balance Sheet"). The Year-End Financials and the
Interim Financials have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated and with each other, subject,
in the case of the Interim Financials, to normal recurring year-end adjustments
(none of which, individually or in the aggregate, are material) and a lack of
footnotes. The Year-End Financials and the Interim Financials fairly present the
consolidated financial condition and operating results of Company as of the
dates, and for the periods, indicated therein. The Company maintains a standard
system of accounting established and administered in accordance with GAAP.

         2.9      Absence of Certain Changes. Since December 31, 2002 (the "Base
Date"), the Company has conducted its business in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice and there has not occurred (a) any change, event or condition
(whether or not covered by insurance)

                                       11

<PAGE>

that has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company; (b) any acquisition, sale or transfer of any
assets or properties of the Company or any creation of any security interest in
such assets or properties; (c) any change in accounting methods or practices
(including any change in depreciation or amortization policies or rates) by the
Company or any revaluation by the Company of any of its assets; (d) any
declaration, setting aside, or payment of a dividend or other distribution with
respect to the shares of the Company or any direct or indirect redemption,
purchase or other acquisition by the Company of any of its shares of capital
stock; (e) any Material Contract entered into by the Company, or any material
amendment or termination of, or default under, any Material Contract to which
the Company is a party or by which it is bound; (f) any amendment or change to
the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws; (g) any increase in or modification
of the compensation or benefits payable or to become payable by the Company to
any of its directors or employees; or (h) any agreement by the Company to do any
of the things described in the preceding clauses (a) through (g).

         2.10     No Undisclosed Liabilities. The Company has no liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent (or otherwise),
except for (i) liabilities or obligations reflected or reserved against in the
Current Balance Sheet, (ii) current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
of business and which do not have and could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and (iii) liabilities incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby since the Base Date.

         2.11     Title to Property; Absence of Encumbrances; Condition of
Equipment.

                  (a)      Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns
any real property nor has the Company or any Subsidiary ever owned any real
property. Section 2.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of all real property currently leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries, the
name of the lessor, the date of the lease and each amendment thereto and, with
respect to any current lease, the aggregate annual rental and/or other fees
payable under any such lease. All such current leases are in full force and
effect, are valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms, and
there is not, under any of such leases, any existing default or event of default
(or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default).

                  (b)      The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and valid
title to the properties, real and personal, reflected in the Current Balance
Sheet or acquired after the date thereof. All leasehold interests of the Company
are free and clear of any Encumbrances, except (i) statutory Encumbrances
securing payments not yet due and (ii) such imperfections or irregularities of
title or Encumbrances as do not affect the use of the properties or assets
subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business
operations at such properties, in either case in such a manner as to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                  (c)      Section 2.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists all material items of equipment (the "Equipment") owned or leased by the
Company or its Subsidiaries and such Equipment is, (i) adequate for the conduct
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted and
(ii) in good operating condition, regularly and properly maintained, subject to
normal wear and tear.

                                       12

<PAGE>

         2.12     Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no agreement
(non-compete or otherwise), judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has or reasonably could be expected
to have, the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any currently
contemplated acquisition of property by the Company or its Subsidiaries or the
conduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of its business as currently
conducted or as currently proposed to be conducted.

         2.13     Interested Party Transactions. Except as set forth on Section
2.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is indebted to any director, officer or employee of the Company or a Subsidiary
(except for amounts due as normal salaries and bonuses and in reimbursement of
ordinary expenses), and no such person is indebted to the Company or any
Subsidiary. Since January 1, 2002, the Company has not entered into any
transaction involving over $60,000 in which any director, officer or 5%
stockholder (or a member of such person's immediate family) had a direct or
indirect material interest, except where such person's interest arises solely
from his or her ownership of Company Capital Stock.

         2.14     Intellectual Property.

                  (a)      Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries owns and has
good and marketable title to, or possesses legally enforceable rights to use,
all Intellectual Property currently used or currently proposed to be used in the
business of the Company or its Subsidiaries as currently conducted or currently
proposed to be conducted by the Company. The Intellectual Property owned by and
licensed to the Company and its Subsidiaries collectively constitutes all of the
Intellectual Property necessary to enable the Company and its Subsidiaries to
conduct its business as such business is currently being conducted. To the
Company's Knowledge, there is no unauthorized use, disclosure or
misappropriation of any Company Intellectual Property (as defined in Section
2.14(b) below) or any Third Party Intellectual Property by any employee or
former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or by any other Person. There
are no royalties, fees or other payments payable by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to any Person under any written or oral contract or understanding
by reason of the Company's ownership, use, sale or disposition of Intellectual

legal opinion from Gray, Cary, Ware and Freidenrich, legal counsel to Parent, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F.

                  (d)      Company Certificate. The liquidation preferences
provisions of the Company Certificate shall be amended as necessary to provide
for the payment of the Preferred Merger Consideration and the Common Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (e)      No Material Adverse Change. There shall not have
occurred any change in the business, condition (financial or otherwise), results
of operations or assets (including intangible assets) and properties of Parent
that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                  (f)      Secretary's Certificate. The Company shall have
received from Parent a certificate, validly executed by the Secretary of Parent,
certifying that (i) attached as exhibits thereto are true and complete copies of
Parent's Certificate of Incorporation and Parent's Bylaws, each as in effect as
of Closing, and (ii) attached as exhibits thereto are true and complete copies
of resolutions duly adopted by the Board of Directors of Parent, approving the
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, which
resolutions remain in full force and effect as of the Closing and are the only
resolutions so adopted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (g)      Ancillary Agreements. Parent shall have executed and
delivered to the Company the Escrow Agreement and any other Ancillary Agreements
contemplated by this Agreement to which Parent is a signatory.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                           INDEMNIFICATION AND ESCROW

         7.1      Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements. Notwithstanding any right of Parent or the Company (whether or not
exercised) to investigate the affairs of Parent or the Company (whether pursuant
to Section 5.2 or otherwise) or a waiver or non-assertion by Parent or the
Company of any condition to Closing set forth in Article VI or any termination
right set forth in Article VIII, each party shall have the right to rely fully
upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other
party contained in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements. All of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company
contained in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements shall

the Merger and continue until the [****] anniversary of the Effective Time (the
"Expiration Date").

         7.2      Escrow and Indemnification.

                  (a)      Escrow Fund.

                           (i)      At the Closing, the Escrow Shares shall be
registered in the name of, and be deposited with, U.S. Bank Trust (or other
institution selected by Parent with the reasonable consent of the Company) as
escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), such deposit and any Additional Escrow Shares
to constitute the Escrow Fund and to be governed by the terms set forth herein
and in the Escrow Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit G. The Escrow Fund shall
be available to compensate Parent pursuant to the indemnification obligations of
the Stockholders. In the event Parent issues any Additional Escrow Shares, such
shares will be issued in the name of the Escrow Agent and delivered to the
Escrow Agent in the same manner as the Escrow Shares delivered at the Closing.

                           (ii)     Except for dividends paid in stock declared
with respect to the Escrow Shares ("Additional Escrow Shares"), which shall be
treated as Escrow Shares pursuant to this Section 7.2 and all references in this
Section 7.2 to the term "Escrow Shares" shall be deemed to include any
Additional Escrow Shares, any cash dividends, dividends payable in securities or
other distributions of any kind made in respect of the Escrow Shares will be
delivered to the Stockholders of the Company on a pro rata basis based upon
their respective interests in the Escrow Fund at the time of distribution (in
each case, such Stockholder's "Pro Rata Share"). Each Stockholder of the Company
will have voting rights with respect to such stockholder's Pro Rata Share of the
Escrow Shares deposited in the Escrow Fund so long as such Escrow Shares are
held in escrow, and Parent will take all reasonable steps necessary to allow the
exercise of such rights. While the Escrow Shares remain in the Escrow Agent's
possession pursuant to this Agreement, each Stockholder of the Company will
retain and will be able to exercise all other incidents of ownership of such
stockholder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Shares which are not inconsistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

                  (b)      Indemnification.

                           (i)      Indemnification. Subject to the limitations
set forth in this Section 7.2, the Stockholders will, severally and not jointly,
and in accordance with each such Stockholder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow
Fund, indemnify and hold harmless Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their
respective officers, directors, agents, attorneys and employees, and each
person, if any, who controls or may control Parent or the Surviving Corporation
within the meaning of the Securities Act (individually a "Parent Indemnified
Person" and collectively the "Parent Indemnified Persons") from and against any
and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses arising from claims,
demands, actions, causes of action, including, without and

<PAGE>

each person, if any, who controls or may control Parent or the Surviving
Corporation within the meaning of the Securities Act (individually a "Parent
Indemnified Person" and collectively the "Parent Indemnified Persons") from and
against any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses arising
from claims, demands, actions, causes of action, including, without limitation,
legal fees, (collectively, "Damages") arising out of, resulting from or incident
to (i) any misrepresentation or breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements given or made by the Company in this
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule or any exhibit or schedule to this
Agreement, (ii) the Excess Employee Expenses (to the extent such Excess Employee
Expenses were not deducted from the Preferred Merger Consideration), (iii) all
Excess Transaction Fees (to the extent that such Excess Transaction Fees were
not deducted from the Preferred Merger Consideration), and (iv) any Excess
Liabilities (to the extent that such Excess Liabilities were not deducted from
the Preferred Merger Consideration). Except as set forth in Section 7.2(b)(ii),
the sole recourse of the Parent Indemnified Persons shall be against the Escrow
Fund and claims against the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent Indemnified Persons for any Damages in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties shall cooperate in the
administration of this Article XII to ensure that there is no double-counting
for claims (e.g., an item that gives rise to both an Excess Employee Expense and
an Excess Liability will only be counted once in determining the appropriate
claim against the Escrow Fund).

                           (ii)     No Limitation. Nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the liability in amount or otherwise (A) of the Company for any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant if the Merger does not close;
or (B) of any Company Stockholder in connection with any breach by such
Stockholder of any representation or covenant in the Voting Agreement, or (C) of
the Company with respect to fraud or criminal activity or intentional breach of
any covenant contained in this Agreement.

                           (iii)    Threshold for Claims. No claim for Damages
shall be made under Section 7.2 unless the aggregate of Damages exceeds $[****]
for which claims are made hereunder by the Parent Indemnified Persons, in which
case the Parent Indemnified Person shall be entitled to seek compensation for
all Damages without regard to the limitation set forth in this Section
7.2(b)(iii) (the "Limitation").

                  (c)      Expiration Date; Release From Escrow.

                           (i)      The Escrow Fund shall terminate upon the
Expiration Date; provided, however, that a portion of the Escrow Fund that, in
the reasonable judgment of Parent subject to the objection of the Stockholders'
Agent and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in
Section 7.2(f), is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any
Officer's Certificate (as defined below) delivered to the Escrow Agent on or
prior to the Expiration Date, with respect to facts and circumstances existing
on or prior to the Expiration

Date (the "Disputed Portion"), shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such claims
have been resolved.

                           (ii)     If any Escrow Shares remain in the Escrow
Fund on the Expiration Date, within two (2) business days after such date (the
"Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall release from escrow to the Stockholders
their Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Shares less the Disputed Portion, if any. Any
Disputed Portion shall be released to the Stockholders according to their Pro
Rata Share of such Disputed Portion or released to Parent (as appropriate)
promptly upon resolution of each specific indemnification claim for Damages
involved. Parent will take such action as may be necessary to cause such
certificates to be issued in the names of the appropriate persons. No fractional
shares shall be released and delivered from Escrow to the Stockholders. In lieu
of any fraction of an Escrow Share to which a Stockholder would otherwise be
entitled, such Stockholder will receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by
the Parent Common Stock Price.

                           (iii)    No Escrow Shares or any beneficial interest
therein may be pledged, sold, assigned or transferred, including by operation of
law, by any Stockholder or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process
in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of any such Stockholder, prior to
the delivery to such stockholder of such Stockholder's pro rata portion of the
Escrow Fund by the Escrow Agent as provided herein.

                           (iv)     The Escrow Agent is hereby granted the power
to effect any transfer of Escrow Shares contemplated by this Agreement. Parent
will cooperate with the Escrow Agent in promptly issuing stock certificates to
effect such transfers.

                  (d)      Claims Upon Escrow Fund. Upon receipt by the Escrow
Agent on or before the Expiration Date of a certificate signed by any officer of
Parent (an "Officer's Certificate") alleging in good faith that Damages exist or
are reasonably anticipated from threatened or pending litigation with respect to
the indemnification obligations of the Stockholders of the Company set forth in
Section 7.2(b), and specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such
Damages included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, or
properly accrued or arose, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, covenant or claim to which such item is related, the Escrow Agent
shall, subject to the provisions of this Section 7.2, deliver to Parent out of
the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, Parent Common Stock or other assets
held in the Escrow Fund having a value equal to such Damages. For the purpose of
compensating Parent for its Damages pursuant to this Agreement, the Parent
Common Stock in the Escrow Fund shall be valued at the Parent Common Stock
Price.

                  (e)      Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any
Officer's Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Officer's
Certificate shall be delivered to the Stockholders' Agent. For a period of
thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery of
Parent Common Stock or other property pursuant to Section 7.2(d) unless the
Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Stockholders'
Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of the Parent Common Stock or other
property in the Escrow Fund in accordance

                                       43

<PAGE>

with Section 7.2(d), provided that no such payment or delivery may be made if
the Stockholders' Agent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in
the Officer's Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the
Escrow Agent and to Parent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period. In the event that in connection with the Stockholders' Agent's
investigation of any such claim he shall make a request to Parent for
information about the claim in accordance with Section 7.2(h)(iii), and access
to such information is not provided within a reasonable amount of time, the
running of such 30-day period shall be tolled for a period in time equal to the
duration of any such delay in access.

                  (f)      Resolution of Conflicts and Arbitration.

                           (i)      If the Stockholders' Agent objects in
writing to any claim or claims made by Parent in any Officer's Certificate
within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Officer's Certificate by Parent
to the Stockholders' Agent, the Stockholders' Agent and Parent shall attempt in
good faith for a period of not to exceed 30 days to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each such claim. If the Stockholders' Agent
and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent.
The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall
distribute the appropriate portion of the Escrow Amount from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of the memorandum.

                           (ii)     If no such agreement can be reached after
good faith negotiation within such 30-day period, either Parent or the
Stockholders' Agent may demand arbitration of any such matter; provided,
however, that if the amount of the Damages at issue is the subject of pending
litigation with a third party, arbitration shall not be commenced until such
amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration. In either such
event, the matter shall be settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco,
California under the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") International
Arbitration Rules and Supplemental Procedures for Large Complex Disputes (the
"AAA Rules") by one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be conducted by a neutral
arbitrator who is independent and disinterested with respect to the parties,
this Agreement, and the outcome of the arbitration. If the parties are unable to
agree to an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be appointed by AAA in accordance
with the AAA Rules, upon the application of either party. Any appeal shall be
heard and decided by a panel of three neutral arbitrators selected from the same
panel as the initial arbitrator. The parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in causing the arbitration to be
held in as efficient and expeditious a manner as practicable, including but not
limited to, providing such documents and making available such of their
personnel as the arbitrator may request, so that the arbitrator's decision on
the matter may be timely. The arbitrator shall have the power to decide all
questions of arbitrability. The parties to the arbitration may apply to any
court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
injunction or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach
of this arbitration provision and without any abridgement of the powers of the
arbitrators but shall not otherwise have the rights to remove the proceedings to
a court of law or equity or superseded the arbitration by a judicial proceeding
except by mutual consent. The parties hereto agree that, any provision of
applicable law notwithstanding, they will not request and the arbitrator shall
have no authority to award punitive or exemplary damages against any party and
that the remedy or relief granted by the arbitrator must be consistent with

                                       44

<PAGE>

the remedies and limitations set forth in this Agreement. Judgment on the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. The arbitrator may award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined
by the arbitrator, all of its reasonable costs and fees, including, without
limitation, AAA administrative fees, arbitrator fees and attorney's fees. Unless
and until the arbitrator decides that one party is to apply for all (or share)
of such expenses, or unless otherwise set forth in this Agreement, both parties
shall share equally in the payment of the arbitrator's fees as and when billed
by the arbitrator.

                           (iii)    Except as set forth below, the parties shall
keep confidential the fact of the arbitration, the dispute being arbitrated, and
the decision of the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may
disclose information about the arbitration to persons who have a need to know,
such as directors, trustees, management employees, witnesses, experts,
investors, attorneys, lenders, insurers, and others who may be directly
affected. Additionally, if a party has stock that is publicly traded, the party
may make such disclosures as are required by applicable securities laws.
Further, if a party is expressly asked by a third party about the dispute or the
arbitration, the party may disclose and acknowledge in general and limited terms
that there is a dispute with the other party that is being (or has been)
arbitrated. Once the arbitration award has become final, if the arbitration
award is not promptly satisfied, then these confidentiality provisions shall no
longer be applicable.

                           (iv)     The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in
accordance with such judgment and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow
Fund in accordance therewith. Promptly following its receipt thereof, the Escrow
Agent shall distribute the Escrow Shares in accordance with the terms of the
arbitration award and/or the judgment in accordance with the procedures
specified in Section 7.2(d) hereof.

                  (g)      Recoveries. The amount of indemnifiable Damages
required to be paid under this Article VII shall be reduced by (or if already
paid, shall be promptly repaid in the amount of) any recoveries actually
received by an Parent Indemnified Person under insurance policies or other form
of payment received from a third party.

                  (h)      Stockholders' Agent.

                           (i)      Fred Craves shall be constituted and
appointed as agent ("Stockholders' Agent") for and on behalf of the Stockholders
to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent
of the Parent Common Stock or other property from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such deliveries to make claims on
behalf of the Stockholders pursuant to Section 7.2(e) to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and
to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholders' Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be
changed by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund from time to
time upon not less than 10 days' prior written notice to Parent. No bond shall
be required of the Stockholders' Agent, and the Stockholders' Agent shall
receive no compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from
the Stockholders' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the Company
stockholders.

                                       45

<PAGE>

                           (ii)     The Stockholders' Agent shall not be liable
for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder' Agent while acting in good
faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith. The Stockholders shall severally indemnify and hold the Stockholders'
Agent harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders' Agent and arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties
hereunder.

                           (iii)    The Stockholders' Agent shall have
reasonable access to information about the Company and the reasonable assistance
of the Company's officers and employees for purposes of performing his duties
and exercising his rights hereunder, provided that the Stockholders' Agent shall
treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about
the Company to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree
to treat such information confidentially).

                  (i)      Actions of the Stockholders' Agent. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders' Agent shall constitute a decision of
all the Company stockholders for whom shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise
issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon each such the Company stockholder, and the Escrow Agent and
Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders' Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
and every such the Company stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby
relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders'
Agent.

                  (j)      Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware
of a third-party claim which Parent believes may result in a demand against the
Escrow Fund, Parent shall notify the Stockholders' Agent of such claim, and the
Stockholders' Agent and the Company Stockholders for whom shares of Parent
Common Stock otherwise issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund shall
be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of such claim with
the consent of Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Whether or not
the Stockholders' Agent participates in the defense of such claim, Parent shall
be entitled to compromise or settle such claim; provided, however, that Parent
shall not compromise or settle such claim without the prior written consent of
the Stockholders' Agent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. In the
event that the Stockholders' Agent has consented to any such settlement, the
Stockholders' Agent shall have no power or authority to object under Section
7.2(e) or any other provision of this Section 7.2 to any claim by Parent against
the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement for the amount of
the settlement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                             TERMINATION PROVISIONS

         8.1      Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the

Company's stockholders):

                  (a)      by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

                                       46

<PAGE>

                  (b)      by either Parent or the Company if: (i) the Merger
shall not have been consummated by April 30, 2003 (unless the failure to
consummate the Merger is attributable to a failure on the part of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform any material obligation required
to be performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time), (ii) there
shall be a final nonappealable order of a federal or state court in effect
preventing consummation of the Merger; or (iii) there shall be any statute,
rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to
the Merger by any Governmental Entity that would make consummation of the Merger
illegal; provided, however, that (x) the Company may elect to extend such date
to May 31, 2003 if holders of the Company Stockholder Loan elect to increase the
principal amount of the Company Stockholder Loan to such amount as is necessary
to fund the operations of the Company through May 31, 2003, and (y) Parent may
elect to extend such date to May 31, 2003 if the Company has not by April 26,
2003 notified Parent in writing of its election to extend such date under clause
(x) of this section, and of the increase of the principal amount of the Company
Stockholder Loan, and such election by Parent shall be made in writing by notice
to the Company on or prior to April 30, 2003. If Parent makes such election, it
shall advance Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (or such lesser amount as may be
requested by the Company) to the Company on May 1, 2003 as a Parent Loan;

                  (c)      by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any
law or rule enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger,
by any Governmental Entity, which would: (i) prohibit Parent's ownership or
operation of all or any portion of the business of the Company or (ii) compel
Parent to dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of the Assets and
Properties of the Company, or limit its operation of the Company's business, as
a result of the Merger;

                  (d)      by Parent if it is not in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement and there has been a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreements on the part of the Company and such breach has not been
cured within ten (10) calendar days after written notice to the Company;
provided, however, that, no cure period shall be required for a breach which by
its nature cannot be cured;

                  (e)      by Company if it is not in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement and there has been a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreements on the part of Parent and such breach has not been
cured within ten (10) calendar days after written notice to Parent; provided,
however, that, no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature
cannot be cured;

                  (f)      by Parent if, since the date of this Agreement, there
shall have occurred any Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or there shall
have occurred any event or circumstance that, in combination with any other
events or circumstances, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company; or

                  (g)      by the Company if, since the date of this Agreement,
there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or there shall
have occurred any event or

                                       47

<PAGE>

circumstance that, in combination with any other events or circumstances, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                  (h)      by Parent if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in any Voting
Agreement on the part of any Stockholder party thereto that has a material and
adverse impact on Parent's ability to consummate the Merger.

         8.2      Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect; provided, however, that (i) this Section 8.2, Section 5.3,
Section 5.6 and Section 5.14 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
shall remain in full force and effect, and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability for any material
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or any material breach of any
warranty, covenant or other provision contained in this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         9.1      Amendment. This Agreement may be amended with the approval of
the respective boards of directors of the Company and Parent at any time. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of the parties hereto.

         9.2      Waiver.

                  (a)      No failure on the part of any party to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part
of any party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy;
and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy
shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power,
