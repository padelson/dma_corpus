ARTICLE II.

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of
the Company, Parent or Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share (each, a " _Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, but
including Shares of Restricted Stock as provided in  _Section_ __ _
2.03(c)_, shall automatically be converted into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive $50.00 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without
interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, and all of such Shares
automatically shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such a Share (a " _Certificate_ ") or such a non-
certificated Share represented immediately prior to the Effective Time by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (in each case, other than Excluded
Shares) shall thereafter automatically be cancelled and cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (subject to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_) without interest thereon in accordance with, and
subject to the conditions of, this _Article_ __ _ II_.

(ii) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any
wholly-owned Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent or
any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

 



3

    

(iii) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders
of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
Computershare Trust Company N.A. or another U.S.-based nationally recognized
financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to
which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. At
the Closing and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount in cash equal to the Aggregate Common Stock
Consideration (other than amounts attributable to Shares of Restricted Stock)
(the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be for the benefit of the
holders of Shares that are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (other
than Shares of Restricted Stock). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash sufficient
to make such payments. Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be
invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-term obligations
of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest
by, the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30)
days, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_;  _provided_ , that no investment of
such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this _Section_ __ _
2.02_, and following any losses from any such investment that result in the
Exchange Fund being insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Shares of
Restricted Stock), an amount in cash equal to the amount necessary to make the
Exchange Fund sufficient to make such payments, which additional funds
will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds initially deposited
with the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
2.02_. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. Parent shall direct
the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the former
holders of Shares (other than Shares of Restricted Stock) and to make payments
from the Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_, except as expressly provided for in
this Agreement. 

 



4

    

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificated Shares_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(i)_: (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) to the Paying Agent and shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify, subject to the reasonable consent of the Company, and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of such a Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
2.02(e)_) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter
of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificate, together with such other customary documents as may reasonably
be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.02(d)_, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into
which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were converted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(i)_, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
may be made and the Merger Consideration may be issued to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay to Parent or
the Paying Agent any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate so surrendered or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent and Parent that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not required to be paid.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Book-Entry Share
whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(i)_ customary instructions for effecting
the transfer of the Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration for each such Share evidenced by such Book-Entry Share. Upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer, in each case, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request
in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Book-Entry Share shall,
subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(d)_, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which
the Shares formerly represented by such Book-Entry Shares were converted
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, and the Book-Entry Shares so
transferred shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 



5

    

(iii) No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the
Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) or in
respect of any Book-Entry Share.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the nine (9) month anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with
respect thereto) not disbursed to or claimed by holders of Shares,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as

extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving

of a Share for Merger Consideration previously entitled thereto.

been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Paying Agent) of that fact

Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.01(a)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Paying Agent

Equity Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions to provide that, (1) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under a Company Stock Plan (the
" _Company Options_ ") shall be fully vested and (2) at the Effective Time
shall be automatically cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any
such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration
of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a
payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Shares subject to such cancelled Company Option (whether vested or unvested),
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over
(B) the exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Option,
without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ "),
which shall be paid in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(e)_; _provided_
, _however_ , that (x) any such Company Option with respect to which the
exercise price per Share subject thereto is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration upon
the Effective Time and (y) such Option Payments shall be reduced by the amount
of any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_. From
and after the Effective Time, no Company Option shall be outstanding or
exercisable, and each Company Option shall only entitle the holder thereof to
the payment, if any, provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions to provide that, (1) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding award of restricted stock units (" _Stock Units_ ") with respect
to Shares, including performance-based Stock Units (each, a " _Stock Unit
Award_ ") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan shall be fully vested, with
applicable performance goals deemed to have been satisfied at the target level
of performance, and (2) at the Effective Time be automatically cancelled and
converted into a right to receive a payment in cash of an amount equal to the
sum of (i) the product of (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the
number of Shares subject to such Stock Unit Award, without interest and (ii)
the dividend equivalents accrued on such Stock Unit Award prior to the Closing
Date (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Stock Unit Payments_ "), which
shall be paid in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(e)_. Such Stock Unit
Payments and any dividend equivalents accrued on such Stock Unit Awards may be
reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_. 

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and without any action on the part of
Parent, Sub, the Company or any holder of an outstanding award of restricted
stock (" _Restricted Stock_ ") under a Company Stock Plan (a " _Restricted
Stock Award_ "), (1) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Restricted
Stock Award shall become fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall lapse
and (2) at the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Award shall be
automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount equal to the sum of (i) the product of the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Award,
without interest, and (ii) the dividends accrued on such Restricted Stock
Award prior to the Closing Date, which shall be reduced by the amount of any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ and be paid in

Stock Plans shall terminate.

 

(e) _Parent Funding_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Surviving Corporation or an account identified by
Parent prior to the Effective Time (the identity of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company) cash in an amount sufficient to allow the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to make the payments required
under this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to make, or cause one of its Subsidiaries to make, the payments
required under this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time (but no later than the first payroll date that is at
least ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time), in each case, subject
to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_.

 

(f) _A_ _ctions Prior to Closing_. The Company shall, prior to the Effective
Time, take or cause to be taken all actions (including adopting all
resolutions, providing notices and procuring consents (after review and
approval by Parent of the forms thereof)) that are required under the Company
Stock Plans, applicable Law or this Agreement, or are otherwise reasonably
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the cancellation of the Company
Options, Stock Units and Restricted Stock Awards and other transactions
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ and to ensure that, from and after
the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Option, Stock Unit Award or
Restricted Stock Award cancelled as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the consideration (if any) specified in and subject to the terms of
this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, without interest. In addition, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a person (a "
_Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and has complied with all the provisions of the OGCL concerning the
right of holders of Shares to require payment of fair cash value of their
Shares, in accordance with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (such Shares, "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(i)_, but shall
instead be converted into the right to payment of such consideration as may be
determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder in accordance with
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Dissenting
Shareholder fails to perfect, withdraws, or otherwise loses such Dissenting
Shareholders right to payment of fair cash value pursuant to Section 1701.85
of the OGCL with respect to such Shares, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, such Shares shall be deemed not to
be Dissenting Shares and shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share,
without interest and subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.02_ and  _Section_ __ _
2.05_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served on the Company pursuant to Section 1701.85 of
the OGCL. Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal of Shares.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

withhold with respect to the making of such payment, or the vesting, waiver
of restrictions or other actions provided for in this Agreement, under the

representatives) deduct or withhold any amount under Section 1445 of the Code
so long as the Company provides the certification and notice described in
_Section_ __ _ 5.18_. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld
by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent (or their affiliates
or representatives), as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts
(a) shall be remitted by the applicable withholding agent to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options, Stock
Unit Awards or Restricted Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be.

Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has
either received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its
qualified status or may rely upon a favorable opinion letter for a prototype
or volume submitter plan, and to the knowledge of the Company, no
circumstances or events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of such plan.

which has or may be provided under a Company Benefit Plan to any current or
former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code)
would reasonably be expected to be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has any obligation to pay a Tax gross-up or otherwise
reimburse or compensate any Person for any Tax-related payments under Section

(a) _Section_ __ _ 4.07(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains the
audited, consolidated financial statements of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries consisting of the audited consolidated balance sheet of Parent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 and

and (ii) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries and the results of their operations,

periods referred to therein (except in the case of interim financial
statements, they do not contain notes and are subject to normal year-end
adjustments or (in the case of the unaudited financial statements for the six
(6)-month period ending December 31, 2018) adjustments resulting from the
audit of such unaudited financial statements, in each case, that are not

35

    

(b) To Parents knowledge, no "material weaknesses" (as such terms
are defined in Rule 1-02(a)(4) of Regulation S-X) in the design or operation
of internal controls over Parents financial reporting were identified in
connection with the audit of its financial statements for the period ended
June 30, 2018, that could adversely affect in any material respect Parents
ability to timely record, process, summarize and report financial information.

 

Section 4.08 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has, or is subject to, any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP

2018 or in the notes thereto, (b) incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2018, (c) incurred
or permitted to be incurred under this Agreement or incurred in connection
with the Transactions (but only to the extent permitted by this Agreement),
(d) that have been discharged or paid in full or (e) that otherwise would

materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 

Section 4.09 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) the
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Equity
Commitment Letter_ "), among Parent and the other party thereto (the " _Equity
Financing Source_ "), pursuant to which the Equity Financing Source has
committed, subject only to the terms thereof, to invest the amounts set forth
therein on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 1.02_ and to which the Company is an express third-party beneficiary (the "
_Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) the executed commitment letter (together with
the term sheet and any other annexes, exhibits, schedules and other
attachments thereto), dated as of the date hereof (the " _Debt Commitment
Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Financing
Commitments_ ") among Parent and the financial institutions identified therein
(the " _Lenders_ " and, together with the Equity Financing Source, the "
_Financing Sources_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed, subject
only to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth
therein for purposes of funding the Transactions on the date on which the
Closing should occur pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ (the " _Debt
Financing_ " and, together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ ").
Parent has also delivered to the Company true and complete copies of any and
all fee letter(s) (with only the fee amounts and economic terms (including
economic flex terms) (none of which individually or in the aggregate would
reduce the amount of the Debt Financing below an amount necessary (together
with the Equity Financing) to satisfy the Financing Uses, adversely affect
the availability of the Debt Financing or delay or prevent the Closing or make
the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur) redacted) relating to
the Debt Commitment Letter (any such fee letter, a " _Fee Letter_ ").

(b) Assuming the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ and that the Financing is
funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments, the aggregate net
proceeds from the Financing when funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitments are sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided
by Parent or Sub for the consummation of the Transactions and are sufficient
for the satisfaction of all of the 

 



36

    

 obligations of Parent and Sub at the Closing under this Agreement, including
the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, the amounts payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ and the payment of all costs and expenses
of the Transactions (including any obligations of the Surviving Corporation
and the Company Subsidiaries) which become due or payable by the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary in connection with, or as a result of,
the Transactions and any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness required in
connection therewith (including as required by any of the Financing
Commitments) (collectively, the " _Financing Uses_ ").

(c) As of the date hereof, (i) all of the Financing Commitments are in full
force and effect and have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded or,
except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ after the date hereof, otherwise
amended, supplemented or modified (or contemplated to be amended, supplemented
or modified) in each case by Parent, or to the knowledge of Parent, any other
party thereto in any respect, (ii) each of the Financing Commitments, in the
form delivered to the Company, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent, Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
enforceable against such parties in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, (iii) there are no side letters or other
Contracts or arrangements (except for any Fee Letters, any fee credit or
discount letters and engagement letters) with respect to the Debt Financing
relating to the Financing Commitments among the parties thereto that would add
any condition precedent to funding of the Debt Financing, reduce the
amount of the Debt Financing below an amount necessary (together with the
Equity Financing) to satisfy the Financing Uses, adversely affect the
availability of the Debt Financing or delay or prevent the Closing or make the
funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur and (iv) no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any term, or a
failure of any condition, of the Financing Commitments or otherwise result in
the aggregate amount of the Financing being unavailable on the date on which
the Closing should occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.02_. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_ and compliance by the Company with _Section_ __ _
5.07_, Parent has no reason to believe that it or any Equity Financing Source
or Lender would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition
of the Financing Commitments required to be satisfied by it. Parent and Sub
have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. As
of the date hereof, (i) there are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments (collectively, the " _Disclosed Conditions_ "), and (ii) no person
has any right to impose, and none of Parent or any counterparty to any
Financing Commitment has any obligation to accept (1) any condition precedent
to such funding, other than the Disclosed Conditions, (2) any reduction to the
aggregate amount available under the Financing Commitments on the Closing Date
below an amount necessary to satisfy the Financing Uses or (3) any term of
condition that would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount
available under the Financing Commitments on the Closing Date below an amount
necessary to satisfy the Financing Uses. Parent affirms that it is not
a condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this
Agreement that Parent and/or any of its affiliates obtain financing for or
related to any of the Transactions.

 



37

    

(d) Neither Parent nor Sub has, directly or indirectly, entered into an
exclusivity, lock-up or other similar agreement, arrangement or binding
understanding with any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of
debt or equity financing that prohibits such provider from providing or
seeking to provide any services or financing, including debt or equity
financing, to any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries (including in connection with the making
of any Competing Proposal) in connection with the Transactions.

Section 4.10 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and Sub have caused the Guarantor to deliver the Guarantee, dated as

Agreement, (i) the Guarantee is in full force and effect and has not been
withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any
respect, (ii) the Guarantee is a legal and valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and (iii) no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
constitute a default or breach on the part of the Guarantor under the
Guarantee.

 

Section 4.11 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission for which the Company
could be responsible in connection with the Transactions based on arrangements
made by or on behalf of Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates,
other than those that become payable by the Surviving Corporation following
the consummation of the Merger.

Section 4.12 _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation
of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived, (b)
the most recent financial statements included in a Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q or an Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition
of the Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the end of the
periods covered thereby and the consolidated results of operations of the
Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries for the periods covered
thereby in accordance with GAAP and (c) any estimates, projections or
forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been prepared by them in
good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable,
then at and immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect
to all of the Transactions, including the funding of the Debt Financing and
the Financing Uses and the Merger, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each
Subsidiary of Parent and Surviving Corporation, taken as a whole, will be
Solvent. As of the date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries, on
a consolidated basis, are Solvent. Parent and Sub are not entering into the
Transactions with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of Parent (or any of its subsidiaries), Sub, the Company
or any Company Subsidiary.

of the Parent Credit Agreement, the Parent Indenture and the form of notes
issued under the Parent Indenture, and all amendments to each of them, have
been provided to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the
date hereof, there is no Default or Event of Default under the Parent Credit
Agreement or the Parent Indenture (as such terms are defined in the Parent
Credit Agreement and Parent Indenture, as applicable).

 



38

    

Section 4.14 _Absence of Certain Arrangements_. Other than this Agreement and
the Voting Agreements, as of the date hereof, there are no Contracts or any
commitments to enter into any Contract between Parent, Sub or any of their
respective controlled affiliates, on the one hand, and any director, officer,
employee or shareholder of the Company, on the other hand, relating to the
Transactions or the operations of the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of
its affiliates has entered into any Contract or any commitments to enter into
any Contract pursuant to which: (i) any shareholder of the Company would be
entitled to receive consideration for its Shares of a different amount or
nature than provided pursuant to this Agreement, or (ii) any shareholder of
the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or approve the Merger or
agrees to vote against any Competing Proposal (except for the Voting
Agreements delivered concurrently with the execution of this Agreement).

Without limiting the representations and warranties contained in _Article_ __
_ III_ or any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _

or constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing
Proposal, except in the case of this _clause (D_ ) following receipt of a
Competing Proposal that satisfies _clauses (i_ ) and ( _ii_ ) of _Section_ __
_ 5.03(b)_ to the extent that such failure to take such actions would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) under applicable Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the last sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(b)_, if, at any
time following the date of this Agreement and prior to receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, (i) the Company receives a written Competing Proposal
that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) believes to be _bona_ __ _
fide_ and such written Competing Proposal did not result from a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.03_, and (ii) the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal from the same
person making such Competing Proposal, then the Company may, only following
the execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the person
making such Competing Proposal, (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Competing
Proposal and its representatives and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Competing Proposal and its
representatives regarding such Competing Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the Company will (x) as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
48 hours) notify Parent of the receipt of any Competing Proposal that
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, including the identity of any person making such Competing Proposal
and the material terms thereof, (y) furnish to Parent a true and correct copy
of any confidentiality or other agreement entered into with such person and
(z) as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after
providing material) provide to Parent any material information concerning the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other
person (or its representatives) that was not previously provided or made
available to Parent. None of the foregoing provisions of _Section_ __ _
5.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.03(b)_ shall prohibit the Company or the Company
Representatives from communicating with any person or group of persons that
has made a Competing Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not
result from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ solely to request the
clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether
the Competing Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal, and any such communications, to the extent limited to
such purpose, shall not be a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.03_; provided
that the Company has first provided Parent written notice of the Competing
Proposal (and such anticipated effort to seek clarification).

 

(c) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ or _Section_ __ _
5.03(e)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
adopt, authorize, approve, endorse, declare advisable or recommend to the
shareholders of the Company (or publicly propose to adopt, authorize, approve,
endorse, declare advisable or recommend to the shareholders of the Company),
any Competing Proposal, (ii) withhold, modify, amend, change, qualify or
withdraw, or publicly propose to withhold, modify, amend, change, qualify or
withdraw, in a manner adverse to Parent 

 



45

    

 or Sub, the Company Recommendation or fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) allow, authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any
agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, term
sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement to effect
any Competing Proposal with the person that made such Competing Proposal
(other than, solely when permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.03(b)_, an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement), or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Transactions (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_
") or (iv) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (any action set forth
in the foregoing  _clauses_ __ _ (i)(iv)_, a " _Change of Company
Recommendation_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but
subject to prior compliance with the provisions set forth below), at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) may make a Change of Company Recommendation (and, if
so desired by the Company Board), terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(f)_ in order to cause the Company to concurrently enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal if, but only
if, prior to taking any such action:

(i) (A) a _bona fide_ written Competing Proposal (that did not result from a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_) is made to the Company by a third person
after the date of this Agreement and such Competing Proposal is not withdrawn
and (B) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that (I) such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(II) the failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation in connection
with such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 

(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the intention of the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) to make a Change of Company
Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal (a " _Notice of Change of
Recommendation_ ") at least three (3) Business Days in advance of taking any
such action, which notice shall include the material terms and conditions of
the Superior Proposal and copies of the proposed transaction documents in
respect of such Competing Proposal, including the identity of the person
making such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that neither the delivery of
the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company nor any public
disclosure thereof shall constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

 

(iii) if requested by Parent, the Company has negotiated, and caused any
applicable Company Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent
with respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing
Commitments and the Guarantee proposed by Parent in a written binding offer,
for at least three (3) Business Days following receipt by Parent of such
Notice of Change of Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to any material term of the Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Change of Recommendation and an additional two (2) Business Day
period from the date of such notice), and during each such period, the
Company Board has considered in good faith any such proposed changes by
Parent; and

 



46

    

(iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement,
the Financing Commitments and the Guarantee offered by Parent in a binding
irrevocable written offer to the Company pursuant to _clause_ _(iii_ ) above,
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Competing Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal
if such changes irrevocably offered in writing by Parent were to be given
effect.

 

(e) Other than in connection with a Competing Proposal (which shall be subject
to _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section_ __ _
5.03(e)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) from effecting a Change of Company
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to
effect a Change of Company Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that
the Company shall give Parent at least three (3) Business Days of such
determination and the intention of the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably
detailed description of the basis for such Change of Company Recommendation
(it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by the Company nor
any public disclosure thereof shall constitute a Change of Company
Recommendation).

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ shall prohibit
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) from (i) disclosing to the
shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt,
it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure
of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Company
Recommendation). Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this  _Section_ __ _
5.03(f)_ will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) to effect a Change of Company Recommendation other than in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(e)_.

Section 5.04 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Shareholder
Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall (i) prepare and file a preliminary
Proxy Statement with the SEC and (ii) in consultation with Parent, set a
record date for the Company Shareholder Meeting and commence a broker search
pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith.
Parent shall cooperate with the Company, as reasonably requested, in the
preparation of the Proxy

 



47

    

 Statement and shall furnish all information concerning Parent, Sub, the
Guarantor and any of their affiliates and any transaction any of them have or
are contemplating entering into in connection with this Agreement that is
reasonably requested by the Company or the Companys outside legal counsel and
necessary or appropriate in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after
such filing, including responding as promptly as practicable to any comments
made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or any related documents (or in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall
consider in good faith any comments on such document or response reasonably
proposed by Parent. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of
any comments to the Proxy Statement from the SEC or its staff and of any
request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Proxy Statement or the Transactions.

(b) The Company shall cause (and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
within five (5) Business Days) the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company as of the record date
established for the Company Shareholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable after confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that
it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement (the " _Proxy Clearance_
").

(c) If, at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, any information
relating to the Company or Parent, Sub, the Guarantor, any of their affiliates
or any transaction any of them have or are contemplating entering into in
connection with this Agreement, is discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall as promptly as practicable notify the other party. Following such
notification, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC an appropriate
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such information as
promptly as reasonably practicable after Parent has had a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, the Company shall
disseminate such amendment or supplement to the shareholders of the Company.

 

(d) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after (and shall
use reasonable best efforts to do the following within thirty (30) Business
Days after) the Proxy Clearance, in accordance with Law and the Company
Charter and the Company Code, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company Shareholder Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder Approval.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the Company may adjourn, recess or postpone the Company Shareholder Meeting,
and may change the record date thereof in connection such postponement, solely
(i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, to ensure that any required

 



48

    

 supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
shareholders of the Company a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Company Shareholder Meeting or (ii) if as of the time for which the Company
Shareholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Shareholder Meeting or to the extent that
at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholder
Meeting. The obligation of the Company to establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting shall
not be affected by a Change of Company Recommendation unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.01(f)_.

(f) The Company, through the Company Board, shall (i) except in the case of a
Change of Company Recommendation permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.03(e)_, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the
holders of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the Company Shareholder
Approval in accordance with the OGCL, (ii) submit this Agreement for adoption
by the shareholders of the Company and (iii) except in the case of a Change of
Company Recommendation permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ or _Section_ __
_ 5.03(e)_, recommend to the shareholders of the Company that they adopt this
Agreement and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

 

Section 5.05 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
to: (a) provide to Parent, Sub and their respective representatives, including
Parents financing sources, reasonable access during normal business hours in
such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of any
business conducted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, upon reasonable
prior written notice to the Company, to the officers, employees, personnel,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and to the books, Tax Returns, records, files and
Contracts thereof; and (b) furnish promptly such information, books, Tax
Returns, records, files and Contracts concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as
Parent, Sub and their respective representatives may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to
cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such
information to the extent that the Company reasonably believes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel) that doing so would: (i) result
in the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner
that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); (ii) violate any
confidentiality obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
third person or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party; or (iii)
breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law (including privacy laws and
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law) (provided that the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access or make such
disclosure in a manner that does not result in the events set out in _clauses
(i_ ) through ( _iii_ ) above). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event
that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on
_clauses (i_ ) through ( _iii_ ) above, the Company shall provide Parent with
a list of the information that is being withheld. Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives,
to hold all information provided or

 



49

    

 furnished pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_ confidential in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that Parent and Sub
will be permitted to disclose such information to any Lender or prospective
Lenders that may become parties to the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to
their respective representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , that any Lender or
prospective Lender (and, in each case, their respective representatives) that
is disclosed, furnished or provided such information pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.05_ shall be considered a "Representative," as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement. During any visit to the business or property
sites of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each of Parent and
Sub shall, and shall cause their respective representatives accessing such
properties to, comply with all applicable Laws and all of the Companys and
the Company Subsidiaries safety and security procedures that have been
provided upon arrival or in advance to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, none of Parent, Sub or any of their
respective affiliates shall conduct any environmental sampling or other
intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or other
environmental media at or in connection with any of such real property owned
or leased by the Company. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent one or more CDs containing (in a
readable and otherwise reasonably acceptable format) complete and accurate
copies of (A) the contents of the Companys virtual data room established at

Merger (the " _Data Room_ ") as at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 23,
2019, and (B) separately identified, each document added to the Data Room
after such time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in lieu of delivering the CD

time.

consummate and cause the Financing Sources to fund (including funding the
Bridge Facility (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) to the extent
Notes (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) have not then been issued),
the Financing at or prior to Closing and (iv) in the event that all of the
Disclosed Conditions have been satisfied (or with the funding of the
Financing, would be concurrently satisfied) or waived, enforce their rights
under the Financing Commitments and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements.
Parent and Sub shall not agree to any amendments, restatements, supplements
or modifications to or replacements of, or grant any waivers of, any
condition or other provision under the Financing Commitments or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing without the prior written consent of the
Company other than amendments, restatements, supplements, modifications,
replacements or waivers to the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements if such amendment, modification or waiver would not (and
would not be reasonably expected to) (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing or Equity Financing (including as a result of changing

 



52

    

 the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt
Financing or similar fee) unless (I) in the case of any reduction in the
amount of the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount or (II) the aggregate amount of the Financing would still
be sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses, (B) impose new or additional
conditions, amend or modify any of the Disclosed Conditions in any manner
materially adverse to the interests of the Company, or otherwise expand any
conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing, (C)
delay or prevent the Closing beyond the date the Closing is required to be
effected in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.02_, (D) make the funding of the
Debt Financing or the Equity Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining any of the Financing) less likely to occur or (E) adversely impact
the ability of Parent or Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements or the ability of Parent or Sub
to timely consummate the Transactions; provided that the foregoing
restrictions shall not apply to the implementation of any "flex" provisions
under the Debt Commitment Letter or any Fee Letter as in effect on the date
hereof;  _provided_ , _further_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent
may also amend (or amend and restate) any Debt Commitment Letter, Fee Letters
and any fee credit or discount and engagement letters or any Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or any person with similar roles or titles who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and amend titles, allocations and
fee sharing arrangements with respect to the existing and additional lenders,
arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities) in all material
respects in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date hereof; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Parent shall
provide the Company executed copies thereof in accordance with _clause (d_ )
below. Upon any such replacement, amendment, supplement or other modification
of, or waiver under, the Equity Commitment Letter or Debt Commitment Letter
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_, the term "Equity Commitment
Letter" or "Debt Commitment Letter," as applicable, shall mean such Commitment
Letter as so replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or waived (and
consequently the terms "Debt Financing," "Equity Financing" and "Financing"
shall mean the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing contemplated by such
Commitment Letters as so replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or
waived). Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain in
effect the Financing Commitments (including any Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements) until the Transactions are consummated (subject to Parents and
Subs right to replace, restate, supplement, modify, assign, substitute,
waiver or amend the Financing Commitments and the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements in accordance herewith), provided that such efforts shall not
require any modification of, or waiver of any rights under, the Financing
Commitments, or any payment or other concession that would not be required
under the existing terms of the Financing Commitments (including any
"flex" provisions) if the applicable Financing was consummated in accordance
with its terms prior to the expiration of the applicable Financing Commitment.
Neither Parent nor Sub shall release, or consent to the termination (other
than by the Lenders in accordance with its terms as of the date hereof) of,
the obligations of the Lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Parent or any of its affiliates (which for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.07(b)_ shall be deemed to include Guarantor and its
affiliates) engage any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of
debt or equity financing on an exclusive basis or otherwise on terms
that prohibit or

 



53

    

 are designed to prevent such provider from providing or seeking to provide
such services or financing to any person in connection with a transaction
relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the
Transactions (including in connection with the making of any Competing
Proposal).

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter, Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, arrange
and obtain from alternative sources of debt financing an amount sufficient
(when added to the Equity Financing) to satisfy the Financing Uses, on terms
and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that are (i) no less
favorable in any material respect to Parent or the Company as those contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "flex" term applicable thereto)
or (ii) otherwise acceptable to Parent, which, in each case, shall not expand
upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the Closing
Date of the Financing as set forth in the Financing Commitments in effect on
the date hereof. The new debt commitment letter and fee letter entered into
in connection with such alternative financing are referred to, respectively,
as a " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ " and a " _New Fee Letter_." In the event
Parent or Sub enter into any such New Debt Commitment Letter, (i) Parent and
Sub shall promptly provide the Company with true, correct and complete copies
thereof (provided that the New Fee Letter may be redacted in a manner
consistent with the Fee Letter provided as of the date hereof), (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the " _Debt Financing_ " shall mean the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to
_clause_ __ _ (iii_) below, and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to the
" _Debt Commitment Letter_ " (and any definition incorporating the term "
_Debt_ __ _ Commitment Letter_," including the definition of Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements) shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letter and any Fee Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter, as the case may be, at the time in
question and any New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter to the extent
then in effect.

(d) Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their representatives to, keep
the Company reasonably informed of material developments in their efforts to
arrange the Financing and provide copies of all draft financing documents
related to the Debt Financing to the Company as may be reasonably requested by
the Company in writing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies of
any amendments, restatements, modifications or supplements to, or replacements
or waivers of, the Financing Commitments promptly (but in any event within
two (2) Business Days) upon their execution and (ii) give the Company prompt
written notice (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) (A) of any
material default or breach by any party under any of the Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing of which
Parent or Sub becomes aware, (B) of any termination of any of the Financing
Commitments, (C) of the receipt of any written notice from any Equity
Financing Source or Lender with respect to any (1) actual or potential
default, breach, termination or repudiation of any Financing Commitment, any
definitive agreement relating to the Financing or any material provision of
the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (2) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded
at the Closing (and, for the

 



54

    

 avoidance of doubt, other than those relating to the ordinary course
negotiation of the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements), and (D) if for any
reason Parent or Sub believe in good faith that they will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the aggregate amount of the Financing necessary
to satisfy the Financing Uses on the terms or in the manner contemplated by
the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing, as the case may be.

(e) Prior to the Closing, subject to Parents expense reimbursement
obligations set forth below, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and instruct the Company representatives to, in each case, use
their reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Sub all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) cause management of the Company
to prepare for and participate in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, sessions with rating agencies, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions, road shows, lender meetings and other customary
syndication activities, in each case, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, at reasonable times and on reasonable notice, (ii) provide
reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, offering documents,
offering memoranda and similar customary documents reasonably required in the
Debt Financing, including the execution and delivery of
customary authorization letters related thereto (including customary
representations (solely with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) with respect to the absence of material non-public information
in the public-side version of documents distributed to potential lenders and
the absence of material misstatements) and provide reasonable cooperation with
the due diligence efforts of the Debt Financing Sources to the extent
reasonable and customary (and, to the extent applicable, subject to the
limitations contained in _Section_ __ _ 5.05_ hereof), (iii) (A) obtain
documents reasonably requested by Parent or the Lenders relating to the
repayment of the Senior Credit Facility and the release on the Closing Date
of related liens, including the Payoff Letter and (B) provide as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event, no less than four (4) business days
prior to the Closing Date) all documentation and other information required
by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations, including (1) the USA PATRIOT Act and
(2) if applicable, a certification regarding beneficial ownership as required
by 31 C.F.R. §1010.230 to any Debt Financing Source that has requested such
certification, relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in
each case as reasonably requested by Parent or the Lenders at least nine (9)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (iv) furnish Parent and Sub and the
Lenders as promptly as reasonably practicable (or in the case of _clause (2_ )
as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event, more than 15 Business
Days after the end of the relevant quarter) with (1) the Required Information,
(2) customary "flash" or "recent development" revenue information (which may
be provided in a reasonable range or estimate and may be provided on a non-
GAAP basis) for any fiscal quarter ending after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing, and (3) such other financial and other pertinent information
pertaining to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (it being understood
that the Company shall not be required to provide (a) any financial statements
other than the Target Financial Statements (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof) and the Constantia Financial
Statements or (b) any information specified as excluded from the definition of
the Required Information pursuant to clauses (a), (b) or (c) of the proviso
contained therein; (v) cooperate to facilitate the pledging of, granting of
security interests in and obtaining perfection of any liens on, collateral
(including, to the extent the delivery thereof is not covered by the Payoff
Letter, 

 



55

    

 using reasonable best efforts to deliver original copies of all certificated
securities and instruments (with transfer powers executed in blank) required
to be provided as Collateral under the Debt Commitment Letter), and cooperate
with any collateral appraisals and field examinations as may be reasonably
requested by the Parent and the Lenders; (vi) cause the independent auditors
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to assist and cooperate with
Parent in connection with the Debt Financing, including by (A) providing
consent to offering memoranda that include or incorporate the Companys
consolidated financial statements and their reports thereon, and
customary comfort letters (including "negative assurance" and change period
comfort) with respect to financial information relating to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and (B) attending accounting due diligence sessions in
connection with the Debt Financing; (vii) execute and deliver financing
agreements and such pledge and security and related documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent or the Lenders; (viii) establish bank and other
accounts and blocked account agreements and lock-box arrangements to the
extent necessary in connection with the Debt Financing; (ix) execute and
deliver any certificates as may be reasonably requested by Parent (other
than as to solvency matters) with respect to certain financial information in
the offering documents not otherwise covered by "comfort" letters described
above so long as such certificate does not relate to (I) any financial
information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries does not maintain in the ordinary course
of business or (II) any other information not reasonably available to the
Company under its current reporting systems; and (x) take all corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested
by Parent that are necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the
Debt Financing, including any high yield financing, and to permit the
proceeds thereof, to be made available on the Closing Date to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the contrary, (1) in no event shall the "reasonable best efforts"
of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or Company representatives be deemed
or construed to require such Persons to, and such Persons shall not be
required to provide such cooperation to the extent it would (A) interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or (B) require the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected to (x)
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the Company Charter or
Company Code or other comparable organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries, or any applicable Laws or any Material Contract, (y) cause any
condition to Closing set forth in this Agreement to fail to be satisfied
or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement that would provide Parent or
Sub the right to terminate this Agreement (unless, in each case, waived by
Parent, Sub and the Lenders), or (z) result in any employee, officer or
director of such Person incurring any personal liability (as opposed to
liability in his or her capacity as an officer of such Person) with respect to
any matters related to the Debt Financing; (2) neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to execute and deliver any
Contract or other instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing or that
would be effective prior to the Effective Time (other than the provision of
the authorization letter and certificates to provide comfort referred to in
_clause (ix_ ) above and "know-your-customer" information referred to in
_clause (iii_ ) above); (3) neither the Company Board nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) shall be required to
approve or adopt any Financing or agreements related thereto (or any
alternative financing) that would be

 



56

    

 effective prior to the Effective Time, and no person who will not be a
director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately after the
Effective Time shall be required to take any action pursuant to this _clause
(3_ ); (4) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required to execute or deliver any agreements, certificates or instruments in
connection with any Financing (or any alternative financing) at or prior to
the Effective Time (other than customary authorization or representation
letters and "know-your-customer" information noted above); (5) neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be responsible for the
preparation of any pro forma financial statements or any adjustments to any
pro forma financial information required to be provided in accordance with the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Companys reasonable best efforts to
provide assistance, if requested, in connection with pro forma financial
information shall be limited to providing financial information reasonably
available to the Company under its current reporting systems; (6) neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than for
reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses that are reimbursed by Parent as
provided below in this _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_) or incur any other liability
or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing
or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time; (7) nothing contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_ or otherwise shall require the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, prior to the Effective Time, to be an issuer or
other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing and (8) nothing contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_ shall require (A) any officer or representative
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate
or opinion or take any other action under this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ that
could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer
or representative or (B) any person who will not be an officer of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary immediately after the Effective Time to execute or
deliver any certificate, document, agreement or other instrument pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ if such certificate, document, agreement or other
instrument will only become effective on or after the Effective Time. The
Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or
otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall not be deemed to
have breached this _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_ as it relates to the condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_ unless the Financing (or any alternative
financing) has not been obtained primarily as a result of the Companys or
any of the Company Subsidiaries willful and material breach of their
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_. Parent shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company, any of
the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Companys representatives in
connection with such cooperation; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required
to reimburse the Company or any of the Companys representatives for any costs
and expenses incurred by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any
of the Companys representatives with respect to the financial statements,
financial information or other materials (a) prepared prior to the date hereof
that may be used in connection with the Debt Financing (it being understood
that this _clause (a_ ) shall not exclude the fees and expenses of the
Companys auditors, accountants and counsel in providing the assistance or
comfort required by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_) and (b) prepared after
the date hereof in connection with the Proxy Statement or the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act (it being understood that this clause (b)
shall not exclude the 

 



57

    

 fees and expenses of the Companys auditors, accountants and counsel in
providing the assistance or comfort required by clause (ii) or (vi) of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_) and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than historical information provided in writing by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection
therewith); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments or penalties are determined by a final, non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from
the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or the Company representatives.

(f) Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining
of the Financing or any alternative financing is a condition to the Closing,
and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing or any alternative
financing, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_.

 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations contained in this _Section_ __
_ 5.07_ (other than the last two sentences of  _Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_)
shall terminate upon the occurrence of the Closing.

Section __ 5.08 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall be
a joint press release, the contents of which have received prior approval from
both such parties, and thereafter, until the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other, including providing reasonable
opportunity to review and comment, before issuing any broadly-disseminated,
generally applicable employee communication, press release or public
statement with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press
release, employee communication or public statement prior to such consultation
with the other party; _provided_ , that the restrictions set forth in this 
_Section 5.08_ shall not apply to any press release, employee communication,
public statement or other announcement issued or made, or proposed to be
issued or made, by (a) the Company in connection with a Competing Proposal or
Change of Company Recommendation, (b) the Company as may be required by
applicable Law, the fiduciary duties of the Company Board or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in
each case, subject to the conditions set forth in _Section 5.03_ or (c)
Parent, Sub or the Company that is consistent in all material respects with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by a
party hereto in accordance with this Section 5.08, including investor
conference calls, filings with the SEC, QandAs or other publicly disclosed
documents, in each case under this _clause (c)_ to the extent such disclosure
is still accurate. Nothing in this  _Section 5.08_ shall limit the ability
of the Company to make any internal announcements to its employees that are
consistent in all material respects with the employee communications, press
releases or public statements regarding the Transactions made by a party
hereto in accordance with this _Section 5.08_. Nothing in this _Section
5.08_ shall restrict or prohibit Parent or any of its affiliates from making
any (i) customary announcement or other communication in connection

 



58

    

 with the arrangement of the Financing (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, such announcement or communications that Parent reasonably determines
in good faith are required to ensure that any document concerning the
Financing does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are made), or (ii) any
disclosures regarding the Company in connection with the Financing to the
extent that such disclosure is of the type and nature previously disclosed by
the Company to investors in its securities. For the avoidance of doubt, any
public filings providing notice to or seeking approval from any Governmental
Entity made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ shall be governed by _Section_
__ _ 5.06_ and not this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_. 

Section 5.09 _Directors_ __ _ and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) _ Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent (x) permitted by
applicable Law and (y) provided for in the Company Charter, the Company Code
or the equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, in each
case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each current or former director or officer of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively,
the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) all losses, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages or
liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding sentence,
amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on or arise out
of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or
fiduciary under benefit plans or performed services at the request of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Liabilities_
"), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or
arise out of or pertain to the Transactions, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred
in enforcing such persons rights under this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_. In the
event of any such Indemnified Liability (whether or not asserted before the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly after
statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified
Party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred (
_provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is
not legally entitled to indemnification under Law).

 

(b) _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective
Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium (which premium shall not
exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the amount of the annual premiums paid
by the Company for the current year (the " _Premium Cap_ ")) for an insurance
and indemnification policy that provides coverage with respect to Indemnified
Liabilities for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_")
that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate to the intended beneficiaries thereof than the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance policy. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policy as of the

 



59

    

 Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long
thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six (6)-year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of
this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that in the event the annual
costs of such a policy would exceed the Premium Cap, then on
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that provide the best
coverage as is then available at a cost up to, but not exceeding, the Premium
Cap), or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6)-year
period (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of
such six-year period thereunder are being adjudicated) with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement ( _provided_ that in the event the annual costs of such a
policy would exceed the Premium Cap, then on terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that provide the best coverage as is then available at
a cost up to, but not exceeding, the Premium Cap).

 

(c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, require such
successors, assigns or transferees of the Surviving Corporation or Parent to
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_.

 

(d) _Continuation_. For not less than six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, to the extent consistent with applicable Law, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to ensure that the articles of
incorporation and the code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation and the
articles of incorporation, code of regulations, bylaws or any
equivalent organizational or governing documents of each Company Subsidiary
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for periods at or prior to the
Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Charter, the
Company Code or the equivalent organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary. The contractual indemnification rights, if any, in existence on
the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

 

(e) _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, each
Indemnified Partys heirs, executors or administrators and each Indemnified
Partys representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended in
a manner that is materially adverse to any Indemnified Parties (including
their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified
Party (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

 



60

    

(f) _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.
Nothing in this Agreement, including this  _Section_ __ _ 5.09_, is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or
the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_ is not prior to, or
in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

Section 5.10 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use all reasonable efforts
(a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to restrict or prohibit the Transactions and (b) if any Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the
Transactions, to take all action necessary, including granting approvals, so
that such Transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize (to the greatest extent practicable) the effects of such Takeover
Statute on such Transaction.

Section 5.11 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefit Protection Period_ "),
Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to provide, during any period of employment with the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or their affiliates, (i) base salary, base wages or
commission opportunities to each individual who is an employee of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Company_ __ _ Employee_") in each case at a rate that is no less than the
rate of base salary, base wages or commission opportunities provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual
target cash bonus opportunity (excluding equity based compensation,
retention, long-term incentive, change in control or transaction based bonus
plans, arrangements or agreements) to each Company Employee that is a
participant in the MIP or SIP that is not less than such Company Employees
Specified Target Bonus under the MIP or SIP, if any, and (iii) severance
benefits to each Company Employee in the United States that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits provided under any severance plan,
policy or agreement in effect for the benefit of such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which in the case of U.S. employees,
is set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and
(iv) other compensation and benefits (including paid-time off but excluding
annual cash bonus opportunities, equity-based compensation, non-qualified
deferred compensation, supplemental retirement benefits, defined benefit
pensions, retiree medical benefits or any long-term incentive, retention,
transaction, change in control or similar bonus plans, agreements or

bonus opportunities, equity-based compensation, non-qualified deferred
compensation, supplemental retirement benefits, defined benefit pensions,

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to honor all of the Companys and the
Company Subsidiaries legally binding employment, severance, retention and
termination plans, agreements and arrangements (including any change in
control or severance agreement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and any Company Employee), in each case, in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to any
payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either
alone or in combination with any other event).

 

(c) For purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any "employee benefit
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without regard
to whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any other employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, (ii) providing
benefits to Company Employees (other than under any defined benefit pension,
retiree medical, non-qualified deferred compensation or similar plans or
arrangements) and (iii) accrual of benefits under any vacation, paid time off
and severance plans, each Company Employees service with or otherwise
credited by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service
with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled immediately prior to
the Closing to credit for such service under a comparable Company Benefit
Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount
of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such years
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which such Company Employee (and dependents) will be eligible
to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(e) Provided that Parent provides the Company written notice at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall terminate any or all Company Benefit Plans intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ ") and the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that such
401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors
or managers of the applicable Company or Company Subsidiary, the form of which
shall be subject to review of Parent.

 



62

    

(f) The parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to,
mutually cooperate in undertaking all reasonably necessary or legally
required provision of information to, or consultations, discussions or
negotiations with, employee representative bodies (including any unions or

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the terms and
conditions of employment for any employee covered by a CBA shall continue to

other individual associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee
thereof or any other third person any right to enforce the provisions of this

contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the Company
(including the Company Board) shall take such actions as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities) by any officer or director of
the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act pursuant to or
in connection with the Transactions are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.14 _Defense of Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
of any Proceeding brought by shareholders of the Company against the Company
or its directors or officers arising out of or relating to the Transactions.
The Company shall control, and to the extent reasonably practicable, the
Company shall consult with Parent and keep Parent reasonably informed with

all filings and responses to be made by the Company in connection with such
Proceeding (and the Company shall consider any such comments in good faith);
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not settle any such

conditions thereto have been satisfied or waived by the Company, to execute
supplemental indentures to the Senior Notes Indentures, in form and substance

indentures, subject to execution by the trustee, shall implement, subject to
and conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing and the other conditions set
forth below, the amendments described in such offer document and, subject to
execution by the trustee, shall become operative only upon acceptance of the

utilized in connection therewith (other than historical information provided
in writing by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries specifically for use in
connection therewith);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties are determined in a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company representatives. 

Section 5.17 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the

would not be satisfied;

(f) by the Company, if, concurrently with the termination of this Agreement,
the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that the right of the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.01(f)_ is conditioned on and
subject to (i) the Companys compliance (other than any de minimis non-
compliance) with _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ (including _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_)
and (ii) the prior or concurrent payment to Parent by the Company of the

circumstances under which Parent is not entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(i)_ and (v) with respect to any

71

    

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Sub and the Company
would not enter into this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be required
to pay to Parent more than one Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.02(b)_. In no event shall Parent be required to pay to the Company (x)
more than one Parent Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_ or

provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_, in the event that Parent receives full
payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_
under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee was payable, the receipt
of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
for any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, judgments, inquiries,
fines and fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, suffered or incurred by Parent, Sub or any of their respective
affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the termination of this
Agreement), the Merger and the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination, other than any losses or
damages incurred or suffered by Parent or Sub as a result of the Companys
willful breach. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)(i)_,
_7.02(a)(ii)_ or _7.02(a)(v)_ in the event that the Company receives full
payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_
under circumstances where a Parent Termination Fee was payable, the receipt of
the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for
any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, judgments, inquiries, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, suffered or incurred by the Company or any of its controlled
affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and the Company shall not have, and expressly waives and
relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse (whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, or whether at Law (including at common law or by statute)
or in equity). Each party acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
controlled affiliates, that the payment of the Parent Termination Fee is not a
penalty but instead is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that shall
compensate the Company and its controlled affiliates in the circumstances in
which the Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, (I) in no
event shall the Company be entitled to seek or obtain from any recovery or
judgment under this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantee
in excess of (A) the Parent Termination Fee, plus (B) any unpaid
indemnification or expense reimbursement obligations of Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.07(e)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.16(c)_, plus (C) the amount of
all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
paid or incurred by the Company in enforcing its rights under the Guarantee
against the Guarantor, and (II) in no event shall the Company or any of its
affiliates or holders of Company Common Stock be entitled to seek or obtain
any other damages or other relief of any kind against (A) Parent, (B) Sub, (C)
Guarantor, (D) the Debt Financing Sources or (E) any of their respective
current or former shareholders, partners, members, affiliates, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives
(each, a " _Parent Related Party_ "), including consequential, special,
indirect or punitive damages

  



72

    

 for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Guarantee or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including, any breach by Parent or Sub), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under applicable Law
arising out of any such breach, termination or failure except with respect to
(x) with respect to clause (II), (1) the Companys rights to recover
liabilities or damages for willful breach by Parent or Sub as provided in
Section 7.02(a)(iv) which shall be payable under the Guarantee (subject to the
terms, conditions and limitations thereof) and (2) the Companys rights

the Companys rights against Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC under the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement or the
Super Clean Team Agreement; ___provided_ , _however_ , this  _Section_ __ _
7.02(d)_ shall not limit the right of the parties hereto to specific
performance of this Agreement pursuant to, and subject to the limitations in,
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_ prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms subject to the conditions and limitations thereof;
_provided_ , _further_ , in no event will the Company be entitled to both (x)
the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or damages for willful breach of
Parent and Sub and (y) specific performance of this Agreement.

Section 7.03 _Amendment_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.09(e)_, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) after
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment
that by Law requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company
without the further approval of such shareholders and (ii) no amendment shall
be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time. Except as required by
Law, no amendment of this Agreement by the Company shall require the approval
of the shareholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the sixth sentence of _Section_ __ _
7.02_, _Section_ __ _ 8.05_, _Section_ __ _ 8.06_, the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 8.08(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.08(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.11_
and this sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ may not be modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any material respect to
the Debt Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Lenders
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any person that becomes a party to the
Debt Commitment Letter after the date hereof).

 

Section 7.04 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other,
(b) waive any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of
the other contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other with any of the covenants or
conditions contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, there may not be any
extension or waiver of this Agreement that by Law requires further approval by
the shareholders of the Company without the approval of the Companys
shareholders and (ii) no waiver shall be made under this Agreement after
the Effective Time. Except as required by Law, no extension or waiver by the
Company shall require the approval of the shareholders of the Company. Any
such extension or waiver shall be

 



73

    

 valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or
parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist
on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.

Section 8.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the remedies
and limitations thereon contained in this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _
7.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, shall be construed as an integral provision
of this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not be
severable in any manner that increases a party __ s liability or obligations
hereunder or under the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantee or any Debt
Commitment Letter.

 

Section 8.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Annexes,
Exhibits, Company Disclosure Letter, Parent Disclosure Letter and the other

Confidentiality Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

Section 8.05 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or
transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Sub may without the consent of the
other party (a) assign their rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part,
to an affiliate, (b) collaterally assign their rights under this Agreement to
any of the Debt Financing Sources or any agent or collateral trustee for the
Debt Financing Sources or (c) assign their rights under this Agreement in
connection with any sale or transfer of equity securities of, or any merger,
consolidation, change of control or other business combination involving,
Parent, Sub or any of their Subsidiaries, but in the case of _clause_ __ _
(a_), ( _b_ ), and ( _c_ ) no such assignment will relieve Parent or Sub of
their obligations under this Agreement. Any assignment or transfer in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

Section 8.06 _Parties in Interest_. Except for (a) _ Article_ __ _ II_,
which, after the Closing, shall be for the benefit of any person entitled to
payment thereunder, (b) _ Section_ __ _ 5.09_, which, after the Closing,
shall be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Partys
heirs, executors or administrators and each Indemnified Partys
representatives, (c) _ Section_ __ _ 7.02(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.03_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.05_, this  _Section_ __ _ 8.06_, _Section_ __ _ 8.08_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.11_, which shall be for the benefit of the Parent Related
Parties, and (d) _ Section_ __ _ 5.05_, which shall be for the benefit of
the affiliates of Guarantor that are party to the Confidentiality Agreement,
each of whom identified in _clauses (a_ ) through ( _d_ ), shall be an express
third-party beneficiary of the identified Section of this Agreement, Parent,
Sub and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations,
warranties, agreements and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely
for the benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to
the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does
not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ , that the persons named
in _clause_ __ _ (a_) through ( _d_ ) of this sentence shall be entitled to
enforce their rights under this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree
that the rights of third-party beneficiaries under _clauses_ __ _ (a_)
through ( _d_ ) of the preceding sentence shall not arise unless and until the
Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties may be subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 7.04_ without notice or liability to any other person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debt Financing Sources shall be
third-party beneficiaries of the sixth sentence of _Section_ __ _ 7.02_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.05_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 8.08(b_),
_Section_ __ _ 8.08(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.11_, the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 7.03_ and this sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.06_.

Section 8.07 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation; Headings_. Each party hereto
has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties
hereto. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any provision. For purposes of this
Agreement, whenever the context requires: (a) the singular number shall
include the plural, and vice versa; (b) the masculine gender shall include the
feminine and neuter genders; (c) the feminine gender shall include the
masculine and neuter genders; and (d) the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"
and "including," and words of similar meaning, shall not be deemed to be terms
of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections," "Annexes" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and the Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement.
All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars.
The term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The words "hereof,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this
Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. In this Agreement, references to "as of the date
hereof," "as of the date of this Agreement" or words of similar import shall
be deemed to mean "as of immediately prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement." The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the parties hereto agree that the Financing is the responsibility of Parent
and Sub and not the Company or any Company Subsidiary and that (i) the
Company makes no representations or warranties relating to the Financing
(including whether the Company has authorized the Financing or whether any of
the transactions contemplated by the Financing conflict with or violate any
obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Contract to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party), (ii) except for _Section_ __ _
5.07(e)_, none of the covenants of the Company in this Agreement require the
Company to take any action relating to the Financing and (iii) for purposes of
the representations and warranties and covenants and obligations of the
Company hereunder, the Transactions shall not include the Financing. When a
reference is made in this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter to
information or documents being provided, made available or disclosed to
Parent, Sub or their affiliates, such information or documents shall include
only information or documents (x) contained in the Data Room, but only to the
extent such information or documents were accessible, and identified in the
Data Room index, to Parent as of 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 23, 2019
or (y) described in the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 3.18(a)_; _provided_
, _however_ , that with respect to _Section_ __ _ 3.25_, "made available"
shall include documents transmitted to Parents counsel by electronic mail on
the date of this Agreement.

Section 8.08 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of Law thereof except to the extent the laws of Ohio are mandatorily
applicable to the Merger, which provisions shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Ohio.

 



77

    

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement brought by any other party or its successors or
assigns shall be brought and determined in the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and
with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to
any such Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Transactions except in the
courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by
any such court in Delaware as described in this Agreement. Each of the
parties agrees that notice as provided in this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.02(b_) shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties
further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
(i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
courts in Delaware as described in this Agreement for any reason, (ii) that it
or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the
Proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the
venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject
matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, against
the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof,
in any forum other than (except as may be expressly permitted in any
Debt Commitment Letter) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (and in each case appellate courts thereof).

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING AS IT MAY RELATE TO THE DEBT
FINANCING SOURCES OR THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III)
IT MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 8.08_ _(c)_.

 



78

    

Section 8.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind
the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages
