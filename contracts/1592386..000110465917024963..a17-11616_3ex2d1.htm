 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) Except (1) as otherwise provided in Section 3.1(c) or (2) for Dissenting
Shares (as hereinafter defined), at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Merger Sub
Common Stock or of any Company Capital Stock or Company Warrants:

 



 

(i) each share of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive $20.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "); and

 



 

(ii) pursuant to Section 2.6 of the Warrant Agreement and notwithstanding
anything contained therein to the contrary, at the Effective Time, with
respect to each Company Warrant that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the right of the holder of such Company Warrant to receive
shares of Company Class A Common Stock upon exercise of such Company Warrant
shall thereafter convert to the right of the holder of such Company Warrant to
exercise such Company Warrant to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock
subject to such Company Warrant and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the then-current exercise price per share of Company Class
A Common Stock (without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby) previously subject to such Company Warrant (such amount being
hereafter referred to as the " _Warrant Consideration_ "). The Warrant
Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with
the terms of the Warrant Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. At
the Effective Time, all certificates representing common stock of Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common
stock of the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Capital Stock held by the
Company as treasury stock (other than shares in a Company Plan) or owned by
Parent or Merger Sub (other than shares held in trust accounts, managed
accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties) immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Cancellation of Company Class A Common Stock_. At the Effective
Time, all of the outstanding Company Class A Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist.
Certificates representing such shares of Company Class A Common Stock, if any,
prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Class A Common Stock
were converted in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.1. Holders of Company Class
A Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will, as of the
Effective Time, cease to be, and will have no rights as, stockholders of the
Company, other than rights to receive the Merger Consideration provided under
this Article III.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, (i) each then-outstanding option to purchase
Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company
Stock Option_ ") that is then-unvested or unexercisable shall become
immediately vested and exercisable in full contingent upon the Closing, and
(ii) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and a holder of Company
Stock Options prior to the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options that are
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such
cancelled Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration
of the cancellation of such Company Stock Option and in settlement therefor, a
payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of
shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option (such amount being hereafter referred to as the " _Option
Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
outstanding no Company Stock Options and the former holders thereof shall be
entitled only to the payment of the Option Consideration, if any. Any Company
Stock Option with respect to which the exercise price is greater than or equal
to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, (i) each then-outstanding stock appreciation right
with respect to shares of Company Class A Common Stock granted under the
Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company SAR_ ") that is then-unvested or
unexercisable shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full
contingent upon the Closing, and (ii) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
Parent and a holder of Company SARs prior to the Effective Time, all Company
SARs that are outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of
any such cancelled Company

 



      
 

 



 

SAR shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Company SAR and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal
to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common
Stock subject to such Company SAR and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Class A Common
Stock subject to such Company SAR (such amount being hereafter referred to as
the " _SAR Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, there shall
be outstanding no Company SARs and the former holders thereof shall be
entitled only to the payment of the SAR Consideration, if any. Any Company SAR
with respect to which the exercise price is greater than or equal to the
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time (i) each then-outstanding restricted stock unit with
respect to shares of Company Class A Common Stock outstanding under the
Company Stock Plan (" _RSUs_ ") shall become immediately vested in full
contingent upon the Closing, and (ii) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
the Parent and the holder of such vested RSU prior to the Effective Time each
outstanding vested RSU (including those RSUs that vest by reason of the
consummation of the transaction) shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor,
each holder of any such cancelled Company RSU shall be entitled to receive in
consideration of the cancellation of such Company RSU and in settlement
therefore, a payment in cash of amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock
underlying the cancelled vested RSU.

 



 

(d) The payments described in Sections 3.3(a), (b) and (c) hereof, shall be
paid by the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, and in any event within three (3) Business Days (at Parents option,
through the Companys payroll system or through the Paying Agent (defined
below)). Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation has
an amount in cash sufficient to pay all amounts required by the foregoing
sentence. The Company Board (or appropriate committee thereof) shall pass
resolutions and take all other such action as may be reasonably necessary to
effectuate the treatment of Company Stock Options, Company SARs and RSUs
(collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this
Section 3.3 to the effect that (i) all awards issued under the Company Stock
Plan shall be settled as of the Effective Time as contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) the Company Stock Plan shall be terminated as of the Effective
Time and (iii) neither any holder of Company Equity Awards, nor any other
participant in the Company Stock Plan shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, or
to receive any payment or benefit with respect to any award previously granted
under the Company Stock Plan, except as provided in this Section 3.3.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) At or promptly after (but in no event later than 2 Business Days
following) the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent (subject to the consent, not
to be unreasonably withheld, of the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of (i) certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Class A Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Class A Common
Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), for exchange in accordance with this
Article III, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amounts payable under
Section 3.1(a)(i); provided that such amount shall

 



      
 

 



 

be increased by any amount that shall become payable by the Paying Agent to
the holders of Company Equity Awards pursuant to Parents election under the
first sentence of Section 3.3(d). As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day
following the Effective Time, Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of shares
of Company Class A Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal
and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent) for
use in such exchange. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation or transfer of Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent,
together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Class A Common Stock
formerly represented by any such Certificate and such Certificate so
surrendered and the shares of Company Class A Common Stock formerly
represented by any such Uncertificated Shares shall forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Class A Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled
to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Class A Common Stock represented by a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be,
each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

 



 

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on
the stock transfer books of Company Capital Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with, the procedures set forth
in this Article III.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to (a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company
Class A Common Stock nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be paid,
at the request of Parent, to or as directed by Parent, and any such holder who
has not exchanged shares of Company Class

 



      
 

 



 

A Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
3.4 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, none of the Acquirer Parties, the Company,
the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder or former
holder of shares of Company Class A Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
Company Class A Common Stock shall occur, including as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding for the avoidance of doubt any change that
results from (a) any exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof to
purchase shares of Company Class A Common Stock granted under the Companys
stock option or compensation plans or arrangements, (b) any exercise of
Company Warrants or (c) any vesting of Company Equity Awards, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if required by DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby), shares of Company Class A Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Class A Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c)) and
that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have
properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with,
and who have complied with, Section 262 of DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
will not be convertible into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under DGCL.
If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for,
at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for
payment of the Merger Consideration for such shares. At the Effective Time,
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of DGCL and as provided in
the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisals, withdrawals or attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting
Shares, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations
and

 



      
 

 



 

proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or settle, compromise, offer to settle or
compromise, or otherwise negotiate any such demands.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Withholding_. Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries, and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such
payment under all applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the recipient of the payment in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter (with specific
reference to the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the
information stated in such Company Disclosure Letter relates; _provided_ ,
that (a) the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
the Company that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect and (b) any item on the Company Disclosure Letter in
any one or more sections of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosed with respect to other sections of this Agreement and all other
sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent the
relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face
notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference or (ii) as disclosed
in the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished prior to the date hereof (but
excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section,
in any section relating to forward-looking statements and any other
disclosures included in the Company SEC Documents solely to the extent that
they are generic, cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature, whether
or not appearing in such sections, in each case, other than any statements of
fact set forth in such sections), the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized or formed and validly existing and, except
as would not reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Company
or its Subsidiaries or their respective operations, taken as a whole, is in
good standing (in jurisdictions where applicable) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, (b) has all requisite power
(corporate, company or limited partnership, as the case may be) and authority
to own and operate its property, assets or rights, to lease the property,
assets or rights it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it
is currently engaged, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
material impact on the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective
operations, taken as a whole, and (c) is duly qualified to do business and in
good standing (in jurisdictions where applicable) under the Laws of each
jurisdiction in which its ownership, lease or operation of property, assets or
rights or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to

 



      
 

 



 

have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No jurisdiction, other than those in
which such Person is duly qualified, has claimed in writing that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is required to qualify as a foreign corporation or
other entity therein, except with respect to jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a material impact
on the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective operations, taken as a
whole.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Authorization; No Contravention_. The Company has all requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement has been duly authorized and approved by the Company, and no
corporate, company, limited partnership, stockholder or other action on the
part of the Company is necessary other than the receipt of the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding votes entitled to be cast by the holders
of Company Class A Common Stock, voting together as a single class (the "
_Company Stockholder Approval_ "). Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in Article V of this
Agreement, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the Merger, assuming that the consents, approvals and filings
referred to in Section 4.3 are duly obtained and/or made, do not (i) violate,
conflict with or result in any breach, default or contravention of (or with
due notice or lapse of time or both would result in any breach, default or
contravention of), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or the
creation of any material Lien under, any material Contractual Obligation of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) violate, conflict with or result in any
breach, default or contravention of any organizational document, instrument or
certificate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) violate, conflict
with or result in any breach, default or contravention of any material
Requirement of Law applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iv)
except for expiration or early termination, as the case may be, of all
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, violate any orders, injunctions,
judgments, decrees, determinations of an arbitrator or regulatory restrictions
of any Governmental Authority against, or binding upon, the Company or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, " ** _Orders_** "), except, in the case of clauses
(i) above, for any such violation, conflict, breach, default or contravention
that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably
likely to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Governmental Approvals; Third-Party Consents_. Except for (a)
such filings and notifications as may be required by the HSR Act and, if
necessary, similar competition or Antitrust Laws applicable in the foreign
jurisdictions set forth in _Schedule 4.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
(b) any required consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, the FINRA, the U.K. Financial
Conduct Authority (the " _FCA_ "), the NYSE or any SRO, other Governmental
Authority or third party set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, (c) the filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC, (d) receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, (e) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (f) such filings of reports
under the Exchange Act and as contemplated by the rules of the NYSE, and (g)
any approval, consent, authorization or filing that if not obtained would not
be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no
approval, consent, compliance, exemption, authorization or other action by, or
notice to, or filing with, any applicable Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction or supervision over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, no
consent or approval

 



      
 

 



 

of any third parties, and no lapse of a waiting period under any Requirement
of Law, is necessary or required in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance by, or enforcement against, the Company of this Agreement
(including effectiveness of the Merger).

 



 

Section 4.4 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company, and this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity relating to
enforceability (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at Law or in
equity).

 



 

Section 4.5 _Litigation_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.5_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, there are no legal, administrative or arbitral claims,
suits, litigations, disputes, complaints or proceedings or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, governmental or regulatory investigations which, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened, at Law, in equity, in arbitration or before any
Governmental Authority against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No
material outstanding Order has been issued by any court or other Governmental
Authority against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which any of
their respective assets or properties is subject or bound. _Schedule 4.5_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date hereof, a true,
correct and complete list of each Claim and Order that (i) resulted in any
criminal sanctions to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) within the
last three years resulted in an Order requiring payments in excess of
$1,000,000, in each case by or against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or, in their capacity as such, any of their respective officers or directors,
or (iii) within the last three years imposed any injunctive relief with
respect to, or that has required the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
alter, its business practices.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Compliance with Laws_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been since December 31,
2014 and are in compliance in all material respects with all Requirements of
Law and all Orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or
its Subsidiaries except as would not be reasonably expected to be material
thereto, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold all material authorizations,

Section 4975 of the Code) to which Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the

neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction

would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Company Plan above
the level or expense incurred with respect to that plan for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016.

 



 

(e) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
resulted or would not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no Claim with
respect to any Company Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) by the
Department of Labor, the IRS or any other Governmental Authority or by any
plan participant or beneficiary is pending or to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, relating to the Company Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Company Plans or the assets of any of the

other employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that

Code. No Company Plan is a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of
Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or the equivalent thereof under applicable
non-U.S. Laws). Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not resulted or would not reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no
event has occurred and no condition exists that would, either directly or by
reason of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries affiliation with any of

officer, employee, manager, director, or consultant of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries: (A) any payment, compensation, or benefit (whether of
severance pay or otherwise) becoming due, or increase in the amount of any
payment, compensation, or benefit becoming due, or (B) the acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any payment, compensation, or benefit, or (ii)
the payment or deemed payment of any amount (whether in cash, property, the
vesting of property, or otherwise) that could, individually or in combination
with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment," as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, or (iii) any funding obligation
under any Company Plan or an imposition of any

 



      
 

 



 

restrictions or limitations on the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries right
to administer, amend, or terminate any Company Plan. No person is entitled to

Plans that provide defined benefit pension arrangements to its employees or
former employees.

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE ACQUIRER PARTIES**

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the Acquirer Disclosure Letter (with specific
reference to the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the
information stated in such Acquirer Disclosure Letter relates; _provided_ ,
that (a) the mere inclusion of an item in the Acquirer Disclosure Letter as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
the Acquirer Parties that such item represents a material exception or fact,
event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in an
Acquirer Material Adverse Effect and (b) any item on the Acquirer Disclosure
Letter in any one or more sections of the Acquirer Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed disclosed with respect to other sections of this Agreement and all
other sections or subsections of the Acquirer Disclosure Letter to the extent
the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face
notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference or (ii) as disclosed
in the Acquirer SEC Documents filed or furnished prior to the date hereof (but
excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section,
in any section relating to forward-looking statements and any other
disclosures included in the Acquirer SEC Documents solely to the extent that
they are generic, cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature, whether
or not appearing in such sections, in each case, other than any statements of
fact set forth in such sections), the Acquirer Parties hereby represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

Section 5.1 _Organizational Existence and Power_. Each of the Acquirer Parties
(a) is duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Delaware, (b) has all requisite power (corporate,
company, or limited partnership, as the case may be) and authority to own and
operate its property, assets or rights, to lease the property, assets or
rights it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is

material impact on the Acquirer Parties or their Subsidiaries or their
respective operations, taken as a whole, and (c) is duly qualified to do
business and in good standing (in jurisdictions where applicable) under the
Laws of each jurisdiction in which its ownership, lease or operation of
property, assets or rights or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not, or would
not reasonably be expected to, prevent or materially delay or materially
impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger (an "
_Acquirer Material Adverse Effect_ "). Parent has made available to the
Company complete and correct copies of the certificate of formation (or
comparable organizational documents) of Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as
amended to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Authorization; No Contravention_. Each Acquirer Party has all
requisite organizational power and authority to enter into this Agreement and

Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents to which it will be a
party and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized and approved by such Party, and no corporate, company, limited
partnership or other action on its part is necessary. Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company in Article IV, the
execution, delivery and performance by each Acquirer Party of this Agreement
and each of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, assuming that the consents,
approvals and filings referred to in Section 5.3 are duly obtained and/or
made, do not violate, conflict with or result in any breach, default or
contravention of (or with due notice or lapse of time or both would result in
any breach, default or contravention of), or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of

letters, each dated as of the date hereof (the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ "
and, together with the Investment Agreements, the " _Commitment Letters_ ")
pursuant to which the lenders named therein (the " _Lenders_ "), subject to

or modified in any respect and no such amendment, restatement, waiver or
modification is contemplated or pending, (ii) the respective commitments

to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and subject, as to enforceability,

related arrangements with respect to the Debt Financing, of which Parent has
delivered true, accurate and complete (other than with respect to the
redaction referenced herein) copies to the Company on or prior to the date

contained in the Commitment Letters or that the full amounts committed
pursuant to the Commitment Letters will not be available as of the Closing.
Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or
other fees required by the Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date
of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, assuming that the Financing is funded in accordance
with the Commitment Letters, the aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant
to the definitive agreements contemplated by the Commitment Letters, together
with the cash otherwise available to Parent, in the aggregate, are sufficient
for Parent to pay the Merger Consideration, the Warrant Consideration, all
amounts required to be paid by Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with the Refinancing to be
consummated concurrently or substantially concurrently with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Acquirer Parties and the Company shall have the right to review in advance,
and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The Parties hereto agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party will keep the other Parties
apprised promptly of the status of filings and applications, including
communications with Governmental Authorities that cause such Party to believe
that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Required Government Approval
will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be delayed,
and all other matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each Party shall consult with the other Parties in advance of any
meeting or conference with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Further, and without limiting the generality of the rest of this Section
7.2, each of the Parties shall promptly (i) furnish to the other such
necessary Information and reasonable assistance as the other Party may request
in connection with the foregoing, and (ii) subject to Applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of Information, provide counsel for the other Party with
copies of all filings made by such Party, and all correspondence between such
Party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Authority and any other
Information supplied by such Party and such Partys Subsidiaries to a
Governmental Authority or received from such a Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this Section 7.2, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, and cause its Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to take,
all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits,
authorizations, orders and approvals under applicable Antitrust Law
(collectively, " _Antitrust Clearances_ "), including making an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the Merger as soon as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event
within fifteen (15) days following the date of this Agreement, and using their
reasonable best efforts to supply as soon as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and using their reasonable best efforts to take any others actions as may
be required to obtain such Antitrust Clearances or to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any decrees, judgments,
injunctions or orders under any Antitrust Laws that would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger;
_provided_ , that Parent shall not be required to take, and shall not be
required to cause its Affiliates to take, any action that would result in a
material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation and Acquirer Parties on a
combined basis after the Merger.

 



 

(d) At Parents request and expense, the Company agrees to take all actions
Parent reasonably deems prudent in order to obtain or assist Parent in
obtaining any actions, consents, undertakings, approvals or waivers by or from
any Person for or in connection with, and to reasonably assist Parent in
litigating or otherwise contesting any objections to or proceedings or other
actions challenging, the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

that nothing in this Section 7.2(c) shall obligate the Company to take any
action that is not (i) conditioned on the consummation of the Merger and (ii)
at the expense of Parent.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing shall be governed
exclusively by Section 7.11 and not this Section 7.2.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to Applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of the Acquirer Parties access, for the purpose of
preparing for the integration of the operations of the Company and Parent and
the Merger and other matters contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Financing, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives, in each case in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the
operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, during
such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make
available to the Acquirer Parties (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of the federal securities Laws or federal
or state banking, mortgage lending, real estate or consumer finance or
protection Laws (other than reports or documents which the Company is not
permitted to disclose under Applicable Law or that are publicly filed) and
(ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of preparing for the
integration of the operations of the Company and Parent and the Merger and
other matters contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege, violate any contract or agreement or contravene any Law; and
in any such event, the parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

 



 

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
entered into between the Company and Parent, dated March 17, 2017 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives
shall constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the others set forth herein.

 



 

Section 7.4 _No Solicitation by the Company; the Company Board
Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 7.4, the Company shall
not, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates or any of
its or their respective officers, directors or employees, agents, affiliates
and representatives (including any investment bankers, attorneys or
accountants retained by it or any of its Affiliates)

 



      
 

 



 

(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate (including
by way of providing information) any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry
or proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any Person regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with
respect to, or cooperate in any way with any Person (whether or not a Person
making a Company Takeover Proposal) with respect to any Company Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, (iv) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, asset or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement related to any Company Takeover Proposal
(an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "), (v) enter into any agreement or agreement in
principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder, or
(vi) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Company Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Takeover Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Company Takeover Proposal, which was not preceded by, or resulting
from, any breach of this Section 7.4, that the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) constitutes or is reasonably likely
to result in a Superior Company Proposal, the Company may, subject to
compliance with Section 7.4(f), prior to (but not after) the adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Class A Common Stock in
accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, take any action described in clauses
(x) and (y) below, to the extent that the Company Board concludes in good
faith (and following consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to
take such actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law: (x) furnish information with respect to
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives and any financing sources) pursuant
to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so long as any material non-public
information provided under this clause has previously been provided to the
Acquirer Parties or is provided to the Acquirer Parties substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate
in discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover Proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with the Person making such Company Takeover
Proposal (and such Persons Representatives and any financing sources);
_provided_ , that the Company shall within 24 hours provide Parent with any
information with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries provided
to such Person which was not previously provided to Parent (or its
representatives). The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend, modify or fail to use reasonable
best efforts to enforce any existing standstill, confidentiality or similar
obligations owed by any Person to the Company or

 



      
 

 



 

any of its Subsidiaries under any outstanding agreement relating to a
potential acquisition of the Company or any material portion of its assets, in
each case except to the extent necessary to permit the Company to take an
action it is otherwise permitted to take under this Section 7.4(b) in full
compliance with such provision; _provided_ , that the Company (on behalf of
itself and any of its Subsidiaries) hereby waives any such standstill
obligation to the extent necessary to permit a Person otherwise covered by
such standstill to submit a confidential unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Company Takeover Proposal to the Company Board. For purposes of clarification,
the taking of any of the actions contemplated by clause (x) or (y) of this
Section 7.4(b) shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 7.4(d), neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
Parent), the Company Board Recommendation, (B) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any
Company Takeover Proposal, (C) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any Acquisition
Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), (D) enter into
any agreement, letter of intent, or agreement in principle requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder, (E) subject to
Section 7.4(g), fail to recommend against any Company Takeover Proposal
subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement of such Company Takeover Proposal, or (F)
fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or re-
affirm such Company Board Recommendation at the request of Parent within ten
(10) Business Days or (ii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (each
being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company Board may, prior to
(but not after) the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of shares of
Company Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (x) in response to an unsolicited
_bona fide_ written Company Takeover Proposal, the Company Board determines
(after consultation with its outside legal and, with regard to financial
matters, its financial advisors) that such unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal and
following consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to violate its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, or
(y) other than in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, an event, fact,
circumstance, development or occurrence that affects the business, assets or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries that is unknown to the Company
Board as of the date of this Agreement becomes known to the Company Board (an
" _Intervening Event_ ") prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of shares of Company Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section
251 of the DGCL and the Company Board has concluded in good faith, following
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall

 



      
 

 



 

not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change until after the fifth (5th) Business Day (the " _Recommendation Change
Notice Period_ ") following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Company
Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to take such action, including the details of the
Intervening Event or, in the case of a Superior Company Proposal, the terms
and conditions of any Superior Company Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Company Board and the identity of the party making such
Superior Company Proposal, and, if applicable, shall have contemporaneously
provided a copy of all of the relevant proposed transaction agreements and any
other documents provided by, or correspondence with, the party making such
Superior Company Proposal, including the then-current form of the definitive
agreements with respect to such Superior Company Proposal (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Superior Company
Proposal or change to the material facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event shall require a new Company Notice of Recommendation Change
and trigger a new Recommendation Change Notice Period). The Company Board may
not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of a Superior
Company Proposal if any such Superior Company Proposal resulted from a breach
by the Company of this Section 7.4.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining whether to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent in
response to a Company Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise; _provided_
, that the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its financial and legal advisors to, during the Recommendation Change Notice
Period and prior to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent also seeks to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that (i) in
the event of a Company Notice of Recommendation Change in respect of a
Superior Company Proposal, this Agreement results in a transaction that is no
less favorable to the stockholders of the Company than any Company Takeover
Proposal that would be deemed to constitute a Superior Company Proposal in the
absence of such adjustments or (ii) in the event of a Company Notice of
Recommendation change in respect of an Intervening Event, the Company Board
would no longer be required to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
order not to be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, and, in the event Parent
agrees to make such adjustments to the Agreement in either case of clause (i)
or (ii) above, as applicable, no Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall
be made.

 



 

(f) In addition to the foregoing obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 7.4, the Company shall within 24 hours of the receipt thereof, advise
Parent orally of any Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall (x) keep Parent informed in all material respects
and on a reasonably current basis (and in no event later than 24 hours from
the occurrence or existence of any material event, fact or circumstance) of
the status and details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of
any Company Takeover Proposal, and (y) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all

 



      
 

 



 

correspondence and other written material exchanged between the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of the terms or
conditions of any Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop,
look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or
making any other legally required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Company, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or such disclosure is
otherwise required under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that any such statement
that would be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be in accordance
with Section 7.4(d) and Section 7.4(e).

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing) to the Company, with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect
acquisition of more than 20% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or voting power of the Company, (iii) sale, lease, contribution or other
disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint
venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise) of any business or assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (iv) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to
any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or group of securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting
power of the Company, (v) any tender offer or exchange offer as a result of
which any Person or group shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial
ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of 20% or more of the
voting power of the Company or (vi) any combination of the foregoing (in each
case, other than the Merger).

 



 

" _Superior Company Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ written Company Takeover
Proposal made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third party
(or, in a parent-to-parent merger involving such third party, the stockholders
of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of the voting power of the Company or substantially all of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on terms which the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its legal advisors
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) (i) to be
superior to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view
than (x) the Merger (including the Merger Consideration), taking into account
all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the Person making the
proposal (including all financial, regulatory, legal conditions to
consummation and other aspects of such

 



      
 

 



 

proposal), and (y) this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to
the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) is reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms proposed and (iii) for which all requisite cash funds
are or will be immediately available or will be committed by identified
financing sources at the time of signing a definitive transaction agreement.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or
other public statements with respect to the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by
Applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system. Parent and the Company agree that the initial press release
to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt notice
to the Company and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent (in such
capacity, the " _Notifying Party_ ") of the occurrence, or failure to occur,
of any event which occurrence or failure to occur (a) would cause or be
reasonably likely to cause an Acquirer Party Material Adverse Effect or a
Company Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or (b) which the Notifying
Party believes would cause or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of the Notifying Partys representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein that reasonably could be expected to
give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition set
forth in, if an Acquirer Party is the Notifying Party, Section 8.1 or Section
8.3, or if the Company is the Notifying Party, Section 8.1 or Section 8.2;
_provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this Section 7.6 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.2 or
Section 8.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case, unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 to be satisfied.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent agrees that all rights,
existing as of the date hereof, to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) or in any indemnification, employment or other
similar agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth in
_Schedule 7.7_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the
date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is as of the date
of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time, serving at the request of the Company of any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person (all of the foregoing,
collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (" _Losses_
"), incurred or arising in connection with any claim, action, investigation,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring or
alleged to have existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company
Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person or any act or
omission by such Company Indemnified Party while serving in such capacity,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law. In the event of any such claim,
action, investigation, suit or proceeding, (x) each Company Indemnified Party
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding from the Surviving
Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Surviving
Corporation from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ , that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter. Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 7.7, upon learning of any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall
promptly notify the Company and, if so learning after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation thereof in writing; _provided_ , that the failure
promptly to so notify in writing shall not affect the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation except to the extent, if any, that it is materially
prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 



 

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.7.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (i) cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) provide substitute
polices for the Company and its current and former directors and officers (and
any individual who becomes an officer or director prior to the Effective Time)
who are currently (or prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company in either case, of not less than the amount of
existing coverage and have other terms and from carriers not less favorable to
the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Effective Time, except that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than
300% of the annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the
year ended December 31, 2016 (such 300% amount, the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and
if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by
this Section 7.7 it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for
the years within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of
such insurance, prior to the Closing Date, Parent may direct that the Company,
in which case the Company shall, purchase a "tail" directors and officers
liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the
Company and its current and former directors and officers (and any individual
who becomes an officer or director prior to the Effective Time) who are
currently (or prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the directors
and officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained
by the Company. In the event the Company purchases such tail coverage, the
Surviving Corporation shall cease to have any obligations under the first
sentence of this Section 7.7(c).

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.7, (i) shall survive consummation of the
Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified
Parties), his or her heirs and (iii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Takeover Laws_. The Parties hereto and their respective boards
of directors or other governing bodies shall (i) use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable
to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents and, (ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause any disposition or acquisition by the Companys directors
and officers of shares of Company Capital Stock or conversion of any
derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
including any such actions specified in the applicable SEC No-Action Letter
dated January 12, 1999.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Litigation_. The Company and Parent shall each give the other
Party the opportunity to participate at its own expense, to the extent
practicable and subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information and in a manner that does not result in any waiver or loss of
attorney-client privilege, in the defense or settlement of any litigation
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or any
litigation by or against any holder of Company

 



      
 

 



 

Notes or lender under the Company Credit Agreement, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate, on a timely basis, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters on the terms set forth therein (subject
to any "flex" provisions applicable to the Debt Financing; provided that such
"flex" provisions would not adversely affect the amount or availability of the
Debt Financing). Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Commitment Letters and comply with its obligations and
conditions thereunder, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements on
a timely basis with respect to the Financing on terms and conditions (subject
to any "flex" provisions applicable to the Debt Financing; provided that such
"flex" provisions would not adversely affect the amount or availability of the
Debt Financing) contained in the Commitment Letters or otherwise no less
favorable to Parent with respect to timing, amount or conditions than those
contained in the Commitment Letters (the " _Financing Agreements_ "), and
(iii) satisfy (or have waived) on a timely basis all conditions and covenants
applicable to Parent in the Commitment Letters that are within its control at
or prior to the Closing (including the payment of any commitment, engagement
or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt Financing), and
otherwise comply in all material respects with its obligations under the
Commitment Letters (including the Financing Agreements). Parent shall keep the
Company reasonably informed of material developments in respect of Parents
efforts to arrange the Financing, including any changes to the respective
amounts of the Debt Financing and Equity Financing. Prior to the Closing,
without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not agree to,
or permit, any amendment, modification or supplement of, or waiver under, the
Commitment Letters to the extent such amendment, modification, supplement or
waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount to be funded under the Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing or similar fees) unless (x) in the case of a
reduction in the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount or (y) in the case of a reduction in the Equity
Financing, the Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding amount, (ii)
amend, modify or supplement the conditions or contingencies to the Financing
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to make it less likely the
Financing will be funded or imposes new or additional conditions or expands
any existing condition to the receipt of the Financing at the Closing or (iii)
be reasonably expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver to
the Company true and completed copies of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver (which, in the case of fee letters, may be redacted to
omit numerical amounts and certain economic "flex" terms, none of which would
adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Parent may amend the Commitment Letters to
add investors, lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letters as of the date
hereof and, in connection therewith, amend the economic and other arrangements
with respect to the existing and additional investors, lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, if the
addition of such additional

 



      
 

 



 

parties and amendment of additional terms do not adversely impact the
aggregate amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing and (y) in the
event that Parent is required pursuant to this Section 7.11 to provide any
information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege, Parent
may withhold disclosure of such information so long as Parent gives notice to
the Company of the fact that it is withholding such information and thereafter
the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection.

 



 

(b) In the event any portion of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions applicable to the Debt Financing) contemplated in the Investment
Agreements or the Debt Commitment Letters, as applicable, and such portion is
necessary to fund the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
shall promptly notify the Company and shall, (i) with respect to the Equity
Financing, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange to obtain as promptly as practicable alternative equity
financing from alternative sources for such portion (x) on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable to the Company than the Investment
Agreements and (y) in an amount equal to the amount of the Equity Financing
and (ii) with respect to the Debt Financing, use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain as promptly as
practicable alternative debt financing from alternative sources for such
portion (x) on terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent
than the Debt Commitment Letters and (y) in an amount equal to the amount of
the Debt Financing, such that the amount of alternative financing obtained
under (i) and (ii) equals an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger. To
the extent that Parent is unable to obtain any amount of alternative equity
financing to replace the Equity Financing, Parent shall draw upon any
additional amounts available under the Debt Financing to cover the shortfall.
If obtained, Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and complete
copies of a new equity commitment or a new debt financing commitment, as
applicable, pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide Parent with any portion of the Equity Financing or the Debt
Financing, as applicable. References in this Agreement to (i) the "Equity
Financing" shall include the equity financing contemplated by the Investment
Agreements as amended, modified or replaced and references in this Agreement
to the "Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters as amended, modified or replaced, (ii) the Investment
Agreements and the "Debt Commitment Letters" shall include such documents as
amended, modified or replaced and (iii) "Equity Financing Sources" and "Debt
Financing Sources" shall include the providers of equity or debt financing, as
applicable, under such documents as amended, modified or replaced (in the case
of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), including replacement with alternative
financing and alternative equity or debt financing commitments (as applicable)
pursuant to this Section 7.11 from and after such amendment, modification or
replacement); _provided_ , that fee letters or side letters which do not
contain "flex" or other provisions which affect the terms or conditions of the
Debt Financing shall not be required to be provided.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing or any
alternate Financing pursuant to Section 7.11(b) is not a condition to the
Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Financing or any alternative Financing.

Section 10.4 _Successors and Assigns; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement
nor any rights, interests and obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any
Party, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without

holders of Company Common Stock, Company Warrants and Company Equity Awards as

and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights

Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 (subject to Section 10.6(b) with
respect to Claims by the Company and its Affiliates directly against any
Financing Source), the parties shall be entitled to an injunction

 



      
 

 



 

or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court referred to in Section 10.7 below, without proof of actual damages (and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent
permitted by Law, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates (other
than the Acquirer Parties) shall commence or prosecute any Claim, at law or in
equity, against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the

parties to the Financing under any commitment letter related thereto;
_provided_ , _further_ that, the Acquirer Parties and their respective
Affiliates shall have the right to enforce all of its respective rights under
the Commitment Letters against the Financing Sources and (ii) no Financing

enforce the obligations of the Acquirer Parties in this Agreement, including
Section 7.11.

relating to this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance

beneficiaries of and may enforce any liability cap or limitation on damages or
remedies in this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 10.6(b))

express third-party beneficiaries of Section 10.6(b) and this Section 10.7(d).

of this Agreement is held to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
