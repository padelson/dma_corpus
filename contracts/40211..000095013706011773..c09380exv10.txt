          including, but not limited to any "employee benefit plan" (as such

          control agreement, unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement;
          and

2.7  Assets That Are Not Transferable

     2.7.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the
          extent that (a) any required consent or approval shall not have been
          given prior to the Closing Date (or the relevant Deferred Date, as the
          case may be) with respect to the transfer or assignment of any
          Designated Contract or Material Contract which is not assignable or
          transferable without the consent or approval of any Person or (b) the
          transfer or assignment of any Designated Contract or Material Contract
          is not permitted by Applicable Law, then such Designated Contract or
          Material Contract shall not be assigned or transferred to Buyer at the
          Closing Date (or the relevant Deferred Date, as the case may be);
          provided, that Seller and Buyer shall have the continuing obligation
          after the Closing Date (or the relevant Deferred Date, as the case may
          be) to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
          consents to the assignment or transfer thereof, it being understood
          that Seller shall have no obligation to commence any litigation or
          offer or grant any material financial or any other material
          accommodation to any third party to obtain such consents. Upon
          obtaining the requisite third-party consents or approvals thereto,
          such Designated Contract or Material Contract shall promptly be
          transferred and assigned to Buyer or its permitted designees hereunder
          if it is legally permissible to do so.

     2.7.2 With respect to any Designated Contract or Material Contract that is
          not transferred or assigned to Buyer on the Closing Date (or the
          relevant Deferred Date, as the case may be) by reason of Clause 2.7.1,
          after the Closing Date (or the relevant Deferred Date, as the case may
          be) and until any requisite consent or approval is obtained therefore
          and the same is transferred and assigned to Buyer, Buyer and Seller
          shall cooperate with each other, upon the reasonable written request
          of Buyer, in endeavouring to obtain for Buyer, at no cost to Seller,
          an arrangement with respect thereto to provide for Buyer substantially
          comparable benefits therein, and to the extent Buyer receives benefits
          therefrom, Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller with respect to all
          Liabilities of Seller in respect of any such arrangement.

     2.8.1 The cash purchase price for the Business (the "PURCHASE PRICE") is
          one billion three hundred and four million, five hundred thousand
          Dollars ($1,304,500,000) (it being confirmed, for the purposes of
          information only, that such amount was agreed by Seller and Buyer on

               its Specified Ownership Interest proportion of any Event of Loss
               Proceeds with respect to any Aircraft after the date of this
               Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or the Deferred Date, as
               the case may be, on which the relevant Specified Ownership
               Interest is transferred, the sum in Dollars equal to such GATX
               Retained Entity's Specified Ownership Interest proportion of such
               Event of Loss Proceeds;

          (b)  In the event of any GATX Retained Entity receiving and retaining
               its Specified Ownership Interest proportion of the proceeds of
               sale of any Aircraft sold pursuant to the Contemplated
               Arrangements after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
               Closing Date or the Deferred Date, as the case may be, on which
               the relevant Specified Ownership Interest is transferred
               hereunder, the sum in Dollars equal to such GATX Retained
               Entity's Specified Ownership Interest proportion of such proceeds
               of sale; and

          (c)  Aircraft Sum.

     2.8.3 The Purchase Price shall be increased by the following amounts (if
          applicable):

               prepaid following the date hereof and prior to the Closing or the
               Deferred Closing (in relation to the relevant Specified Ownership
               Interest in any Partnership Asset Owning Entity which is
               transferred on a Deferred Date), as the case may be, the amount
               in Dollars certified by Seller as being the sum (i) in the case
               of External Debt Financing Indebtedness of a Wholly Owned Asset
               Owning Entity, the amount in Dollars certified by Seller as being


                                      -25-

<PAGE>

               the sum of any termination costs or prepayment premiums or
               penalties borne or paid in connection with such prepayments, and
               (ii) in the case of External Debt Financing Indebtedness of a
               Partnership Asset Owning Entity, the relevant Selling Party's
               Specified Ownership Interest of (1) the principal amount of such
               Indebtedness so prepaid, and (2) the amount in Dollars certified
               by Seller as being the sum of any termination costs or prepayment
               premiums or penalties borne or paid in connection with such
               prepayments;

          (b)  The sum of all payments made by Seller to Airbus under the Airbus
               Purchase Agreement after the date hereof and prior to the
               Closing; and

          (c)  The sum of all amounts invested by any member of the GATX Group
               prior to the Closing in West Portal Leasing Ltd. in connection
               with the arrangements contemplated or to be contemplated by the
               Tiger 2006 Documents.

     2.8.4 Working Capital Adjustment

          (a)  The parties agree that the Working Capital of the Business as of
               the Closing Date (the "CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL"), as calculated
               in accordance with and set forth on the statement of Working
               Capital set forth in Schedule 11 (the "FORM WORKING CAPITAL
               STATEMENT") is targeted to be two million one hundred and ninety
               thousand Dollars ($2,190,000) (the "WORKING CAPITAL TARGET").
               "Working Capital" means the difference between (i) the sum of the
               amounts shown in the line items listed on the Form Working
               Capital Statement under "Selected Assets" of the Business and
               (ii) the sum of the amounts shown in the line items listed on
               Form Working Capital Statement under "Selected Liabilities" with
               respect to the Business.

          (b)  For purposes of this Agreement, Working Capital shall be
               calculated in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting
               methods, components, policies, practices and procedures, with
               consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology,
               as were used in preparation of the Working Capital Target of the
               Business (the "WORKING CAPITAL PRACTICES"), certain of which
               Working Capital Practices are set forth on Attachment A to the
               Form Working Capital Statement.

          (c)  Seller shall cause to be prepared and, within five (5) Business
               Days prior to the Closing Date, but in no event less than two (2)
               Business Days prior to the Closing Date, shall cause to be
               delivered to Buyer, a good faith estimate of the Closing Working
               Capital as of the Closing Date (the "ESTIMATED WORKING CAPITAL").
               The Estimated Working Capital shall be determined in accordance
               with GAAP using the same Working Capital Practices as were used
               in preparation of the Form Working Capital Statement and shall be
               in the same form as the Form Working Capital Statement. The
               amount of the Purchase Price payable on the Closing shall be (i)
               increased on a Dollar for Dollar basis by the amount, if any, by


                                      -26-

<PAGE>

               which the Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Working
               Capital Target or (ii) reduced on a Dollar for Dollar basis by
               the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital is
               less than the Working Capital Target, as the case may be.

          (d)  Buyer shall cause to be prepared and, as soon as practical, but
               in no event later than forty five (45) Business Days following
               the Closing Date, shall cause to be delivered to Seller a
               calculation of the Closing Working Capital (the "INITIAL
               CALCULATION"). The Initial Calculation shall be determined in
               accordance with GAAP using the same Working Capital Practices as
               were used in preparation of the Form Working Capital Statement
               and shall be in the same form as the Form Working Capital
               Statement.

          (e)  Within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of the Initial
               Calculation by Buyer, Seller may deliver to Buyer a written
               notice (the "CALCULATION NOTICE") either (i) advising Buyer that
               Seller agrees with and accepts the Initial Calculation or (ii)
               setting forth a reasonably detailed explanation of those items in
               the Initial Calculation that Seller disputes and a statement,
               with reasonable detail as to the disputed matters, of what Seller
               believes is the correct calculation of Closing Working Capital.
               Buyer shall provide Seller and its representatives (including its
               accountants) with reasonable access, during normal business
               hours, to its books and records for purposes of Seller's review
               of the Initial Calculation. If Seller does not submit a
               Calculation Notice within the twenty (20) Business Day period
               provided herein or agrees with the calculation as set forth in
               sub-clause (i) above, then the Initial Calculation shall become
               final and binding and shall not be subject to further review,
               challenge or adjustment.

          (f)  In the event that Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any
               disputes regarding the Closing Working Capital in good faith
               within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of Seller's
               delivery of a Calculation Notice with objections under sub-clause
               (e)(ii) above, then such disputes shall be referred to an
               internationally recognized firm of independent certified public
               accountants selected by mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer (the
               "SETTLEMENT ACCOUNTANTS"), and the determination of the
               Settlement Accountants shall be final and shall not be subject to
               further review, challenge or adjustment. Failing agreement
               between Seller and Buyer as to the appointment of the settlement
               accountants, the Settlement Accountants shall be Deloitte &
               Touche. Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
               efforts to cause the Settlement Accountants to reach a
               determination not more than thirty (30) Business Days after such
               referral. Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize or
               permit the Settlement Accountants to resolve any dispute by
               making an adjustment to an Initial Calculation that is outside of
               the range defined by such Initial Calculation and the applicable
               Calculation Notice. Each party shall pay its own costs and
               expenses incurred in connection with this sub-clause (f);
               provided, however, that the Settlement Accountant shall allocate
               the fees


                                      -27-

<PAGE>

               between Buyer and Seller based upon the relative correctness of
               the initial positions taken by such parties in the Initial
               Calculation and Calculation Notice. Such allocation of fees shall
               be final and shall not be subject to further review, challenge or
               adjustment.

          (g)  "WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT", which may be positive or
               negative, shall mean (i) the Closing Working Capital, as finally
               determined in accordance with this Clause 2.8.4, minus (ii) the
               Estimated Working Capital.

          (h)  If a Working Capital Adjustment Amount is positive, then Buyer
               shall promptly deliver, by wire transfer of immediately available
               funds to an account designated in writing by Seller, an amount
               equal to such Working Capital Adjustment Amount, together with
               interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at
               the rate of interest published as the "Prime Rate" in the "Money
               Rates" column of the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal
               (or the average of such rates if more than one rate is indicated)
               on the Closing Date (the "CLOSING DATE INTEREST RATE"). If a
               Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then
               Seller shall promptly deliver, by wire transfer of immediately
               available funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer, an
               amount equal to such Working Capital Adjustment Amount, together
               with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of
               payment at the Closing Date Interest Rate.

          (i)  For purposes of this Clause 2.8.4 all computations of interest
               shall be made on the basis of a year of three hundred and sixty
               five (365) days, in each case for the actual number of days
               (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in
               the period for which such interest is payable. Any payments made
               by any Person pursuant to this Clause 2.8.4 shall be made by wire
               transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business
               Days after the date on which the applicable Closing Working
               Capital is final and binding on the parties.

2.9  Purchase Price Allocation

     For Tax reporting purposes, the Purchase Price (as adjusted for any
     liabilities assumed by Buyer) shall be allocated by Seller and Buyer among
     the assets owned by the Asset Owning Entities and the Owner Trusts
     interests in which are transferred to Buyer hereunder and the Additional
     Assets that are transferred to Buyer hereunder, solely in a manner
     consistent Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Such
     allocation shall be made in accordance with the following procedure:

     2.9.1 Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date and each Deferred Date,
          Buyer will provide to Seller a schedule (each such schedule, an "ASSET
          ACQUISITION STATEMENT") with Buyer's proposed allocation of the
          Closing Date Allocated Amount or the Deferred Date Allocated Amount,
          as applicable, as adjusted for any liabilities assumed by Buyer at the
          Closing or Deferred Closing, as applicable, among the assets of the
          Asset Owning Entities and Owner Trusts interests in which are
          transferred, and the Additional Assets transferred, at the


                                      -28-

<PAGE>

          Closing or Deferred Closing, as applicable. Within thirty (30) days
          after the receipt of any Asset Acquisition Statement, Seller will
          propose to Buyer in writing any changes to such Asset Acquisition
          Statement (and in the event no such changes are proposed in writing to
          Buyer within such time period, Seller will be deemed to have agreed
          to, and accepted, such Asset Acquisition Statement). Buyer and Seller
          will endeavor in good faith to resolve any differences with respect to
          such Asset Acquisition Statement within fifteen (15) days after
          Buyer's receipt of written notice of changes from Seller.

     2.9.2 If Seller withholds its consent to the allocation reflected in an
          Asset Acquisition Statement, and Buyer and Seller have acted in good
          faith to resolve any differences with respect to items on the Asset
          Acquisition Statement and thereafter are unable resolve any
          differences that, in the aggregate, are material in relation to the
          Closing Date Allocated Amount or Deferred Date Allocated Amount, as
          applicable, then any remaining disputed matters will be finally and
          conclusively determined by an independent accounting firm of
          recognized international standing (the "ALLOCATION ARBITER")
          reasonably acceptable to both Buyer and Seller. Promptly, but not
          later than thirty (30) days after its acceptance of appointment
          hereunder, the Allocation Arbiter will determine (based solely on
          presentations by Seller and Buyer and not by independent review) only
          those matters in dispute and will render a written report as to the
          disputed matters and the resulting allocation of the Closing Date
          Allocated Amount or Deferred Date Allocated Amount, as applicable,
          which report shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. Any
          expenses of the Allocation Arbiter will be borne equally by Buyer and
          Seller.

     2.9.3 Seller and Buyer agree (a) to report the allocation of the Closing
          Date Allocated Amount and each Deferred Date Allocated Amount in a
          manner entirely consistent with the Asset Acquisition Statement
          relating to such Closing Date Allocated Amount or Deferred Date
          Allocated Amount, as the case may be, or, if applicable, the
          determination of the Allocation Arbiter relating to such Closing Date
          Allocated Amount or Deferred Date Allocated Amount, as the case may
          be, and (b) to act in accordance with such allocation in the filing of
          all Tax Returns (including filing Form 8594 with their federal income
          Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the date of the Closing
          or Deferred Closing, as applicable) and in the course of any Tax
          audit, Tax review or Tax litigation relating thereto, except as
          otherwise required under Applicable Law or as required by a final
          determination of a Tax liability that, under Applicable Law, is not
          subject to further appeal, review or modification through proceedings
          or otherwise. The parties will cooperate in connection with the
          preparation and filing of IRS Form 8594.

     2.9.4 In the event the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to this
          Agreement, the allocation determined under Clauses 2.9.1 through 2.9.3
          shall be revised in accordance with the nature of the applicable
          adjustment.

2.10 Closing

<PAGE>

     2.10.1 Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Clause
          12 and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (a) the
          closing (the "CLOSING") of the purchase and sale of (i) the Specified
          Ownership Interests (other than the Specified Ownership Interests in
          relation to any Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entities (the
          "REMAINING OWNERSHIP INTERESTS")) and (ii) the Additional Assets
          (other than any Material Contract relating to any Deferred Partnership
          Asset Owning Entity) (the assets specified in (i) and (ii) being the
          "CLOSING ASSETS") shall take place on the Closing Date, and (b) the
          closing (the "DEFERRED CLOSING") of the purchase and sale of each of
          Remaining Ownership Interests (together with any related Material
          Contracts) shall take place on the relevant Deferred Date, if ever.

     2.10.2 On the Closing Date or each Deferred Date, as the case may be, Buyer
          shall pay to Seller the Closing Date Allocated Amount or the relevant
          Deferred Date Allocated Amount, as applicable, in immediately
          available funds by credit to the account designated by Seller by
          notice to Buyer delivered not later than two (2) Business Days prior
          to the Closing Date or the relevant Deferred Date, as the case may be.

     2.10.3 On the Closing Date and each Deferred Date Seller shall (or, as
          applicable, Seller shall cause the applicable Other Selling Party to)

     Buyer is an entity duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under
     the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, with full corporate
     power and authority to conduct its business as it is now being conducted.
     Buyer is duly qualified to do business and, in the case of those
     jurisdictions where such concept is known, is in good standing in each
     jurisdiction where that qualification is necessary, except for those

     to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.2  Corporate Authorization

     The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement, the
     closing deliverables and the other instruments required to consummate the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which Buyer is a party (the

     contemplated by this Agreement and Buyer Closing Documents are within
     Buyer's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
     corporate and stockholder action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement
     constitutes, and Buyer Closing Documents will constitute, the legal, valid
     and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance
     with their


                                      -38-

     respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a)
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of
     general applicability affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and
     (b) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
     such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

4.3  Governmental Authorization

     The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement, Buyer
     Closing Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement and Buyer Closing Documents require no action by or in
     respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (a)
     compliance with any applicable requirements of any applicable Competition
     Laws, (b) any such action or filing in any jurisdiction in which any
     Aircraft is registered, habitually based or operated related to, or in
     connection with, that registration, habitual basing or operation, and (c)
     any such action or filing as to which the failure to make or obtain would
     not have a material adverse effect on Buyer or on Buyer's ability to
     consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.4  Non-contravention

     The (a) execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and
     Buyer Closing Documents and (b) the consummation of the transactions

     4.4.2 violate any Applicable Law;

     4.4.3 require any consent of, or other action by, any Person under,

          such Person is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other
          instrument binding upon such Person or the assets of such Person; or

     except, in the case of each of the foregoing Clauses 4.4.2 and 4.4.3, for
     such violations, consents, actions, defaults or termination rights as would
     not have a material adverse effect on Buyer or on Buyer's ability to

          Debt Commitment Letter, the "COMMITMENT LETTERS"), which are in full
          force and effect as of the date of this Agreement and pursuant to
          which the Equity Investors have committed to provide equity financing,
          on the terms and conditions set forth therein, to Buyer in connection

     4.5.2 The proceeds of the Debt Financing, together with the funds to be

          transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the Commitment
          Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, (a) the Commitment Letters
          have not been withdrawn, (b) Buyer does not know of any facts or
          circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in the
          withdrawal of the Commitment Letters, and (c) neither Buyer nor any of

          commitment letter or other arrangement with the Lender or any other
          financing source that relates to, or bears in any material respect on
          any Commitment Letter or the rights and obligations set forth in any
          such Commitment Letter.

4.6  Purchase for Investment

     4.6.1 Buyer is acquiring the Specified Ownership Interests for its own
          account solely for investment and not with a view to, or for offer or
          resale in connection with, a distribution of any of the Specified
          Ownership Interests or any "beneficial interest" (within the meaning
          of the 1933 Act) in the Specified Ownership Interests, and Buyer has
          no present intent, agreement or understanding to sell or otherwise
          dispose (other than by way of pledge in connection with the Debt
          Financing) of any Specified Ownership Interests to any other Person;
          provided, however, that the disposition of Buyer's property remains at
          all times within Buyer's sole discretion.

     4.6.2 Buyer is an "accredited investor" (within the meaning of Regulation D
          under the 1933 Act) and either alone or together with its advisors has
          sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
          so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
          investment in the Specified Ownership Interests and is capable of
          bearing the economic risks of such investment.

     4.6.3 Buyer understands that the Specified Ownership Interests have not
          been registered under the 1933 Act or the securities or blue sky laws
          of any State of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Buyer
          also understands that the Specified Ownership Interests are being sold
          pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in the 1933 Act
          and any such State or other jurisdictions' securities or blue-sky laws
          based in part upon Buyer's representations contained in this
          Agreement.

     contemplated by this Agreement.

          Buyer has made such investigations and examinations, engaged such

          of or imputed to any Identified Party, and Buyer further acknowledges
          that, in entering into this Agreement, it has relied solely on its own
          investigation of the Business and the representations and warranties
          expressly set forth in this Agreement, subject to the limitations and
          restrictions specified herein.

     4.9.4 SELLER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, PROMISES,
          COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS OR GUARANTIES OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER
          WHATSOEVER REGARDING THE MERCHANTABILITY, MARKETABILITY,

          subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to Seller

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

          investigation of the Business and Buyer's financing of the
          transactions contemplated by this Agreement, it being understood and
          agreed that for the purposes of this Clause 5.2.1, it will be a
          reasonable request of Buyer to have up to three (3) representatives of
          Buyer on site at the San Francisco office of Seller for observation
          purposes. All information obtained by Buyer, its counsel, financial
          advisors, financiers, auditors and other authorized representatives

          Contemplated Arrangements. No investigation by Buyer or other
          information or notice received by Buyer shall operate as a waiver or
          otherwise affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or
          made by Seller under this Agreement.

     5.2.2 On and after the Closing Date or, as applicable, the applicable
          Deferred Date, Seller will, if it has the ability to do so by contract
          or otherwise, afford promptly to Buyer and its agents reasonable
          access to its books of account, financial and other records,
          information, agreements (including any agreements related to the
          Business which are not assigned to Buyer herein), employees and
          auditors to the extent necessary or useful for Buyer in connection
          with any audit, investigation, dispute or litigation or any other
          reasonable business purpose relating to the Business; provided that
          any such access by Buyer shall not (a) unreasonably interfere with the
          conduct of the business of Seller or its Affiliates or (b) extend to
          information which in Seller's good faith opinion is sensitive or the
          disclosure of which could subject Seller or any of its Affiliates to
          risk of liability or the loss of attorney-client, work product or any
          other legal privilege. Buyer shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs
          and expenses (including attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement
          for general overhead, salaries and employee benefits) reasonably
          incurred in connection with the foregoing. The foregoing shall not
          limit the definition of "Files and Records."

          one hand, and any Asset Owning Entity or Owner Trust (or any of their
          respective Subsidiaries), on the other hand, as of Closing Date or the
          Deferred Date, if any, applicable to the relevant Specified Ownership
          Interest, shall be settled (irrespective of the terms of payment of

          shall be paid in full in cash on or prior to the Closing Date, or the
          relevant Deferred Date, as the case may be, (and, to the extent not so
          paid, they shall be cancelled effective at the Closing Date, or the
          relevant Deferred Date, as the case may be).

     5.3.2 Save as may be expressly provided herein or may be otherwise agreed
          to the contrary between Seller and Buyer, any and all agreements
          between any GATX Retained Entity, on one hand, and any Asset Owning
          Entity, on the other hand (including all options to acquire or sell
          property granted by or to Asset Owning Entities, Owner Trusts or any
          of their respective Subsidiaries to or by GATX Retained Entities),
          shall, without any further action on the part of any party, be deemed
          terminated as of the Closing Date or the Deferred Date, if any,
          applicable to the relevant Specified Ownership Interest is transferred
          to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, as the case may be, and, upon
          such termination the applicable Asset Owning Entities and GATX
          Retained Entities shall, without any action on the part of any party,
          shall be deemed released by the other party from any and all
          Liabilities thereunder or in connection therewith (whether contractual
          or otherwise), except as otherwise provided by this Agreement.

5.4  Resignations

     Seller will deliver to Buyer at the Closing or the Deferred Date, if any,
     applicable to the relevant Specified Ownership Interest transferred to
     Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, as the case may be, the resignations of
     such directors of each relevant Asset Owning Entity who are nominees of
     Seller or any other member of the GATX Group as may be requested in writing
     by Buyer not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date or
     the Deferred Date, if any, applicable to the relevant Specified Ownership

               the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a reasonable
               opportunity to subcontract the management of any aircraft that
               are included in any portfolio of assets for which Seller enters
               into a contract to manage after the Closing Date);

          (c)  operating or investing in any aircraft engine leasing business,
               including pursuant to its existing partnership with Rolls-Royce

               business which is engaged in the aircraft leasing business,
               except that where more than one-third of the revenues of the
               Person or of the business acquired as set out in the latest
               available audited financial statements of that Person or business
               is generated from the aircraft leasing business, Seller or the
               applicable Affiliate of Seller shall use its reasonable best
               efforts to dispose of such aircraft leasing businesses so
               acquired (it being understood that (i) prior to disposing of such
               aircraft leasing business so acquired, Seller shall provide Buyer
               with a reasonable opportunity to review such aircraft leasing
               business and make Seller an offer with respect thereto and (ii)
               where some, but less than one-third, of the revenues of the
               Person or of the business acquired as set out in the latest
               available audited financial statements of that Person or
               business, is generated from the aircraft leasing business, Seller

               business);

          (e)  acquiring or holding any interest in any joint venture (whether
               incorporated or unincorporated); provided that the primary
               purpose of the business of that joint venture is not the conduct
               of aircraft leasing business; or

          (f)  owning (i) less than an aggregate of ten per cent. (10%) of any
               class of stock of a Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in
               the aircraft leasing business; or (ii) less than ten per cent.
               (10%) in value of the indebtedness of a Person engaged, directly
               or indirectly, in the aircraft leasing business.

     5.5.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Clause
          5.5.1 shall not apply to any third party which (a) acquires a majority
          equity interest in GATX Corporation or in any of the Affiliates of
          GATX Corporation or (b) acquires all or a portion of the business or
          assets of GATX Corporation or any


                                      -47-

<PAGE>

          of the Affiliates of GATX Corporation, regardless of the form of such
          transaction, and Clause 5.5.1 shall not apply to any of the Affiliates
          of such third party (other than the entity GATX Corporation and the
          entities which were Affiliates of GATX Corporation prior to such
          acquisition).

5.6  Letters of Credit

     Seller will make arrangements to deliver to Buyer original copies of all
     letters of credit being held by, or on behalf of, any Asset Owning Entity,
     as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date or the Deferred Date, if
     any, applicable to the relevant Specified Ownership Interest transferred to
     Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent that any action by Seller
     or any GATX Retained Entity is necessary in order to either (a) make a
     drawing under any such letter of credit or (b) transfer the right to draw
     under any such letter of credit to Buyer or a Buyer designee, Seller shall,
     or shall cause the relevant GATX Retained Entity to, take such actions as
     Buyer may reasonably request to effect such drawing or transfer. Buyer
     shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller or the relevant GATX Retained
     Entity with respect to any such action taken by Seller or such GATX
     Retained Entity. The terms of Clause 11.3 shall apply to Buyer's indemnity
     obligations under this Clause 5.6.

6.   COVENANTS OF BUYER

     Buyer agrees that:

6.1  Access; Seller Confidentiality

     Buyer will, and will cause each Asset Owning Entity and each Owner Trust
     to, afford to Seller and its agents, promptly on and after the Closing Date
     or, in relation to any Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entity, the
     Deferred Date applicable to such Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entity,
     as the case may be, reasonable access to its properties, books, records,
     employees and auditors to the extent necessary to permit Seller to
     determine any matter relating to its rights and obligations under this
     Agreement or to any period ending on or before the Closing Date or, in
     relation to any Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entity, the Deferred Date
     applicable to such Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entity, as the case
     may be, (other than in connection with litigation between Buyer and Seller
     regarding the transactions hereunder); provided that such access shall not
     (a) unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer or (b)
     extend to information the disclosure of which could subject Buyer or any of
     its Affiliates to risk of liability or the loss of attorney-client, work
     product or any other legal privilege. Seller shall bear all of the
     out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees, but excluding
     reimbursement for general overhead, salaries and employee benefits)
     reasonably incurred in connection with the foregoing. Seller will hold, and
     will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, directors,
     employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold,
     in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative
     process or by other requirements of Applicable Law, all confidential
     documents and information concerning any Asset Owning Entity or Owner Trust
     provided to it pursuant to this Clause 6.

6.2  Flightlease


                                      -48-

<PAGE>

     6.2.1 Seller shall retain the originals, or copies to the extent originals
          cannot be located or no longer exist, of all documents related to,
          arising out of, or concerning Seller's (or any of its Affiliate's)
          relationship, communications, or transactions with FHG, GFAC, and/or
          Airbus or any Affiliate of Airbus related to the Flightlease
          Litigation (collectively, the "RELEVANT ISSUES"). For purposes of this
          paragraph, the term "documents" is used in the broadest sense
          allowable and includes, all writings, drawings, graphs, charts,
          photographs, phone records, emails, and other printed or electronic
          records from which data can be obtained.

     6.2.2 Buyer shall make reasonably available to Seller, at Seller's request,
          and at Seller's cost, any Transferred Employees for any fact-finding,
          interviews, deposition or other testimony, consultation, or
          discussions concerning the Relevant Issues (or any of them).

     6.2.3 Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller, at Seller's request,
          and at Seller's cost, in the defense of any claims, whether now
          pending or hereafter brought, against Seller, its Affiliates, or any
          Transferred Employees by, or on behalf of, FHG, GFAC, and/or Airbus
          including (a) notifying Seller in writing within three (3) days if
          Seller or any Transferred Employee are served with or otherwise
          receive discovery requests relating to any Relevant Issues; (b)
          entering into a joint defense or other similar agreement mutually
          acceptable to Buyer and Seller; and (c) executing any documents
          reasonably required by Seller that are necessary or appropriate to
          enable Seller to pursue or defend any claims, whether now pending or
          hereafter brought by, or on behalf of, FHG, GFAC, and/or Airbus.

6.3  GATX Name

     Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer
     shall as part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as a
     consequence hereof acquire any rights to use the term "GATX" and agrees to
     cause the Transferred Employees, other than the Deferred Employees, to
     cease using the GATX name or any derivative thereof. Promptly after the
     Closing Date or the Deferred Date, if any, applicable to the relevant
     Specified Ownership Interest, but in no event more than thirty (30) days
     thereafter, Buyer shall change the name of any Asset Owning Entity or Owner
     Trust (or Subsidiary thereof) which includes the term "GATX" to another
     name excluding such term.

6.4  Management Services

     6.4.1 If the Closing has occurred and either (a) a Partnership Asset Owning
          Entity is or becomes a Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entity or an
          Excluded Partnership Asset Owing Entity, or (b) the Specified
          Ownership Interests related to a Partnership Asset Owning Entity have
          transferred to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
          but the JV Management Agreement related to such Partnership Asset
          Owning Entity has not transferred to Buyer on account of the failure
          to obtain the consents necessary for such transfer, Buyer shall
          provide management services with respect to such Partnership Asset
          Owning


                                      -49-

<PAGE>

          Entity (each an "ENTITY"), upon and subject to the terms and
          conditions provided for in Clause 6.4.2.

     6.4.2 The terms and conditions applicable to Buyer's appointment as a
          manager with respect to an Entity are as follows:

          (a)  Seller shall remain liable to such Entity under the JV Management
               Agreement related to such Entity (each a "PRIMARY MANAGEMENT
               AGREEMENT") and Buyer's role will be that of subcontractor.

          (b)  Buyer shall perform for Seller's benefit (for no cost other than
               the pass-through of fees and reimbursable costs payments
               contemplated by Clause 6.4.2(d)) all of the obligations expressed
               to be performed by the "Manager" in such Entity's Primary
               Management Agreement (other than any remarketing obligations
               except such remarketing obligations under any Entity's Primary
               Management Agreement which Seller designates from time to time as
               those to be performed by Buyer) which as if Buyer were named
               therein as the "Manager" and Seller were named therein as the
               "Company".

          (c)  Seller will assume obligations in favour of Buyer on the same
               terms mutatis mutandis as the obligations assumed by such Entity
               in favour of Seller under its Primary Management Agreement, save
               that Seller's obligations to pay fees or reimbursable costs to
               Buyer shall be governed solely by Clause 6.4.2(d).

          (d)  Seller will pay to Buyer all fees and reimbursable costs payments
               received and retained by it from such Entity which are
               attributable to the services performed by Buyer as aforesaid,
               provided that Seller shall be entitled to retain for its own
               account any and all fees and reimbursable cost payments payable
               to it under the applicable Primary Management Agreement which are
               not attributable to the services performed by Buyer as aforesaid.

          (e)  In the event of any failure by Buyer to perform any of the
               obligations in relation to any Primary Management Agreement
               assumed by it pursuant to this Clause 6.4, and so long as such
               failure is continuing and has not been remedied to the reasonable
               satisfaction of Seller within the shorter of (i) the relevant
               remedy period, if any, under the relevant Primary Management
               Agreement and (b) thirty (30) days from the date of Seller giving
               Buyer notice of such failure and requesting the same be remedied,
               Seller may, by giving notice of termination in writing to Buyer,
               terminate Buyer's appointment under this Clause 6.4 in relation
               to such Primary Management Agreement, whereupon such appointment
               shall terminate.

     6.4.3 So long as the relevant remarketing obligations in relation to any
          Return Aircraft have not been designated as aforesaid to be performed
          by Buyer, Seller shall, prior to commencing remarketing activities
          relating to the possible sale of such Return Aircraft, discuss
          remarketing strategies and opportunities for such


                                      -50-

<PAGE>

          Return Aircraft with Buyer, and Buyer and Seller shall, where
          appropriate, agree on Buyer's role (if any) in connection therewith.

6.5  Moneys Received by Buyer Group with respect to Focused Air Aircraft after
     Closing

     If closing of the Focused Air Arrangements is delayed beyond the Closing
     Date (in whole or in part), Buyer will hold all:

     6.5.1 sale and/or rental proceeds received and retained by members of Buyer
          Group with respect to Focused Air Aircraft on trust for Seller and
          will pay such proceeds to Seller promptly after receipt; and

     6.5.2 fees received and retained by members of Buyer Group with respect to
          Focused Air Aircraft under the GATX/CL Air JV Management Agreement or
          otherwise on trust for Seller and will pay such fees to Seller
          promptly after receipt.

     For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby agreed that all assets and amounts
     set forth in Clauses 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 are not being purchased by Buyer are
     and shall remain the property of Seller (including for United States
     federal income tax purposes).

6.6  No Actions by Asset Owning Entities

     Buyer will ensure, to the fullest extent that it is able to do so pursuant
     to contract or otherwise, that no Asset Owing Entity will take any action
     or commence any proceedings against any GATX Retained Entity or any past,
     present or future Officer of any GATX Retained Entity or any Asset Owning
     Entity, in each such case in respect of matters arising or existing on or
     prior to the date hereof.

6.7  Offers to Acquire Partnership Asset Owning Entities

     Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to acquire all of the Ownership
     Interests in each Partnership Asset Owning Entity (other than the Excluded
     Specified Ownership Interests) and in such connection shall make offers to
     each JV Member (other than any GATX Retained Entity) of each Partnership
     Asset Owning Entity to purchase such JV Member's Ownership Interest in such
     Partnership Asset Owning Entity. In no event shall Buyer make an offer to
     such JV Member at a purchase price which is less than the proportion of the
     Partnership Asset Owning Entity Implied Value which the Ownership Interest
     in such Partnership Asset Owning Entity held by such JV Member bears to the
     total of the Ownership Interests in such Partnership Asset Owning Entity.
     For the avoidance of doubt, if Buyer agrees to purchase all of the JV
     Members' Ownership Interests in a particular Partnership Asset Owning
     Entity, the purchase and sale of the Selling Party's Specified Ownership
     Interest in such Partnership Asset Owning Entity shall nonetheless be
     governed by, and consummated in accordance with, this Agreement.

6.8  Management Fees Received by Buyer Group with respect to Contemplated
     Arrangements

     If:

     6.8.1 a Partnership Asset Owning Entity that owns a Contemplated Aircraft
          becomes a Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entity and a Seller
          Party's Specified


                                      -51-

<PAGE>

          Ownership Interest in such Partnership Asset Owning Entity is
          subsequently sold to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement;

     6.8.2 prior to the Deferred Date with respect to such Partnership Asset
          Owning Entity, Seller has substantially negotiated a sale of such
          Contemplated Aircraft to a purchaser; and

     6.8.3 the sale of such Contemplated Aircraft to such purchaser completes
          after such Deferred Date,

     Buyer will hold all fees received and retained by members of Buyer Group
     with respect to such sale under the JV Management Agreement relating to
     such Partnership Asset Owning Entity on trust for Seller and will pay such
     fees to Seller promptly after receipt. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
     hereby agreed that all such fees described in this Clause 6.8 are not being
     purchased by Buyer and are and shall remain the property of Seller
     (including for United States federal income tax purposes).

6.9  Management Services - ATA Aircraft

     6.9.1 If the ATA Aircraft is not sold to Buyer hereunder on or prior to the
          Backstop Date, Buyer shall, if Seller shall request, provide
          management services with respect to the ATA Aircraft upon and subject
          to the terms and conditions provided for in Clause 6.9.2.

     6.9.2 The terms and conditions applicable to Buyer's appointment as a
          manager of the ATA Aircraft are as follows:

          (a)  Buyer shall manage the ATA Aircraft upon and subject to the same

          properly classified as a "partnership" for United States federal
          income tax purposes, and has filed all United States Tax Returns
          consistent with such status.

     8.2.7 Except in the case of the Finance Lease Aircraft, each Corporate
          Entity Owner and Partnership Entity Owner is the "owner", as
          determined for United States federal income tax purposes, of the
          Aircraft set forth in the corresponding Part of Schedule 1 with
          respect to such owner, notwithstanding that such asset may be leased
          to another party, and has filed all United States Tax Returns (to the
          extent any such returns were required to be filed under Applicable
          Law) consistent with such status.

     8.2.8 No Asset Owning Entity or Owner Trust will be required to include any
          item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable
          income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the
          Closing Date as a result of (i) any change in method of accounting for
          a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (other than
          with respect to maintenance reserves), or (ii) to Seller's Knowledge,
          any "CLOSING AGREEMENT" as described in Code Section 7121 (or any
          corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income
          Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date.

     8.2.9 Except in the case of the Finance Lease Aircraft, the person who is
          the owner (or beneficial interest holder, as the case may be) of each
          Disregarded Entity Owner is the "owner", as determined for United
          States federal income tax purposes, of the Aircraft set forth in the
          corresponding Part of Schedule 1 with


                                      -60-

<PAGE>

          respect to such owner, notwithstanding that such assets may be leased
          to another party, and the Disregarded Entity Owner and the owner or
          beneficial interest holder thereof, as the case may be, has filed all
          United States Tax Returns consistent with such status.

     8.2.10 Each lease to which a Finance Lease Aircraft is subject is, for
          United States federal income tax purposes, treated as a secured
          financing arrangement and not a true lease, and Seller has filed all
          United States Tax Returns consistent with such status.

     8.2.11 To Seller's Knowledge, no Asset Owning Entity or Owner Trust has
          given any currently effective waivers extending the statutory period
          of limitation applicable to any Tax Return for any period or agreed to
          an extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency,
          or has in effect any power of attorney or authorization to any other
          Person with respect to Taxes (other than a power of attorney granted
          to a member of the GATX Group in its capacity as tax matters partner
          of such Asset Owning Entity or Owner Trust or in a similar capacity).

     8.2.12 To Seller's Knowledge, no Asset Owning Entity or Owner Trust has any
          Liability for Taxes of any Person as a transferee or successor,
          whether by law, contract, or otherwise.

     8.2.13 To Seller's Knowledge, all monies required to be withheld from
          employees, independent contractors, stockholders, equity holders or
          creditors of each Asset Owning Entity or Owner Trust for Taxes, or
          collected from customers or others as Taxes, have been withheld as
          appropriate and collected and paid, when due, to the appropriate Tax
          Authority, or if such payment is not yet due, an adequate reserve has
          been established for such Taxes.

     8.2.14 To Seller's Knowledge, no Asset Owning Entity or Owner Trust has
          been a United States real property holding corporation within the
          meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) during the applicable period
          specified in Code Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

     8.2.15 No Disregarded Entity Owner or Partnership Entity Owner is engaged
          in a trade or business within the United States within the meaning of
          the Code (determined solely for these purposes as if each Disregarded
          Entity Owner were an entity separate from its owner for United States
          federal income tax purposes).

     8.2.16 To Seller's Knowledge, there have been no significant inter-group
          restructurings or other transactions of Irish entities in respect of
          which Tax relief was required to be claimed from a Tax authority in
          order to avoid a Tax cost.

     8.2.17 To Seller's Knowledge, there are no significant continuing Tax
          indemnities, warranties and representations for the account of GATX
          Group with respect to its wholly owned aircraft portfolio (other than
          as set forth in this Agreement).

8.3  Tax Covenants

     8.3.1 Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared in accordance with
          Applicable Law and timely file all Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax
          Periods of the Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entities and the Wholly Owned
          Aircraft Owner Trusts. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared in
          accordance with Applicable Law and timely file all Tax Returns of the
          Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entities and the Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner
          Trusts for Straddle Periods, provided that at least 30 days before any
          such Tax Return is due (taking into account any extensions obtained)
          Buyer shall provide a copy of the completed return to Seller, and
          Buyer shall make all changes proposed within 15 days by Seller which
          Buyer approves (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
          delayed). Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared in accordance
          with Applicable Law and timely file all Tax Returns of the Wholly
          Owned Asset Owning Entities and the Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trusts
          for Post-Closing Tax Periods. The parties shall cooperate to file the
          Tax Returns of the Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entities and Wholly Owned
          Aircraft Owner Trusts on the basis of a closing of the books as of the
          end of the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.
          The party responsible for filing a Tax Return under the preceding
          sentences of this Clause 8.3.1 shall pay the Tax due with respect to
          that return, provided that the other party shall pay such party, at
          least three business days before the applicable Tax is due, an amount
          equal to the Tax for which the other party is responsible under Clause
          8.6 (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall in all cases be computed in
          accordance with Clause 8.6.3, regardless of whether Applicable Law
          requires or permits a closing of the books as described in such
          clause). The Person that has control thereof under Applicable Law or
          contract shall be responsible for preparing and filing all Tax Returns
          of each Partnership Asset Owning Entity and Partnership Owner Trust
          and for causing those entities and trusts to pay any Taxes owed by
          them with respect to such returns; provided, that if pursuant to
          Applicable Law or contract, Buyer or Seller has control of the
          preparation of an IRS Form 1065 (or, in a case where the filing of
          such form is not required, a document designed to provide the owners
          of the entity or trust with information corresponding to that normally
          included on such form or schedules thereto) or any similar Tax Return
          required under non-United States law for a Partnership Asset Owning
          Entity or Partnership Owner Trust for a Tax period during all or part
          of which the other party or its Affiliates owned an interest in such
          entity or trust, then Buyer or Seller shall prepare such form, return
          or document solely in a manner approved by the other party acting
          reasonably. Buyer shall not file and shall cause its Affiliates not to
          file any amended Tax Return for an Asset Owning Entity or Owner Trust
          for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without the prior
          written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably
          withheld or delayed). For purposes of this Agreement, "Partnership
          Owner Trust" means any Owner Trust that is not a Wholly Owned Aircraft
          Owner Trust.

     8.3.2 Buyer agrees to pay to Seller 50% of the Tax benefit actually
          received by any Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entity or Wholly Owned
          Aircraft Owner Trust,


                                      -62-

<PAGE>

          Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer from the use in any Post-Closing Tax
          Period (or the post-Closing portion of any Straddle Period based on
          the methodology set forth in Clause 8.6.3) of a carryforward of any
          Tax Asset (but only to the extent such Tax Asset is set forth on
          Schedule 9-8.3.2), by a Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entity or Wholly
          Owned Aircraft Owner Trust from a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the
          pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period based on the methodology
          set forth in Clause 8.6.3). Seller agrees to pay to Buyer 50% of the
          Tax benefit actually received by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
          from the use in any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the pre-Closing portion
          of any Straddle Period based on the methodology set forth in Clause
          8.6.3) of a carryback of any Tax Asset of a Wholly Owned Asset Owning
          Entity or Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trust arising in a Post-Closing
          Tax Period (or the post-Closing portion of any Straddle Period based
          on the methodology set forth in Clause 8.6.3). In each case, such
          benefit actually received shall be considered equal to the excess of
          (i) the amount of Taxes that would have been payable by a Wholly Owned
          Asset Owning Entity or Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trust, Seller,
          Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer or Seller, as applicable, in the
          absence of the carryforward or carryback of the applicable Tax Asset
          over (ii) the amount of Taxes actually payable by such Wholly Owned
          Asset Owning Entity, Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trust, Seller, Buyer
          or Affiliate of Buyer or Seller, as applicable. Payment of an amount
          under the preceding sentences of this Clause 8.3.2 in respect of a Tax
          benefit shall be made within 30 days of the filing of the applicable
          Tax Return or any adjustment for the Tax year in which the Tax Asset
          is utilized. If, subsequent to the payment of any amount under this
          Clause 8.3.2, there shall be (a) a final determination of a Tax
          liability that, under Applicable Law, is not subject to further
          appeal, review or modification through proceedings or otherwise, which
          results in a disallowance or a reduction of the Tax Asset so carried
          forward or back, as applicable, or (b) otherwise a reduction in the
          amount of the Tax benefit realized by the Wholly Owned Asset Owning
          Entity or Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trust, Seller, Buyer or
          Affiliate of Buyer or Seller, as applicable, from such Tax Asset, then
          any amount which would not have been payable pursuant to this Clause
          8.3.2 had the amount of the benefit been determined in light of such
          events shall be repaid within 30 days of such event described in (a)
          or (b). In addition, to the extent that an event described in (a)
          results in any obligation by the party entitled to repayment (or an
          Affiliate of such party) to pay any penalty or interest, the other
          party shall hold such party harmless for 50% of such penalty and
          interest. Any amount required to be paid pursuant to the preceding
          sentence shall be paid within 10 days of the payment by such party of
          any such interest or penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
          case of any Tax Asset of a Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entity or Wholly
          Owned Aircraft Owner Trust that can be carried back to a Pre-Closing
          Tax Period (or pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period based on the
          methodology set forth in Clause 8.6.3), Buyer shall not and shall not
          cause its Affiliates or any Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entity or Wholly
          Owned Aircraft Owner Trust to carry back such Tax Asset to a
          Pre-Closing Tax Period or such pre-Closing portion of a Straddle
          Period without the


                                      -63-

<PAGE>

          prior written consent of Seller, except to the extent required under
          Applicable Law.

     8.3.3 Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, and shall cause their Affiliates to
          cooperate, to use reasonable efforts to avoid recapture by Seller or
          any of its Affiliates under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1503-2 of
          any dual consolidated losses attributable to the Asset Owning Entities
          and Owner Trusts. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that an
          Affiliate of Buyer treated as a domestic corporation for United States
          Tax purposes (or a disregarded entity wholly owned by such a domestic
          corporation) acquires a Specified Ownership Interest in an Asset
          Owning Entity or Owner Trust from a Selling Party, Buyer and Seller
          each shall use reasonable efforts to cause their Affiliates to enter
          into a closing agreement pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
          1.1503-2 to avoid recapture of the dual consolidated losses (if any)
          attributable to that Asset Owning Entity or Owner Trust; provided,
          that neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall be required to take any
          actions under this Clause 8.3.3 that would have a Material Adverse
          Effect on Buyer or its Affiliates.

     8.3.4 Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause Post Street Leasing Ltd. to
          elect under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(c) to be treated
          for United States federal income tax purposes as an entity disregarded
          as separate from its owner. In addition, prior to the Closing, Seller
          may cause any one or more of the entities listed in Part 5 of Schedule
          2 to elect under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(c) to be
          treated for United States federal income tax purposes as an entity
          disregarded as separate from its owner.

8.4  Tax Sharing Agreements

     On the Closing Date, all Tax Sharing Agreements between (i) the Asset
     Owning Entities and Owner Trusts, on the one hand; and (ii) Seller or any
     of its Affiliates (other than the Asset Owning Entities and Owner Trusts),
     on the other hand, shall be terminated effective as of the close of the
     Closing Date and have no further effect for any taxable year or period
     (whether a past, present or future year or period), and no additional
     payments shall be made thereunder. Seller and Buyer shall take all such
     steps necessary to ensure that such termination is effective.

8.5  Cooperation

     Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
     requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation and filing
     of any Tax Return, any audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and
     any other matter relating to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
     retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
     information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit or other
     proceeding or other Tax matter (including, without limitation, information
     reasonably sufficient to enable Buyer or Seller to determine whether it is
     entitled to any payment under Clause 8.3.2 in respect of a Tax Asset and
     the amount of any such payment) and making employees available on a
     mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
     of any material provided hereunder. Buyer and Seller agree (i) to retain
     all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Asset


                                      -64-

<PAGE>

     Owning Entities and the Owner Trusts relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
     or Straddle Period for at least six (6) years after the end of the taxable
     year which includes the Closing Date, and to abide by all record retention
     agreements entered into with any Tax Authority, and (ii) to give the other
     party reasonable written notice prior to destroying or discarding any such
     books and records and, if the other party so requests, Buyer or Seller, as
     the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such
     books and records. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer's obligations
     under this Clause 8.5 shall include causing the Asset Owning Entities and
     Owner Trusts to execute Tax Returns prepared by Seller pursuant to Clause
     8.3 and granting such powers of attorney as are reasonably requested by
     Seller to evidence its authority to control audits and other proceedings
     pursuant to Clause 8.6. Buyer and Seller will, upon Buyer's request,
     cooperate in the preparation and filing of elections under Section 338(g)
     or Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, as applicable, with respect to the sale
     of "stock" (for U.S. tax purposes) from Seller to Buyer in any Wholly Owned
     Asset Owning Entity hereunder to the extent the requirements for such
     elections are met, and Seller will, upon Buyer's request, cooperate in
     using all reasonable efforts to procure the preparation and filing of an
     election under Section 754 of the Code with respect to the sale of a
     "partnership interest" (for U.S. tax purposes) in any Partnership Entity
     Owner. In addition, Buyer will, upon Seller's request, use reasonable
     efforts to cooperate in reducing the amount, if any, of taxable income that
     is recognized or Tax that is incurred by Seller, any of its Affiliates, the
     Asset Owning Entities or Owner Trusts as a result of taking the actions
     described in Clause 5.3 to the extent that such cooperation would not have
     an adverse effect on Buyer.

8.6  Indemnification

     8.6.1 Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and its Affiliates against and agrees
          to hold them harmless from any (i) Tax of the Wholly Owned Asset
          Owning Entities and Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trusts with respect to
          a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of a Straddle
          Period (as determined under Clause 8.6.3), and any Tax resulting from
          the arrangements described in Clause 6.5, or imposed on or with
          respect to fees held in trust for Seller under Clause 6.8, (ii) Tax
          for which any Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entity or Wholly Owned
          Aircraft Owner Trust is liable as a result of being a member of an
          affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of any Person
          during a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) Taxes ("COVERED TAXES") that
          result from or arise out of the failure of any representation or
          warranty contained in Clause 8.2 to be true and correct as of the
          Closing Date (including Taxes relating to the Section 481 adjustment
          relating to maintenance reserves in respect of Wholly-Owned Asset
          Owning Entities or Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trusts) (it being
          understood that in the case of any Tax of a Partnership Asset Owning
          Entity or Partnership Owner Trust that results from or arises out of
          the failure of any representation or warranty contained in Clause 8.2
          to be true and correct as of the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
          which is a Covered Tax shall equal the product of (x) the full amount
          of Tax incurred by such entity or trust that results from or arises
          out of such failure multiplied by (y) the GATX Group's combined
          percentage ownership of the equity interests in such entity or trust

          immediately prior to the Closing Date), provided that (A) the
          aggregate amount of indemnification which Seller is required to pay in
          respect of all Covered Taxes is limited to $25 million and, for the
          avoidance of doubt, subject to the two (2) year survival period
          contained in Clause 8.10, (B) Seller shall be required to pay
          indemnification in respect of a Covered Tax only if, and to the extent
          that, such Covered Tax exceeds $1 million, and (C) the survival period
          for the representations and warranties contained in Clause 8.2 shall
          be as set forth in Clause 8.10, and (iv) liabilities, costs,
          penalties, interest, and expenses (including, without limitation,
          reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and
          expenses), arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or
          assertion of any Tax described in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the sum of (i)
          through (iv) being referred to as a "BUYER TAX LOSS"); provided, that
          Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates for
          (x) any Transfer Tax, (y) any Buyer Tax Loss that is reflected as a
          liability (other than a deferred Tax liability) in the GATX Air
          Quarterly Operating Report for June 2006 (Document 3.02.10 in the
          Virtual Data Room, which document contains information used to compute
          the June 30th Balance Sheet), or that is incurred with respect to
          income, receipts, gains or profits realized in the ordinary course of
          business after June 30, 2006 (but excluding from this clause (y) for
          avoidance of doubt any Buyer Tax Loss incurred in respect of income,
          receipts, gains or profits realized with respect to the sale and
          transactions expressly required by this Agreement as the same may be
          amended from time to time) or (z) any Buyer Tax Loss that results from
          a breach of Clause 8.3.3 or from actions taken with respect to the
          Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entities or Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner
          Trusts, their assets or businesses outside the ordinary course of
          business after the Closing.

     8.6.2 Buyer agrees to hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against and
          agrees to hold them harmless from (i) any Tax of the Wholly Owned
          Asset Owning Entities or Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trusts with
          respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period or the post-Closing portion of
          any Straddle Period, (ii) any Tax resulting from a breach of Clause
          8.3.3 or from actions taken with respect to the Wholly Owned Asset
          Owning Entities or Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trusts, their assets or
          business outside the ordinary course of business after the Closing,
          (iii) all Transfer Taxes and (iv) any liabilities, costs, expenses
          (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation
          and attorney's fees and expenses), losses, damages, assessments,
          settlements or judgments arising out of or incident to the imposition,
          assessment or assertion of any Tax described in clause (i), (ii) or
          (iii) above (the sum of (i) through (iv) being referred to as a
          "Seller Tax Loss").

     8.6.3 For purposes of this Clause 8, income, deductions, and other items in
          respect of a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the
          pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period and the post-Closing
          portion of such Straddle Period based on an actual closing of the
          books of the relevant entity as of the end of the Closing Date;
          provided, however, that in closing the books, Taxes (such as property

          transactional basis shall be allocated on a daily basis.

     8.6.4 Any payment pursuant to this Clause 8.6 shall be made not later than
          20 days after receipt by the indemnifying party of written notice from
          the indemnified party stating that any Buyer Tax Loss or Seller Tax
          Loss, as the case may be, has been paid and the amount thereof and of
          the indemnity payment requested. Indemnity payments under this Clause
          8.6 shall be adjusted on account of Tax Benefits as provided in Clause
          8.7.

     8.6.5 If a Person entitled to indemnification under this Clause 8.6 (the
          "Tax Indemnified Party") is notified of the commencement of any audit
          or other administrative or judicial proceeding in respect Taxes for
          which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Clause 8.6, then that
          Person shall inform the indemnifying party (the "Tax Indemnifying
          Party") in writing of such proceeding within twenty (20) days after
          the Tax Indemnified Party has been so notified, and the Tax
          Indemnified Party shall give the Tax Indemnifying Party such
          information with respect thereto as the indemnifying party may
          reasonably request. The Tax Indemnifying Party may discharge, at any
          time, its indemnification obligation under this Clause 8.6 by paying
          to the Tax Indemnified Party the amount payable pursuant to this
          Clause 8.6 calculated on the date of such payment. Except in cases
          where the Tax Indemnifying Party has discharged its obligation
          pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Tax Indemnifying Party may, at
          its own expense, participate in and, upon notice to the Tax
          Indemnified Party, take control of the conduct of any such audit or
          other administrative or judicial proceeding; provided, however, that
          if the Tax Indemnifying Party enters into any settlement of such audit
          or other administrative or judicial proceeding without the consent of
          the Tax Indemnified Party and such settlement results in a material
          increase in Taxes for which the Tax Indemnified Party is responsible
          under Clause 8.6.1 or Clause 8.6.2, then the Tax Indemnifying Party
          shall indemnify and hold harmless the Tax Indemnified Party against
          such material increase. If the Tax Indemnifying Party takes control of
          the conduct of such audit or other administrative or judicial
          proceeding, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have the sole discretion
          as to the conduct of such audit or other proceeding. Whether or not
          the Tax Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any claim,
          all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
          prosecution thereof. The Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
          under this Clause 8.6 for any settlements effected without the consent
          of the Tax Indemnifying Party, or resulting from any audit or other
          administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to which the Tax
          Indemnifying Party was not notified in accordance with this Clause
          8.6.5.

     8.6.6 Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, this
          Clause 8.6 shall be the sole indemnification available to Seller,
          Buyer, their Affiliates, the Asset Owning Entities and the Owner
          Trusts in respect of any matters relating to Taxes and, for avoidance
          of doubt, Clauses 11.2.1, 11.2.2 and 11.3 shall not apply in respect
          of such matters.

8.7  Tax Benefits

     If any indemnification obligation under Clause 8.6 or Clause 11.2 arises in
     respect of a loss, a liability or a judgment or other disposition of an
     administrative or judicial proceeding (including an audit) which, or the
     payment of which, results in there being allowable to the indemnified party
     or any of its Affiliates any deduction, amortization, exclusion from income
     or other allowance, after taking into account any income, gain, recapture
     or other inclusion in income or reduction in allowance resulting from the
     indemnification payment due (a "TAX BENEFIT") then any payment under Clause
     8.6 or under Clause 11.2 shall be an amount equal to (x) the amount
     otherwise due but for this Clause 8.7 minus (y) the present value of the
     Tax Benefit multiplied by the maximum U.S. federal, state, local or
     non-U.S., as the case may be, corporate Tax rate in effect at the time the
     relevant adjustment is made or, in the case of a credit, by 100 per cent
     (100%). The present value referred to in the preceding sentence shall be
     determined using a discount rate equal to the mid-term applicable federal
     rate in effect at the time the relevant adjustment is made and assuming
     that the Tax Benefit will be used at the earliest date or dates allowable
     by Applicable Law.

8.8  Refunds

     Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller any refunds of Taxes of a
     Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entity or Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trust for
     any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle
     Period) that are received by Buyer, any of its Affiliates any Wholly Owned
     Asset Owning Entity or Wholly Owned Aircraft Owner Trust within 10 days
     after the receipt of such refund. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to
     Buyer any refunds of Taxes of a Wholly Owned Asset Owning Entity or Wholly
     Owned Aircraft Owner Trust for any Post-Closing Tax Period (or the
     post-Closing portion of any Straddle Period) that are received by Seller or
     any of its Affiliates within 10 days after the receipt of such refund.

8.9  Treatment as Purchase Price Adjustment

     Any amount paid by Seller or Buyer under Clause 8.6 or Clause 11.2 will be
     treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

8.10 Survival

     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the covenants
     and agreements contained in Clause 8 shall survive for the full period of
     all statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
     extension thereof); provided, however, that the representations and
     warranties contained in Clause 8.2 shall survive until the second
     anniversary of the Closing Date.

          (a)  The parties confirm that the transactions contemplated by this
               Agreement will lead to the transfer of the contracts of
               employment of the UK Employees to Buyer (or such Affiliate of
               Buyer as Buyer may nominate) under and in accordance with the UK
               Transfer Regulations and accordingly such contracts have such
               effect from Closing as if originally made between the UK
               Employees and Buyer UK Employer.

          (b)  Buyer confirms that it has provided to Seller in writing all such
               information as may be necessary to enable Seller to comply with
               its obligation to inform and/or consult with the UK Employees'
               representatives pursuant to the UK Transfer Regulations and shall
               indemnify Seller in respect of each Liability and cost arising
               from a failure to do so in accordance with Clause 11.3. Seller
               shall procure that the current employer of the UK Employees shall
               comply fully with the UK Transfer Regulations and Buyer shall be
               indemnified by Seller, in accordance with Clause 11.3, in respect
               to any Liability which it or any Affiliate of Buyer sustains as a
               result of Seller or its Affiliates failure to comply with such
               regulations in relation to this transaction.

          (c)  In the event that any UK Undisclosed Employee asserts or
               establishes that his employment has transferred to Buyer or an
               Affiliate of Buyer pursuant to the UK Transfer Regulations upon
               Closing Buyer shall within seven (7) days of being so informed
               either by the UK Undisclosed Employee or by Seller (whichever is
               the earlier) inform Seller whether or not it (or any Affiliate)
               wishes to continue employing the UK Undisclosed Employee. If
               Buyer does not want the UK Undisclosed Employee to be so employed
               Seller shall within seven (7) days of being so advised be
               entitled to offer employment to the UK Undisclosed Employee at
               its sole discretion. In the event that (i) such an offer is not
               made or (ii) such an offer is made and not accepted by the UK
               Undisclosed Employee then Buyer shall be entitled to terminate
               the UK Undisclosed Employee's employment and in such event Buyer
               shall be indemnified by Seller, in accordance with Clause 11.3,
               in respect of any Liability which it or any Affiliate of Buyer
               may sustain arising under or in connection with the UK
               Undisclosed Employee's contract of employment and the termination
               thereof.

          (d)  Except to the extent necessary to allow Buyer to terminate
               employment pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section,
               Buyer and Buyer UK Employer shall comply fully with all UK
               Transfer Regulations and Seller shall be indemnified by Buyer, in
               accordance with Clause 11.3, in respect to any Liability which it
               or any Affiliate of Seller may sustain as a result of Buyer or
               its Affiliates failure to comply with such regulations.

          (e)  The parties recognize that Buyer UK Employer does not currently
               know whether it will continue the employment of some or all of
               the UK Employees after the Closing and Buyer shall notify Seller
               as soon as is reasonably practical of its intentions regarding UK
               Employees. If Buyer UK Employer terminates the employment of a UK
               Employee within forty


                                      -69-

<PAGE>

               five (45) days after the Closing ("termination"), it shall
               provide Seller with advance written notice of such termination
               ten (10) business days prior to issuance of the notice of
               termination to the UK Employee. The parties shall cooperate with
               one another in determining the terms of the termination to be
               provided to the UK Employee and Buyer shall, if Seller so
               requests, require that as a condition of receiving the payments
               that have been agreed (in addition to such payments as are
               legally required), the UK Employee enters into a statutory
               compromise agreement, agreeing to waive all claims for unfair
               dismissal. Buyer or Buyer UK Employer may not offer any payments
               to a UK Employee in connection with the termination without
               Seller's prior consent and approval, such consent and approval
               not to be unreasonably withheld. Further, Buyer shall procure
               that Buyer UK Employer follows the statutory dismissal procedure
               as Seller may reasonably request; provided, however, that the
               parties shall cooperate with one another in effecting the
               termination within forty five (45) days of the Closing. Seller
               shall, subject to written evidence of payment being made,
               reimburse Buyer UK Employer the costs of (i) any payment of
               salary or benefits in lieu of notice, (ii) statutory redundancy
               pay, and (subject in the case of items (iii) and (iv) below to
               Buyer having complied with its obligations under this Clause
               9.1.1(e)), (iii) any additional amounts paid to the UK Employee
               under the terms agreed above and (iv) the damages, compensation
               and costs payable to the UK Employee as ordered by a court or
               tribunal that arise out of the termination being found to be an
               unfair dismissal. In the event that Buyer or Buyer UK Employer is
               sued in connection with the termination, the provisions of Clause
               11.3 shall apply to the claim. Buyer or Buyer UK Employer is
               responsible for any damages, compensation and costs that arise in
               connection with any employment claim (other than an unfair
               dismissal claim) made by the UK Employee as a result of said
               termination and shall reimburse Seller or its Affiliate for any
               damages or costs it incurs as a result of such claims. Other than
               as expressly set forth herein, Seller shall have no liability to
               Buyer or Buyer UK Employer for actions taken with respect to UK
               Employees subsequent to the Closing.

     9.1.2 France

          (a)  The parties confirm that the transactions contemplated by this
               Agreement will lead to the transfer of the contracts of
               employment of the French Employees to Buyer (or such Affiliate of
               Buyer as Buyer may nominate) under and in accordance with the
               French Transfer Regulations and accordingly such contracts have
               such effect from Closing as if originally made between the French
               Employees and Buyer French Employer.

          (b)  Buyer confirms that it has provided to Seller in writing all such
               information as may be necessary to enable Seller to comply with
               its obligation to inform the French Employees pursuant to the
               French Transfer Regulations and shall indemnify Seller in respect
               of each Liability arising from a failure to do so in accordance
               with Clause 11.3.


                                      -70-

               Seller shall procure that the current employer of the French
               Employees shall comply fully with the French Transfer Regulations
               and Buyer shall be indemnified by Seller, in accordance with
               Clause 11.3, in respect to any Liability which it or any
               Affiliate of Buyer sustains as a result of Seller or its
               Affiliates failure to comply with such regulations in relation to
               this transaction.

          (c)  In the event that any French Undisclosed Employee asserts or
               establishes that his employment has transferred to Buyer or an
               Affiliate of Buyer pursuant to the French Transfer Regulations
               upon Closing Buyer shall within seven (7) days of being so
               informed either by the French Undisclosed Employee or by Seller
               (whichever is the earlier) inform Seller whether or not it (or
               any Affiliate) wishes to continue employing the French
               Undisclosed Employee. If Buyer does not want the French
               Undisclosed Employee to be so employed Seller shall within seven
               (7) days of being so advised be entitled to offer employment to
               the French Undisclosed Employee at its sole discretion. In the
               event that (a) such an offer is not made or (b) such an offer is
               made and not accepted by the French Undisclosed Employee then
               Buyer shall be entitled to terminate the French Undisclosed
               Employee's employment and in such event Buyer shall be
               indemnified by Seller, in accordance with Clause 11.3, in respect
               of any Liability which it or any Affiliate of Buyer may sustain
               arising under or in connection with the French Undisclosed
               Employee's contract of employment and the termination thereof.

          (d)  Except to the extent necessary to allow Buyer to terminate
               employment pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section,
               Buyer and Buyer French Employer shall comply with all French
               Transfer Regulations and Seller shall be indemnified by Buyer, in
               accordance with Clause 11.3, in respect of any Liability which it
               or any Affiliate of Seller may sustain as a result of Buyer or
               its Affiliates failure to comply with such regulations.

          (e)  The parties recognize that Buyer French Employer does not
               currently know whether it will continue the employment of some or
               all of the French Employees after the Closing and Buyer shall
               notify Seller as soon as is reasonably practical of its
               intentions regarding French Employees. If Buyer French Employer
               initiates the termination procedure for redundancy of a French
               Employee within forty five (45) days after the Closing
               ("termination"), it shall provide Seller with advance written
               notice of the commencement of the redundancy procedure ten (10)
               business days prior to such commencement for the French Employee.
               The parties shall cooperate with one another in preparing the
               terms of the termination for the French Employee and Buyer shall
               if Seller so requests, require that as a condition of receiving
               the payments that have been agreed (in addition to such payments
               as are legally required), the French Employee enters into a
               legally binding settlement agreement, agreeing to waive all
               claims for unfair dismissal. Buyer or Buyer French Employer may
               not offer any payments to a French Employee beyond what he is
               legally entitled to in


                                      -71-

               connection with the termination without Seller's prior consent
               and approval, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
               Further, Buyer shall procure that Buyer French Employer follows
               such dismissal procedure as Seller may require. Seller shall,
               subject to written evidence of payment being made, reimburse
               Buyer French Employer the costs of (i) any payment of salary or
               benefits in lieu of notice, (ii) payments in respect of severance
               due by law or pursuant to the applicable collective bargaining
               agreement, and (subject in the case of items (iii) and (iv) below
               to Buyer having complied with its obligations under this Clause
               9.1.2(e)), (iii) any additional amounts paid to the French
               Employee under the terms agreed above, and (iv) the damages,
               compensation and costs payable to the French Employee as ordered
               by a court or tribunal that result from the termination being
               found to be an unfair dismissal. In the event that Buyer or Buyer
               French Employer is sued in connection with the termination, the
               provisions of Clause 11.3 shall apply to the claim. Buyer or
               Buyer French Employer is responsible for any damages,
               compensation and costs that arise in connection with any
               employment claim (other than the termination is held unfair) made
               by the French Employee regarding the performance of his contract
               of employment or as a result of any other termination and shall
               reimburse Seller or its Affiliate for any damages or costs it
               incurs as a result of such claims. Other than as expressly set
               forth herein, Seller shall have no liability to Buyer or Buyer
               French Employer for actions taken with respect to French
               Employees subsequent to the Closing.

     9.1.3 United States

          (a)  Seller shall make available to Buyer all U.S. Employees for the
               purposes of interviewing and, if desired by Buyer, hiring. Any
               offers of employment shall (i) be at a compensation level that is
               substantially comparable in the aggregate to the total
               compensation the U.S. Employee is receiving as of the Closing
               Date, (ii) provide for employment at a location that is less than
               fifty (50) miles from the U.S. Employee's U.S. work location as
               of the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Deferred Transfer
               Date, as defined below) (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
               that for any U.S. Employee who is working outside the United
               States (as of the Closing Date or, if applicable, the Deferred
               Transfer Date), such offer of employment will be at a location
               within fifty (50) miles of the San Francisco, California,
               metropolitan area) and (iii) provide for continued and
               uninterrupted employment for the U.S. Employee prior to, on and
               after the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Deferred Transfer
               Date). Buyer shall provide any offer of employment to any
               affected employee in writing (with a copy to Seller) at least
               fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date. Any such offers
               shall contain such terms and conditions of employment with Buyer
               or any applicable Affiliate of Buyer, and Seller shall cooperate
               in providing Buyer with an opportunity to communicate such offers
               to such affected employees. The employees who accept and

               Discharged (in each case within the meaning of Seller Severance
               Plan) within one (1) year of the Closing Date (or, if applicable,
               the Deferred Transfer Date), Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any
               amounts paid by Seller or its Affiliates under Seller Severance
               Plan as a result thereof; provided, however, Seller shall provide
               Buyer with notice of any claim under Seller Severance Plan and
               will cooperate with Buyer in connection with the settlement of
               such claim. Seller shall otherwise generally have no Liability
               for any actions taken by Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) on or
               after the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the Deferred Transfer
               Date) with respect to any Transferred U.S. Employee. Buyer shall
               have no Liability for any actions taken by Seller (or any of its
               Affiliates) prior to the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the
               Deferred Transfer Date) with respect to any employee of the
               Business, unless Seller's actions are requested by, or required
               by, Buyer or otherwise contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer
               shall promptly reimburse Seller for any amounts paid by Seller or
               any of its Affiliates to any U.S. Employees under the Worker
               Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended.
               Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, upon the Closing, there are
               Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entities and/or Excluded
               Partnership Asset Owning Entities, then, at Seller's option, it
               shall be permitted to designate up to eight (8) of the U.S.
               Employees identified with the sign # in Part 3 of Schedule 7, or
               as otherwise agreed to between Seller and Buyer, as "DEFERRED
               EMPLOYEES". If a Deferred Employee is a Transferred U.S.
               Employee, then such employee shall not become an employee of
               Buyer on the Closing Date, but rather shall remain an employee of
               Seller until March 31, 2007 or such other date as may agreed by
               Seller and Buyer (the "DEFERRED TRANSFER DATE"), at which time
               such employee shall become an employee of Buyer upon the terms
               and conditions set forth in this Clause 9.1.3(a).

          (b)  Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its
               commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Transferred U.S.
               Employee with full eligibility and vesting credit for all
               purposes under Buyer employee benefit plans, programs, policies
               and arrangements (including any Buyer vacation and severance
               policies), for pre-Closing (i) service with Seller and its
               Affiliates, and (ii) service credited under the comparable Seller
               employee benefit plans for employment other than with Seller and
               its Affiliates; provided, however, that in no event shall Buyer
               or any Affiliate be required to provide any service credit to any
               Transferred U.S. Employee to the extent the provision of such
               credit would result in any duplication of benefits. To the extent
               possible, Buyer shall (i) cause any pre-existing condition,
               restrictions or waiting period under Buyer's plans to be waived
               (to the extent satisfied or waived under Seller's applicable
               plans) and (ii) honor any deductible and out-of-pocket expenses
               incurred


                                      -73-

               by Transferred U.S. Employees and their dependants under Seller's
               benefit plan during the portion of the calendar year preceding
               the Closing Date.

11.2 Indemnification


                                      -76-

<PAGE>

     11.2.1 Effective at and after the Closing or the Deferred Closing, as the
          case may be, Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and its Affiliates
          against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all
          damage, loss or expense (including reasonable expenses of
          investigation and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) ("DAMAGES")
          incurred or suffered by Buyer or any of its Affiliates arising out of
          (a) any breach of the representations or warranties of Seller (each
          such breach, a "WARRANTY BREACH"), (b) any breach of covenant or
          agreement made or to be performed by Seller pursuant to this
          Agreement, or (c) any Retained Liability; provided that Seller shall
          not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to this
          Clause 11.2.1 (other than pursuant to the foregoing clause (c)) unless
          (A) such claim involves Damages in excess of three hundred thousand
          Dollars ($300,000) (an "INDEMNIFIABLE LOSS") and (B) the aggregate
          amount of all Indemnifiable Losses of Buyer upon which valid claims
          are based pursuant to such clause exceeds six million Dollars
          ($6,000,000) (the "BASKET AMOUNT"), and then Seller shall only be
          responsible for indemnification of Indemnifiable Losses in excess of
          fifty per cent. (50%) of the Basket Amount; provided further, that,
          the amounts paid by Seller for indemnification of Indemnifiable Losses
          under this Agreement pursuant to this Clause 11.2.1 (other than any
          amounts paid by Buyer to third-party claimants in connection with any
          Retained Liabilities) shall be limited to, in the aggregate, an amount
          equal to one hundred and twenty five million Dollars ($125,000,000).
          The limitations on indemnification contained in this Clause 11.2.1
          shall not apply to Damages that arise out of a breach of
          representations and warranties contained in Clauses 3.1, 3.2, 3.4.1,
          3.5 or 3.9.1; provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate
          amount of Damages arising out of breaches of such representations and
          warranties for which Seller is liable for indemnification under this
          Clause 11.2.1, together with the aggregate amount of all other Damages
          for which Seller is liable for indemnification under this Clause
          11.2.1, exceed the net amount of the Purchase Price received and
          retained by Seller.

     11.2.2 Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and its Affiliates against and
          agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages actually
          suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates and their respective
          officers, directors, employees, successors and permitted assigns in
          connection with, arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of
          the representations and warranties of Buyer, (ii) any breach of or
          failure to comply with any covenant or agreement made or to be
          performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) any Assumed
          Liability or (iv) the ownership by Seller or its Affiliates of the
          Transferred Specified Ownership Interests.

     11.2.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause 11.2, Clause
          8.6 shall be the sole indemnification available to Seller, Buyer,
          their Affiliates, the Asset Owning Entities and the Owner Trusts in
          respect of all matters relating to Taxes, and the limitations set
          forth in this Clause 11.2 shall not apply.

11.3 Procedures


                                      -77-

<PAGE>

     11.3.1 The party seeking indemnification under Clause 11.2 (the
          "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") agrees to give prompt notice to the party against
          whom indemnity is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of the assertion
          of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
          (each, a "CLAIM") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
          that Clause and will provide the Indemnifying Party with all
          information that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The
          failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
          Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Agreement, except to
          the extent that such failure shall have materially adversely
          prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

     11.3.2 Subject to the terms of this Clause 11.3.2, the Indemnifying Party
          shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim asserted
          by any third party (each, a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM") and, subject only to
          the express limitations set forth in this Clause 11.3, shall be
          entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for that defense, in each
          case at its expense. If the Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge, in
          writing, to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party shall be
          obligated under the terms of its indemnity hereunder in connection
          with such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
          entitled (a) to take control of the defense and investigation of such
          lawsuit or action (including the right to settle any such law suit or
          action) and, (b) to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice
          reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to handle and defend
          the same unless the named parties to such action or proceeding include
          both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the
          Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that joint
          counsel for the Indemnified Party and the relevant Indemnifying Party
          shall result in a conflict under the applicable rules of professional
          conduct, in which event the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at
          the Indemnifying Party's expense to separate counsel of its own choice
          reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party; provided that the
          Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any compromise or settlement
          with respect to the Third Party Claim that (i) does not include a
          complete release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with
          respect thereto (other than liability or damages that would be paid by
          the Indemnifying Party pursuant to the terms hereof) and/or (ii)
          imposes any liability on or damages the property of the Indemnified
          Party without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
          shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnified Party
          may, at its own cost, participate in (but not control) the
          investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim and any
          appeal arising therefrom. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume
          the defense of such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) calendar days
          after receipt of the notice of claim by the Indemnified Party, the
          Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been
          asserted will (upon delivering notice to such effect to the
          Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying
          Party's cost, risk and expense, the defense of such Third Party Claim
          on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party.
          In no event shall the Indemnified Party have authority to settle any
          Third Party Claim without the consent of the


                                      -78-

<PAGE>

          Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
          or delayed.

     11.3.3 If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any Third Party
          Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of
          such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to
          any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with
          respect to such Third Party Claim.

     11.3.4 Each party shall cooperate in good faith, and cause their respective
          Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third
          Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such personnel,
          records, information and testimony, and attend those conferences,
          discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
          reasonably requested in connection with any of the foregoing.

     11.3.5 Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
          to mitigate any loss for which that Indemnified Party seeks
          indemnification under this Agreement. If that Indemnified Party
          mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the
          Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of this
          Agreement in respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party must notify
          the Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of
          the value of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation
          (less the Indemnified Party's reasonable costs of mitigation) within
          five (5) Business Days after the benefit is received.

     11.3.6 Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
          to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any
          other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under
          Clause 11.2.

11.4 Calculation of Damages

     11.4.1 The amount of any Damages payable under Clause 11.2 by the
          Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (a) amounts actually received
          by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from
          any other Person alleged to be responsible therefore, and (b) Tax
          Benefit allowable to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
          calculated in accordance with the principles set forth in Clause 8.7.
          If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
          insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible
          for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
          Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly
          reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense
          incurred by that Indemnifying Party in connection with providing that
          indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified
          Party, net of any expenses incurred by that Indemnified Party in
          collecting that amount.

     11.4.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
          Agreement, in no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any
          Indemnified Party for any incidental, consequential, indirect,
          special, punitive, exemplary or other similar Damages (including loss
          of future revenue, income or profits, diminution of

          value or loss of business reputation or opportunity) in connection
          with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, unless
          such Damages are part of the Damages suffered by the Indemnified Party
          in connection with a Third Party Claim and awarded by a court of
          competent jurisdiction.

11.5 Assignment of Claims

     If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in
     respect of any Damages pursuant to Clause 11.2 and the Indemnified Party
     could have recovered all or a part of those Damages from a third party
     (each, a "POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTOR") based on the underlying Claim asserted
     against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign those of
     its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to
     permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the
     amount of that payment.

11.6 Exclusivity

     Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the
     Closing, Buyer waives any rights and claims Buyer or any of its Affiliates
     may have against Seller or any of its Affiliates, whether in law, in equity
     or otherwise, relating to any Asset Owning Entity, Owner Trusts, the
     Specified Ownership Interests, the Additional Assets or the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement. The rights and claims waived by Buyer
     include claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of
     or relating to claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or
     warranty, negligent misrepresentation other claims for breach of duty and
     all other claims under any other theory of law or equity. After the
     Closing, Clauses 11.2, 8.6.1 and 13.10 will provide the sole and exclusive
     remedy for Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

11.7 Professional Liability Insurance

     If, at any time during which Buyer continues to provide management services
     to Seller in accordance with Clause 6.4, the net worth of Buyer is less
     than one hundred million Dollars ($100,000,000), Buyer shall promptly
     provide to Seller reasonably satisfactory evidence that Buyer has in effect
     professional liability insurance of such type and with such limits as is
     customary for Persons providing services such as those contemplated by
     Clause 6.4.

11.8 Third Party Liability Insurances

     For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date or the relevant
     Deferred Date, as the case may be, Buyer shall ensure that Seller and each
     of its Affiliates and each director, officer, agent and servant of Seller
     and each of its Affiliate is a named contract party under contingent third
     party aviation liability insurances effected by or on behalf of Buyer with
     insurers reasonably satisfactory to Seller and of such types and with such
     limits as is customary for Persons engaged in the aircraft leasing business
     provided that the minimum amount of such insurances shall not be less than
     five hundred million Dollars ($500,000,000).

12.  TERMINATION

12.1 Grounds for Termination

     This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

     12.1.1 by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer; or

     12.1.2 by either Seller or Buyer, if the Closing shall not have been
          consummated on or before the Backstop Date; or

     12.1.3 by either Seller or Buyer, if consummation of the transactions
          contemplated by this Agreement would violate any nonappealable, final
          order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority having
          competent jurisdiction and such violation would have a material
          adverse effect on Seller (or any of its Affiliates) or Buyer (or any
          of its Affiliates)(as applicable);

     12.1.4 by Seller, if the Closing does not take place on November 30, 2006
          (or such later date contemplated by this Agreement) solely on account
          of (a) a Financing Brach or (b) a wilful failure by Buyer to fulfil a
          condition to the performance of the obligations of Seller set forth in
          this Agreement; or

     12.1.5 by Buyer, if the Closing does not take place on November 30, 2006
          (or such later date contemplated by this Agreement) solely on account
          of a wilful failure by Seller to fulfil a condition to the performance
          of the obligations of Buyer set forth in this Agreement.

     The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Clauses 12.1.2,
     12.1.3 or 12.1.4 shall give notice of that termination to the other party;
     provided that, if the failure to satisfy any condition to closing set forth
     in Clause 10 should result from (a) the wilful failure of any party to
     fulfil a condition to the performance of the obligations of that party to
     consummate the Closing, or (b) a wilful failure to perform a covenant of
     this Agreement or breach by any party hereto of any representation,
     warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, such party shall not be
     permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Clause 12.1.2.

12.2 Effect of Termination

     If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Clause 12.1 or Clause 13.9,
     that termination shall be without liability of either party (or any
     stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
     representative of that party) to the other party to this Agreement;
     provided that if that termination shall result from the wilful (a) failure
     of either party to fulfil a condition to the performance of the obligations
     of the other party, (b) failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or
     (c) breach by either party to this Agreement of any representation or
     warranty or agreement contained in this Agreement, that party shall be
     fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other
     party as a result of that failure or breach. Without limiting the
     foregoing, in the event of (i) a Financing Breach by Buyer or (ii) a
     willful breach by Buyer that results in a termination of this Agreement as
     contemplated by the proviso in the previous sentence, as liquidated
     damages, and not as a penalty, Seller shall, without any further action of


                                      -81-

<PAGE>

     any party, be entitled to $50,000,000 of the equity commitment contemplated
     by the Equity Commitment Letters, which amount is (or within three (3)
     Business Days after the date hereof, will be), either deposited in cash or
     available for drawing under the letters of credit provided to Buyer as
     contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters (it being understood that in
     the case of a Financing Breach that is not the result of or related to a
     wilful breach of this Agreement by Buyer, the foregoing amount of
     liquidated damages shall be Seller's sole and exclusive remedy in relation
     to such Financing Breach). The provisions of (a) the second sentence of
     Clause 5.2.1, (b) Clause 7.3, (c) this Clause 12.2, and (d) Clause 13 shall
     survive any termination of this Agreement.

     an Affiliate prior to the Closing or for the purpose of securing any
     financing of the transactions contemplated hereby, but no such assignment
     shall affect any obligations of Buyer under this Agreement.

13.4 Governing Law

     This Agreement shall be governed exclusively by and construed exclusively
     in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

13.5 Jurisdiction

     13.5.1 Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
          personal jurisdiction in the State of New York and voluntarily submits
          to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York located in
          the City of New York in any action or proceeding with respect to this
          Agreement, including the federal district courts located in the City
          of New York, for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or
          relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
          (and each party agrees not to commence any actions, suit or proceeding
          relating thereto except in such courts). Each party acknowledges that
          (a) state and federal courts of New York are courts of competent
          jurisdiction and (b) any judgments rendered by such courts are fully
          enforceable in Ireland in accordance with their terms. Each party
          hereby waives any and all defenses based upon Irish conflict of law
          principles, public policy or natural or substantial justice.

     13.5.2 Process in any suit, action or proceeding described in the preceding
          paragraph may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
          within or without the jurisdiction of any court identified in the

          that service of process on such party as


                                      -83-

<PAGE>

          provided in Clause 13.5.1 shall be deemed effective service of process
          on such party. In addition, Buyer hereby irrevocably appoints
          Macquarie Securities (USA) Inc. with offices at 125 West 55th Street,
          New York City, New York 10019 as its agent for service of process in
          any suit, action or proceeding described in the preceding paragraph
          and agrees that service of process in any such suit, action or
          proceeding may be made upon it at the office of such agent. Buyer
          waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any other requirements
          of or objections to personal jurisdiction with respect thereto. Buyer
          represents and warrants that such agent has agreed to act as Buyer's
          agent for service of process, and Buyer agrees to take any and all
          action, including the filing of any and all documents and instruments,
          that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and
          effect.

13.6 Counterparts; Effectiveness; No Third-Party Beneficiaries

     This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (including via
     fax or .pdf), each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as
     if the signatures to those pages were upon the same instrument. This
     Agreement shall become effective when each party to this Agreement shall
     have received a counterpart of this Agreement signed by the other party to
     this Agreement. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart of
     this Agreement signed by the other party to this Agreement, this Agreement
     shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation under
     this Agreement (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or
     other communication). No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer
     any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under this
     Agreement upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and
     their respective successors and assigns.

13.7 Entire Agreement

     This Agreement, the Schedules, Seller's Closing Documents, Other Selling
     Parties' Closing Documents, Buyer's Closing Documents, Exhibits, the
     Confidentiality Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement constitute
     the entire agreement between the parties with respect to their subject
     matter, and those agreements supersede all prior agreements and
     understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
     their subject matter.

13.8 Severability

     If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held
     by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be
     invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
     covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
     effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as
     the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
     Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
     modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
     closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
     the fullest extent possible.

13.9 Revised Schedules

     Seller may revise any of the Schedules to reflect any event that is not
     expressly prohibited by this Agreement and that occurs after the date of
     this Agreement by delivering a revised relevant Schedule to Buyer at any
     time and from time to time prior to the Closing Date (or, if applicable,
     the Deferred Date). Buyer shall have the right to review each revised
     Schedule for a period of three (3) Business Days after its receipt. At any
     time within such three (3) Business Day time period, Buyer shall have the
     right to terminate this Agreement by delivery of a notice to Seller if the
     revised information does not relate to the Focused Air Arrangements, the
     Contemplated Arrangements or any Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entity
     or Excluded Partnership Asset Owning Entity and would reasonably be
     expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. This notice, if given,
     shall specify the information forming the basis for the decision to
     terminate. Seller shall have three (3) Business Days after receipt of such
     notice to review with Buyer the information forming the basis of the
     decision to terminate and to attempt to agree on corrective measures, if
     any. If the parties cannot agree on corrective measures with such three (3)
     Business Day period, then this Agreement shall terminate. After the Closing
     Date, Seller may continue to revise the Schedules as contemplated by this
     Clause 13.9 with respect to the Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entities,
     but Buyer's rights with respect to such revised Schedules (which shall be
     exercised in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Clause 13.9)
     shall be limited only to excluding any Deferred Partnership Asset Owning
     Entity from the transactions contemplated hereby if any such revised
     Schedules reveal a breach of the first sentence of Clause 3.5.1 with
     respect to such Deferred Partnership Asset Owning Entity. If this Agreement
     is not terminated as permitted by this Clause 13.9, Buyer shall be deemed
     to have accepted such revisions, and the relevant Schedule attached to this
     Agreement as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed to be superseded
     by the relevant revised Schedule.

13.10 Specific Performance

     The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
     of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
     their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
     that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
     prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
     and provisions of this Agreement.

13.11 Bulk Sales

     Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of the
     Applicable Laws of any jurisdiction relating to a bulk sale or transfer of
     assets that may be applicable to the transfer of the Transferred Specified
     Ownership Interests or the Additional Assets.

                  ATTACHMENT A TO THE WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT
                       GATX AIR WORKING CAPITAL PRACTICES

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

1.   Basis of Consolidation. The consolidated balance sheet includes the
     specific assets being offered for sale and the related liabilities.
     Investments in affiliated companies (discussed herein) are not
     consolidated. Intercompany balances are eliminated.

2.   Use of Estimates. The preparation of the balance sheet in conformity with
     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")
     necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
     affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
     balance sheet. Seller regularly evaluates estimates and judgments based on
     historical experience and other relevant facts and circumstances. Actual
     amounts when ultimately realized could differ from those estimates.

3.   Cash and Cash Equivalents. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of
     three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.
     Restricted cash is comprised of cash and cash equivalents which are
     restricted as to withdrawal and usage.

4.   Finance Leases. Finance leases are comprised of direct finance leases and
     leveraged leases. Investment in direct finance leases consists of lease
     receivables, plus the estimated residual value of the equipment at the
     lease termination dates, less unearned income. Lease receivables represent
     the total rent to be received over the term of the lease reduced by rent
     already collected. Initial unearned income is the amount by which the
     original sum of the lease receivable and the estimated residual value
     exceeds the original cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is
     amortized to lease income over the lease term in a manner that produces a
     constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease.

     Finance leases that are financed principally with nonrecourse borrowings at
     lease inception and that meet certain criteria are accounted for as
     leveraged leases. Leveraged lease receivables are stated net of the related
     nonrecourse debt. Initial unearned income represents the excess of
     anticipated cash flows (including estimated residual values, net of the
     related debt service) over the original investment in the lease.

5.   Operating Leases. Aircraft subject to an operating lease are stated at cost
     less accumulated depreciation plus the unamortized balance of initial
     direct costs. Aircraft are depreciated straight-line over their estimated
     useful life, generally 25 years, to an estimated salvage value, generally
     15% of original equipment cost. The appropriateness of depreciable lives
     and residual values are periodically reviewed based on physical and
     economic factors, as well as existing market conditions. Operating lease
     income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
     underlying leases.

6.   Progress Payments. Amounts deposited toward the construction of wholly
     owned aircraft and other equipment, including capitalized interest, are
     classified as progress payments. Once Seller takes possession of the
     completed asset, amounts recorded as progress payments are reclassified to
     operating lease assets. Progress payments made for


                                     -171-

<PAGE>

     aircraft owned by joint ventures in which Seller participates are
     classified as investments in affiliated companies. In certain instances
     when progress payments are immaterial they may be classified with operating
     lease assets.

7.   Investments in Joint Ventures. Seller has investments in 20 to 50 per cent.
     -owned companies and joint ventures and other investments (collectively
     "affiliates") in which Seller does not have effective or voting control.
     These affiliates are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in
     affiliated companies are initially recorded at cost, including goodwill at
     the acquisition date. In certain instances, Seller's cost basis may be
     different than its share of the affiliates' net assets. These differences
     are primarily attributable to deferred gains on sales of assets to
     affiliates, loans to affiliates, and impairment losses recognized at the
     investor level. Seller defers the portion of any gains that relate to its
     proportional interest in an affiliate and recognizes them ratably, using
     the straight line method, over the useful life of the underlying asset.
     Seller makes loans to some of its affiliates, which Seller treats as equity
     contributions. Income on these loans offsets the proportional share of the
     affiliates' interest expense. Seller accounts for differences created by
     impairment losses recognized at the investor level as a basis difference so
     that Seller's share of future operating results from the affiliates will be
     reflective of the impairment charge taken. Pre-tax operating results from
     affiliates and impairment losses recognized at the investor level are
     reflected as share of affiliates' earnings (losses) in the statement of
     operations. The carrying amount of Seller's investments in affiliated
     companies is affected by Seller's share of the affiliates' undistributed
     earnings and losses, distributions of dividends, principal and loan
     payments from the affiliate, and impairment losses recognized at the
     investor level.

8.   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. A review for impairment of long-lived
     assets is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
     that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
     Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of
     the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be
     generated by the asset. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the
     impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount
     of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported
     at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

9.   Impairment of investments in affiliated companies. In accordance with
     Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 18, The Equity Method of
     Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, Seller reviews the carrying
     amount of its investments in affiliates annually, or whenever events or
     changes in circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have
     occurred.

     If management determines that indicators of impairment are present, an
     analysis is performed to estimate the fair value of the investment.
     Management defines fair value, for purposes of this policy, as the price
     that would be received for an investment in a current transaction between a
     willing buyer and seller. While quoted prices in active markets provide the
     best evidence of fair value, an active market does not exist for the
     majority of our joint venture investments. Thus an estimate of their fair
     value must be made. Some examples of acceptable valuation techniques that
     Seller may use to estimate


                                     -172-

<PAGE>

     fair value are discounted cash flows at the investee level, capitalized
     earnings or the present value of expected distributable cash from the
     investee. Additionally, price/earnings ratios based on comparable
     businesses may also be acceptable in certain circumstances. Other valuation
     techniques that are appropriate for the particular circumstances of a joint
     venture and for which sufficient data are available may also be used.

     Once an estimate of fair value is obtained it is compared to the
     investment's carrying value. If the investment's estimated fair value is
     less than its carrying value, then the investment is impaired. If an
     investment is impaired, then a determination is made as to whether the
     impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors that management considers in
     making this determination include: expected operating results for the near
     future, the length of the economic life cycle of the underlying assets of
     the business and the ability of the company to hold the investment through
     the end of the underlying assets' useful life. Anticipated management
     actions that are probable of being taken that may improve the business
     prospects of the investee are also considered.

     If management reasonably determines an investment to be temporarily
     impaired, no impairment loss would be recorded. Alternatively, if
     management determines that an investment is impaired on an
     other-than-temporary basis, a loss equal to the difference between the fair
     value of the investment and its carrying value is recorded in the period of
     identification.

10.  Aircraft Maintenance Reserves. Aircraft are typically subject to net leases
     under which the lessee is responsible for maintenance, insurance and taxes.
     Under the provisions of many of these leases, deposits are collected from
     lessees for future maintenance of the aircraft for which reserves are
     established. The reserves are attributable to specific aircraft and are
     classified as other liabilities. Upon occurrence of qualified maintenance
     events, which may range from routine maintenance to major airframe and
     engine overhauls, funds are disbursed and the reserve is relieved.
     Additionally, reserve amounts are reversed upon the sale of a related
     aircraft and included as a component of the disposition gain or loss.

11.  Lease Origination Costs. Initial direct costs of leases are deferred and
     amortized over the lease term, either as an adjustment to the yield for
     direct finance and leveraged leases (collectively, finance leases), or on a
     straight-line basis for operating leases.
