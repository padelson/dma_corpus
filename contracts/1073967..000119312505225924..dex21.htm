Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second
Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and
other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the
Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 3330 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California

California are permitted or required by law, executive order or governmental
decree to remain closed.



1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Buyer shall be merged
with and into the Company, at which time the separate corporate existence of
the Buyer shall cease and the Company shall continue its existence as the
surviving corporation. In its capacity as the corporation surviving the
Merger, the Company is sometimes referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Corporation_." From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.



1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The Certificate of Merger shall provide
that, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be amended in its entirety as of the Effective Time to read as set
forth in an exhibit to the Certificate of Merger, which exhibit shall read as
set forth on  _Exhibit C_ hereto until thereafter amended in accordance with
the provisions thereof and as provided by applicable law.



1.5 _By-laws_. At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Buyer, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by applicable
law, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such
by-laws.



1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.



 

(a) The directors of the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.



(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.



ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES



2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Buyer:



(a) _Capital Stock of the Buyer_. (i) Each share of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Buyer issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and (ii) each share of Series A Preferred Stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Buyer issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.



(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. Except as
provided below in Section 2.1(c), all shares of common stock, $0.001 par value
per share, of the Company (" _Company_  



 

2   _Common Stock_ ") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made or
consideration delivered in respect thereof.



(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b), (ii) shares of Company Common Stock owned by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include
the EBTs), which shall remain outstanding, and (iii) Dissenting Shares (as
defined in Section 2.4(a) below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be automatically converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive $24.00 in cash per share, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (each a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) upon the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.2.



(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common
Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.



2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging Certificates for
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows: 



(a) _Paying Agent_. On or prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, the
Buyer shall enter into an agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "), with a
nationally recognized bank or trust company mutually acceptable to the Buyer
and the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), which shall provide that at the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit, for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.1(b)), for payment through the Paying Agent in accordance with this Section
2.2, cash in an amount sufficient to make payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in exchange for all of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock other than the shares of Company
Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Paying Agent shall invest such cash as directed by the Surviving
Corporation on a daily basis and in accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement
(" _Permitted Investments_ "). Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation and any risk of
loss in connection with such investments shall be borne by the Surviving
Corporation. All costs and expenses related to the Paying Agent, the Paying
Agent Agreement and Permitted Investments shall be the responsibility of the
Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who
was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter
of transmittal, which shall be in customary form and specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so  



 

3  surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate
shall, subject to Section 2.4, be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to
this Section 2.2.



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Stock Transfer
Books_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby and from and after the Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as holders of Company Common Stock with respect to
such shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable
law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.



(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not
previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for, and
the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration without interest.



(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount of
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund deposited with the Paying Agent to pay for shares of Company
Common Stock that become Dissenting Shares shall be delivered to
the Surviving Corporation upon demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger
Consideration for such shares held by any stockholder who shall have failed to
perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such stockholders
rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.



(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options, as the case may be, such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation
to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.



(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement. 



2.3 _Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock_. 



(a) The Company shall take such action as shall be required to cause the
vesting of any unvested options to purchase Company Common Stock (" _Company
Stock Options_ ") granted under any stock option  



 

4  plans or other equity-related plans of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") to be accelerated in
full effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(b) Subject to Section 2.3(d) and Schedule 2.3(b), the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to effectuate the cancellation, as of the Effective Time,
of all Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time so that such Company Stock Options no longer represent the right to
purchase Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company, the
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any other person.



(c) Each holder of a Company Stock Option, subject to Section 2.3(d),
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall receive from
the Surviving Corporation, in respect and in consideration of each Company
Stock Option cancelled pursuant to 2.3(b), on the first Business
Day following the Effective Time, an amount (net of applicable taxes) equal
to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration per
share of Company Common Stock over (B) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable), without any interest
thereon (the " _Option Consideration_ ").



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall cooperate with the Buyer to allow certain Company Stock Options
designated by the Buyer with the agreement of the holders of such Company
Stock Options prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to remain
outstanding after the Effective Time.



(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action
under all stock purchase plans in place at the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to Company Common Stock (including, without limitation,
the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan) (collectively, " _Purchase Plans_ ") to
provide that (i) all participants rights under all current offering periods
shall terminate on November 30, 2005, and on such date all accumulated payroll
deductions allocated to each participants account under the Purchase Plans
shall thereupon be used to purchase from the Company whole shares of the
Companys Common Stock at a price determined under the terms of the Purchase
Plans for the offering period using the stock plan Termination Date as the
final purchase date and (ii) as of the close of business on the Business
Day immediately prior to the Effective Time, or if more administratively
advisable at the option of the Company, the last payroll date immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (the " _Stock Plan Termination Date_ ") the
Purchase Plans will terminate. At the Effective Time, any Company Common
Stock acquired under the Purchase Plans will be treated as provided in Section
2.1. The Company shall take all necessary action so that as of the date hereof
no new offering is made under the Purchase Plans.



(f) The Company shall take such action within its control as shall be
required to permit the restricted shares of Company Common Stock held by the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer as of the date hereof
of the Company to be exchanged (subject to the agreement of the holder
thereof) for shares of common stock of the Buyer immediately prior to the
Effective Time.



2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has properly demanded in
writing appraisal for such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
Section 262 (or any successor provision) of the DGCL (any such shares being
referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails
to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL
with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1,
but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a
holder of Dissenting Shares.



(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in
accordance with  



 

5  Section 2.1, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates
that formerly represented such shares, in accordance with Section 2.2. 



(c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any written withdrawal of any such demand and any other written
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment
or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its prior
written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital

a fully executed commitment letter (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), from
Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch Capital

facilities in the amount of $675 million in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the Contribution Agreement executed by
Silver Lake Partners II, L.P. and Silver Lake Technology Investors II, L.L.C.

such term is defined in the Contribution Agreement) have committed, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to provide equity
financing in the aggregate amount of up to $349 million (plus up to an

be duly paid in full when due. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Commitment Letters have not been amended or terminated. As of the date of this
Agreement, there is no existing default or breach on the part of Buyer, the
Silver Lake Investors or, to the Buyers knowledge, the Co-Investor or any
event which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Buyer or the Silver Lake Investors or, to the
Buyers knowledge, the Co-Investor under any of the Commitment Letters. As of
the date hereof, Buyer does not believe that it will be unable to satisfy in a
timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained
in the Commitment Letters. Assuming that the representations and warranties
of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct and based on the
financial projections provided by the Company to Buyer, the aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Commitment Letters, if and when funded immediately prior
to the Effective Time in accordance with the Commitment Letters, together with
the available unrestricted cash of the Company (assuming the liquidation of
all investments for their stated value), will be sufficient for Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, the aggregate
consideration to be paid to holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to  



 

24  Section 2.3 hereof, any repayment or conversions of the Convertible Notes
and the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Cash Merger Payments_
"). Buyer will not consummate the Merger unless immediately prior to the
Effective Time Buyer shall have received sufficient cash financing to enable
the Surviving Corporation to pay the Cash Merger Payments. The obligation of
the financing sources to fund the commitments under the Commitment Letters is
not subject to any conditions other than as set forth in the Commitment
Letters and, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, there are no
conditions to the obligation of the Senior Lenders to fund the commitments
thereunder set forth in the Fee Letter (as such term is defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter).



4.7 _Contribution Agreement_. As of the date hereof, the Buyer has delivered
to the Company a true and correct copy of the Contribution Agreement as in

modified in any material respect or in any respect that is adverse to the
Company without the prior written consent of the Special Committee.



4.8 _Brokers_. Except as provided in Section 8.3, if this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not be responsible
for any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission to any broker, finder
or investment banker in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer.



4.9 _Solvency; Surviving Corporation After the Merger_. Buyer is not entering
into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent
to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors. Assuming the
satisfaction of all of the conditions to Buyers obligations to consummate the
Merger and based on the financial projections provided by the Company to
Buyer, as of the Effective Time, and after giving effect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Surviving Corporation will be
Solvent. For the purposes of this Section 4.9, the term "Solvent" when used
with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (a)
the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as
of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal laws
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its
existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, (i) "not
have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay
its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature"
means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

the Closing Date (i) any Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for
any reason or (ii) any financing source that is a party to any Commitment
Letter notifies the Buyer that such source no longer intends to provide

consents or customary comfort letters with respect to the financial
statements as may be required to complete the transactions contemplated
hereby. Unless the Company otherwise agrees in a writing, any agreement,
certificate or document executed by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or representatives pursuant
to the foregoing shall in the event the financings contemplated by the
Commitment Letters have not occurred within five business days of the
execution thereof terminate and be of no force and effect as to such party ab
initio. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Company

similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the financings
contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the arrangements therefor prior to
the Effective Time.

_provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall provide the Buyer a reasonable
amount of time to comment on such supplemental indenture prior to its

treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to the
Company requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit
access to any such properties or information, (ii) in the reasonable judgment
of the Company, disclosure of any such information or document would result in
the loss of the Companys attorney-client privilege or (iii) in the reasonable
judgment of the Company, such disclosure would result in a material breach of
a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party on the
date of this Agreement. The Buyer and its officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, potential funding sources, placement agents,
financing representatives and other Representatives shall hold any such
information that is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the

provided to the Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the
Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement)

of the Company Meeting, _provided_ that no adjournment may be to a date on

date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees
and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or  



 

34  investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under the DGCL for officers and directors of Delaware
corporations. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled, subject to applicable
law, to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving Corporation
within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that
any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the
extent then required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.



(b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in
the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, modified
or repealed for a period of six years time from the Effective Time in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
at or prior to the Effective Time, were officers or directors of the Company,
unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable law
after the Effective Time. 



(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and the Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in
effect for six years from the Effective Time insurance "tail" or other
insurance policies with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the coverage
applicable to directors and officers as of the Effective Time under
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy; _provided_
, _however_ , that if such "tail" or other policies are not available at a
cost not greater than 200% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof
under such policy (the " _Insurance Cap_ ") (which premium the Company hereby
represents and warrants is as set forth on _Section 6.7(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule), then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
obtained as much comparable insurance as can reasonably be obtained in its
good faith judgment at a cost up to but not exceeding the Insurance Cap.



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and directors
of the Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall
operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.



(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries any of their officers, directors or employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.7 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.



(f) This Section 6.7 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
successors and assigns. In the event the Surviving Corporation or its
successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of the Surviving
Corporation shall honor the obligations set forth with respect to the
Surviving Corporation in this Section 6.7.



6.8 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) under such rule and result from the transactions contemplated
by Articles I and II of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company. 



 

35 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_.



(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer of any representation
or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or
inaccurate, or any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions
set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) would not be satisfied.



(b) The Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company of any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or
inaccurate, or any failure of the Buyer to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions
set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) would not be satisfied.



6.10 _Resignations; EBT s_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to the Buyer at the Closing evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer of the resignation, effective as of the Effective
Time, of all directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (except those
designated by the Buyer to the Company in writing at least 10 Business Days
prior to the Closing). The Company shall cooperate with the Buyer in seeking
to implement such arrangements with respect to the EBTs as shall be
reasonably requested by Buyer.



6.11 _Employee Benefits Matters_.



(a) The Buyer hereby agrees that, for a period of one year after the Effective
Time, it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries to, (i) provide employees of the Company as of the Effective
Time (each, an " _Employee_ "), with salary, employee benefits and incentive
compensation opportunities (other than equity-based compensation) that are
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to comply with the
terms of (including, without limitation, terms which provide for amendment
or termination) all Contracts of the Company (other than the Company Stock
Options cancelled pursuant to Section 2.3(a)) as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former employees
or directors of the Company. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee
of employment for any Employee, or to restrict the right of the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation to terminate any Employee or amend or terminate any
Company Plan.



(b) Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting, and benefit accrual, but excluding
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by the Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries under which
Employees may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time to the
same extent recognized by the Company under comparable Company Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding
of any such benefit. Such plan, program or arrangement shall credit Employees
for service accrued or deemed accrued on or prior to the Effective Time with
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.



(c) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation (" _Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which an active Employee
may become eligible to participate in the one-year period following
the Effective Time, the Buyer shall (i) waive, or use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to
preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to each active Employee under any Buyer
Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a comparable Company Plan
and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses
incurred by any Employee and his or her covered dependents under comparable
Company Plans during the plan year in which such individuals move to a
comparable Buyer Welfare Benefit Plan to be  



 

36  taken into account under the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her dependents as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans.



(d) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The Buyer and the Company acknowledge and
agree that all provisions contained in this Article VI with respect to
Employees are included for the sole benefit of the Buyer and the Company and
shall not create any right (i) in any other person, including, without
limitation, any Employees, any participant in any Company Plans or any
beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation or shall interfere with the right of Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any Buyer Welfare Benefit
Plan or Company Plan (subject in each case to the provisions of Section
6.11(a), (b) and (c) above) or to terminate the employment of any Employee for
any reason.

principal amount of any Convertible Notes that remain outstanding at Closing
to the extent that such outstanding Convertible Notes reduce the available

funding under the Contribution Agreement has not occurred and the only
condition to funding in the amounts required to satisfy the condition set

right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be

Agreement (or in the case of the Buyer, failure of SLP to fulfill any
obligation under the Commitment Letters) has been a principal cause of the
failure of the Merger to occur on or before the Outside Date; or



(c) by either the Buyer or the Company if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling
or taken any other nonappealable final action, in each case having the effect
of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger; or



(d) by either the Buyer or the Company if at the Company Meeting at which a
vote on the Company Voting Proposal is taken, the Required Company
Stockholder Vote in favor of the adoption of the Company Voting Proposal shall

from the Buyer or which by its nature or timing cannot reasonably be cured by

of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from the Company or

are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this

parent thereof and (y) the equity interests held in the Company and retained

all other classes of outstanding capital stock in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction or any direct or indirect parent thereof, (ii) a

by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company, but, after any such approval, no

stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.



8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,

any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a

waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in
any  



 

41  representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or
condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the
extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver

the address to which notices and other communications hereunder are to be
delivered by giving the other parties to this Agreement notice in the manner
herein set forth.



9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its
terms.



9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.7 (with
respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries),
this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to (a) confer any
rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, (b) create any agreement of
employment with any person or (c) otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto. 



9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer may
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of SLP without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _further_
, that no such assignment shall relieve the Buyer of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.



9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity, legality or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision,
to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal
or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid,
legal and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement
shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not
exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with
a valid, legal and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable term.



9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.



9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be  



 

43  deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the context requires otherwise. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." No summary of this
Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.



9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.



9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.



9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the
parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any
party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy
of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section
9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law.



9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE BUYER AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE BUYER OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
