Section 7.06. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 under any Debt Commitment Letter. None of Parent, Merger
Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 is, as of the date of this Agreement, aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions
or statements set forth in any Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate (assuming the accuracy of the Company&rsquo;s representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement) in any material respect, that would cause the commitments provided in the Debt Commitment
Letter to be terminated or ineffective or any of the conditions contained therein not to be met. The consummation of the Debt Financing
is subject to no conditions precedent other than those expressly set forth in the copies of the Debt Commitment Letters delivered
to the Company, and there are no contingencies that would permit the Financing Sources to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing
other than those expressly set forth in the copies of the Debt Commitment Letters delivered to the Company. Except for fee letters
relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing (redacted copies of which, removing only fee amounts, market &ldquo;flex&rdquo;
provisions and certain other terms (none of which concern or would adversely affect the amounts, availability, timing or conditionality
of the Debt Financing), have been provided to the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement), there are no side letters
