Optionholder Parent Warrants to purchase that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to such
Optionholder\'s pro rata share of 300,000 (based on the aggregate amount of
cash paid to all     10  16  holders of Company Common Stock,
Optionholders and Warrantholders pursuant to this ARTICLE II); provided that
each Optionholder who does not prior to surrender of his or her Company
Options for cancellation deliver to Parent an Investment Letter substantially

shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of each
Company Warrant held by such Warrantholder by (y) the difference of (A) the
Per Share Cash Merger Consideration less (B) $0.01; and   (ii) issue each
Warrantholder Parent Warrants to purchase that number of shares of Parent

and Warrantholders pursuant to this ARTICLE II); provided that Company

a commercial bank or trust company having net capital of not less than
$100 million jointly selected by Parent and the Company to act as Escrow
Agent hereunder (the "ESCROW AGENT") an amount equal to $17,500,000 for the
purpose of securing the indemnification obligations set forth in ARTICLE VIII

of the Total Cash Consideration and shall be held by the Escrow Agent under
an Escrow Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT 2.9
to be entered into among Parent, Genstar and the Escrow Agent (the "ESCROW
AGREEMENT") pursuant to the terms thereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a

or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held
and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. The Merger Consideration Spreadsheet shall set forth for

authorize a commercial bank or trust company having net capital of not less
than $100 million (or one or more other persons or entities as shall
be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) to act as paying
agent hereunder (the "PAYING AGENT") for the payment and issuance of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to SECTION 2.6(b) upon surrender of
Certificates and the payment of the consideration payable for Company
Warrants pursuant to SECTION 2.8(a) upon surrender of the Company Warrants.
All of the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent shall be borne by
Parent.   (b) PARENT TO PROVIDE FUNDS. Parent shall take all steps necessary
to deposit in trust with the Paying Agent prior to the Effective Time cash
and Parent Warrants in an amount necessary to pay for all shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to SECTION 2.6(b) (less any amounts deposited in the
Escrow Fund pursuant to SECTION 2.9) and the amount of cash and Parent
Warrants required to pay for all of the Company Warrants pursuant to SECTION
2.8(a) (less any amounts deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to SECTION
2.9). Such amount shall hereinafter be referred to as the "EXCHANGE
FUND."   The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent in direct obligations of the United
States, obligations for which the full faith     12  18  and credit of
the United States is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and
interest, commercial paper rated of the highest quality by Moody\'s Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Ratings Group or certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers\' acceptances of a
commercial bank having at least $100,000,000 in assets, in each case with
maturities not exceeding seven days (collectively "PERMITTED INVESTMENTS"),
or in money market funds which are invested in Permitted Investments, and any
net earnings with respect thereto shall be for the account of Parent. The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments
referred to in SECTIONS 2.6(b) and 2.8(a) out of the Exchange Fund at the
Effective Time or as promptly as is practicable thereafter (assuming all
documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent shall have been received).
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose except as otherwise
agreed to by Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to
the contrary, the Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
make the cash payments referred to in SECTIONS 2.6(b) and 2.8(a) by wire
transfer in immediately available funds if so requested by the holder of any
Certificate or Warrantholder, as applicable.   If the amount of cash in the
Exchange Fund is insufficient to pay all of the amounts required to be paid
pursuant to SECTIONS 2.6(b) and 2.8(a), Parent from time to time after the
Effective Time shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause the
Surviving Corporation to deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying
Agent sufficient to make all such payments.   (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. The
Company shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate, other than
Certificates to be canceled or retired pursuant to SECTION 2.6(a), (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the amount of cash into which
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to SECTION 2.6(b), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate. If payment is to be made to a person or entity other than the
person or entity in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person or
entity requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this SECTION 3.1(c), each Certificate (other
than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and Certificates
representing any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled or retired
pursuant to SECTION 2.6(a)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of
cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to SECTION 2.6(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to a
former stockholder of the     13  19  Company for any cash or interest
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be repaid to Parent (including, without limitation, all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all such
funds). Thereafter, persons or entities who prior to the Merger held shares
of Company Common Stock shall look only to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent (subject to the terms of this Agreement and abandoned property,
escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any Total Cash Consideration
that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them,
without interest.   (d) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate or Company
Warrant shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate or Company
Warrant to be lost, stolen or destroyed and (ii) the execution and delivery
to Parent of an indemnity agreement in customary form and substance, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate or Company Warrant the consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   SECTION 3.2 DISSENTING SHARES.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required
by the DGCL, but only to the extent required thereby, shares of Company
Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by holders of such shares of Company Common
Stock who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in
accordance with Delaware law (the "DISSENTING SHARES") will not be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders
of such shares of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive payment of
the appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions of Delaware law unless and until such holders fail to perfect
or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under
the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Common
Stock will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to
have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give
Parent and Merger Sub (A) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other related instruments
received by the Company and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company will not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demand.   SECTION 3.3 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN SHARES OF COMPANY
COMMON STOCK; CLOSING OF COMPANY TRANSFER BOOKS. At and after the Effective
Time, each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any rights as a
stockholder of the Company, except for, in the case of a holder of a
Certificate (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to SECTION 2.6(a) and
other than Dissenting Shares), the right to surrender his or her Certificate
in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration or, in the case of a
holder of Dissenting Shares, to perfect his or her right to receive payment
for his or her shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Delaware law and no
transfer of shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter     14  20  be made. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided for herein.   SECTION 3.4
WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock,
any Optionholder and any Warrantholder such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and any provision of state, local or foreign tax law (including
without limitation, under Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code, if
applicable). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock, the Optionholder or the Warrantholder
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   SECTION 3.5 FURTHER
ASSURANCES. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger.   ARTICLE IV.

Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder, and the consummation by each of
Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly

under the Parent Warrants, and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby and the consummation by Parent of

Order or Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or the assets or properties
of Parent or Merger Sub, or (iii) result in a material breach of, or
constitute a material default (or event which with the giving of notice or
lapse of time, or both, would become a material default) under, or give rise
to any rights of termination, amendment, modification, acceleration or
cancellation of or loss of any benefit under, or result in the creation of
any Encumbrance on any of the assets or properties of Parent or Merger Sub

which any of the assets or properties of Parent or Merger Sub is bound
or affected, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this SECTION

under the Parent Warrant and consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby.   SECTION 5.4 CONSENTS, APPROVALS, ETC. No consent, waiver,

such filing or notification would not, when taken together with all
other such failure by Parent and Merger Sub, have a material adverse effect
on the ability of either Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or
of Parent to perform its obligations under the Parent Warrants and consummate
the transactions contemplated thereby.   SECTION 5.5 LITIGATION AND
GOVERNMENTAL ORDERS. As of the date hereof, (i) there are no material Actions
pending against Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiaries of Parent ("PARENT
SUBSIDIARIES"), or any of the assets or properties of Parent, Merger Sub or
any Parent Subsidiaries, that, if decided adversely to Parent, Merger Sub or

arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates.   SECTION 5.8 NO PRIOR ACTIVITIES. Merger Sub has not incurred

other action on the part of Parent is necessary to authorize the execution

the Parent Warrants have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance, and,

agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement.   (c) PROCEDURE
FOR CLAIMS BETWEEN PARTIES.   (i) If a claim for Losses is to be made by a
party entitled to indemnification hereunder, the party claiming such
indemnification shall give written notice to the indemnifying party as soon
as practicable after the indemnified Person becomes aware of any fact,
condition or event which may give rise to Losses for which indemnification
may be sought under this SECTION 8.2. Any failure to submit any such notice
of claim to the indemnifying Person(s) shall not relieve such Person(s) of
any liability hereunder, except to the extent such Person(s) is actually
prejudiced by such failure. The indemnifying Person(s) shall be deemed to
have accepted the notice of claim and to have agreed to pay the Losses at
issue if such Person(s) does not send a notice of disagreement to the
indemnified Person within 20 calendar days after receiving the notice of
claim. In the case of a disputed claim, the parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to resolve the matter internally on an expeditious basis and in any
event within 45 calendar days after the notice is received by
the indemnifying Person(s).   (ii) Genstar shall act as the representative
of the Shareholders, the Optionholders and the Warrantholders (the
"INDEMNIFICATION REPRESENTATIVE") to take any and all action on their behalf
in respect of the indemnification provisions contained in this Agreement and
Parent is authorized to rely on any such action as being the duly authorized
action of the Shareholders, the Optionholders and the Warrantholders. The
Indemnification Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Shareholders, the Optionholders and the Warrantholders from and against any
Actions brought against the Indemnification Representative in connection with
the performance of its duties under this Agreement.   (d) DEFENSE OF THIRD
PARTY CLAIMS. If any lawsuit or enforcement action is filed against any
indemnified Person, written notice thereof shall be given to the indemnifying
Person(s) as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 15 calendar
days after the service     44  50  of the citation or summons). The
failure of any indemnified Person to give timely notice hereunder shall not
affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the
indemnifying Person(s) were actually prejudiced by such failure. After such
notice, provided that the indemnifying Person(s) acknowledge in writing to
the indemnified Person that the indemnifying Person(s) shall be obligated
under the terms of its indemnity hereunder in connection with such lawsuit or
action, then the indemnifying Person(s) shall be entitled, if its so elects,
by written notice to the indemnified Person(s) given within 15 calendar days
after the date of the notice of the claim from the indemnified Person
pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph (d), at its own cost, risk
and expense, (i) to take control of the defense and investigation of
such lawsuit or action (except with respect to any claims for equitable
relief, provided that the indemnified Person shall consult with the
indemnifying Person in connection with any such proceeding), (ii) to employ
and engage attorneys of their own choice to handle and defend the same,
unless the indemnified Person reasonably concludes that counsel for the
indemnifying Person(s) has a conflict of interest or the indemnified Person
has been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses
available to such indemnified Person that are different from or additional to
those available to the indemnifying Person(s), in which event the indemnified
Person shall be entitled, at the indemnifying Person(s)\'s cost, risk and
expense, to separate counsel of its own choosing, and (iii) to compromise or
settle such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the
written consent of the indemnified Person, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld (it being agreed that it shall be reasonable
to withhold such consent if such compromise or settlement does not include
a complete release of the indemnified Person from all liability with
respect thereto, or imposes any liability on the indemnified Person). The
indemnified Person shall cooperate at the expense of the indemnifying Person
in all reasonable respects with the indemnifying Person(s) and its attorneys
in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action and any
appeal arising therefrom; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the indemnified Person may,
at its own cost, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such
lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom. The parties shall
cooperate with each other in any notifications to insurers. If the
indemnifying Person fails to assume the defense of such claim within 15
calendar days after the notice of claim, the indemnified Person against which
such claim has been asserted will (upon delivering notice to such effect to
the indemnifying Person) have the right to undertake, at the indemnifying
Person\'s cost, risk and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement of
such claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the indemnifying
Person. If the indemnified Person assumes the defense of the claim, the
indemnified Person will keep the indemnifying Person reasonably informed of
the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement. The indemnifying
Person shall be liable for any settlement of any action effected pursuant to
and in accordance with this SECTION 8.2 and for any final judgment (subject
to any right of appeal), and the indemnifying Persons agree to indemnify and
hold harmless an indemnified Person from and against any Losses by reason of
such settlement or judgment.   (e) LIMITATIONS.   (i) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, none of the Shareholders, the
Optionholders or the Warrantholders, on the one hand, nor Parent, on the
other, shall be entitled to recover, and the other party or parties, as the
case may be, shall not be obligated to pay, any claim for indemnification
under Section 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i), as applicable, unless and until the
aggregate dollar amount of all indemnification claims against such party
or     45  51  parties hereunder exceeds $2,000,000, in which event the
party or parties entitled to such indemnification shall be entitled to
recover only the amount of their indemnification claims in excess of
$1,000,000. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no claim for
indemnification under SECTION 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i), as applicable, may be
asserted by an indemnified party unless such claim, together with all related
claims, equals or exceeds $30,000. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, the aggregate indemnification obligation of the
Shareholders, the Optionholders and the Warrantholders hereunder for all
Losses (other than pursuant to SECTION 8.2(a)(iii)) shall not exceed the
Escrow Amount and the sole source of funds for such indemnification (other
than pursuant to SECTION 8.2(a)(iii)) shall be the Escrow Fund.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the aggregate
indemnification obligation of Parent hereunder for all Losses shall not
exceed $17,500,000.   (ii) For purposes of SECTION 8.2(a)(i) and SECTION
8.2(b)(i)), "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" (as such terms is used in
any representation or warranty contained in ARTICLE IV or ARTICLE V) shall be
deemed to mean a Loss (with respect to any such representation or warranty)
which exceeds $250,000; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
the representation contained in SECTION 4.8.   (f) ENFORCEMENT OF OTHER
RIGHTS.   (i) In the event that the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall have the right to seek indemnification under any of the Prior
Agreements for Losses that are otherwise subject to an indemnification claim
under SECTION 8.2, an indemnified party shall have the right to assert a
claim for indemnification, but not have a right to indemnification under this
ARTICLE VIII for Losses unless the Company or the appropriate Company
Subsidiary first asserts and prosecutes in a commercially reasonable manner,
in a timely manner and consistent with applicable agreements, a claim to
recover any Losses from third parties under the Prior Agreements (the "OTHER
INDEMNIFYING PARTIES"). Provided that the indemnified Person has used such
commercially reasonable efforts, then to the extent that the indemnified
Person shall not have recovered from the Other Indemnifying Parties within 12
months after a claim for indemnification is made pursuant to this ARTICLE
VIII (or, if longer, prior to the 18 month anniversary of the Closing), then
this SECTION 8.2(f) shall not limit the indemnified Person\'s right to
indemnification for Losses under this ARTICLE VIII. Nothing in this SECTION
8.2(f) shall limit an indemnifying Person\'s rights under SECTION 8.2(h). Any
and all costs incurred by the indemnified Persons in pursuing a claim against
the Other Indemnifying Parties shall be Losses and be subject to
indemnification hereunder.   (ii) Parent will cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (a) not to amend or modify in any material respect any
contractual rights of indemnification, reimbursement or contribution existing
in favor of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
under the Prior Agreements, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnification Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, and (b) to comply in all material respects with the Prior
Agreements.   (g) EARN-OUT MATTERS.    46  52   Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, the indemnification obligations
under SECTION 8.2(a)(III) related to the earn-out under the DuPont Agreement
shall be subject to the following:   (i) From the Closing through 2001, the
Company shall, for purposes of the gross margin calculation under the DuPont
Agreement, (A) continue to use the accounting methods that the Company
currently uses with respect to the calculation and allocation of costs
(including overhead); (B) in the event that the Company eliminates any
function, the cost of which has historically been allocated for purposes of
determining the gross margin, make an appropriate allocation of cost to be
included in the determining the gross margin; and (C) follow the current
practice in determining products that are included and excluded in the gross
margin calculation under the DuPont Agreement consistent with the methods
used in preparing the Margin Statements (as defined in the DuPont Agreement)
for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall (1) maintain the information necessary to perform the calculation, and
(2) give the Indemnification Representative and its representatives
reasonable access to the books and records of the Company and any Company
Subsidiary sufficient to enable the Indemnification Representative to prepare
the Margin Statement. Parent, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
cause the Company\'s independent certified public accountants to cooperate
with the Indemnification Representative and to submit the Margin Statement
pursuant to the DuPont Agreement in accordance with the
reasonable instructions of the Indemnification Representative. The
Indemnification Representative shall have the sole right to submit the Margin
Statement and shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations
with DuPont relating to the earn-out. Parent shall notify the Indemnification
Representative within 45 days prior to the time that the Company or any
Company Subsidiary makes any payment to DuPont that would give rise to such
an indemnification claim under SECTION 8.2(a)(iii).   (ii) Parent will
cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (a) not to amend or modify the
DuPont Agreement with respect to the earn-out and the gross margin
calculation, without the prior written consent of the Indemnification
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (b)
to comply in all material respects with any and all such agreements,
arrangements and understandings.   (h) SUBROGATION. Upon making any payment
to an indemnified party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this
ARTICLE VIII, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of
such payment, to any rights that the indemnified party may have against any
other persons with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim and the indemnified party shall take such actions as
the indemnifying party may reasonably require to perfect such subrogation or
to pursue such rights against such other persons as the indemnified party may
have; provided that no such right of subrogation shall exist unless and until
the indemnified party\'s Losses with respect to the subject matter underlying
such indemnified claim are paid in full if the amount of the indemnification
payment is not sufficient to pay such Losses in full.   (i) INSURANCE;
REIMBURSEMENTS; TAXES. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is
provided under this ARTICLE VIII shall be reduced by (i) any related
recoveries actually received by the indemnified party under insurance
policies or other related payments     47  53  received from third
parties, and (ii) any Tax benefits actually received by the indemnified party
or any of its Affiliates on account of the matter resulting in such Losses or
the payment of such Losses. In the event that the indemnified party receives
any such recoveries or Tax benefits on account of Losses that have previously
been paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party, the indemnified
party shall, after receipt thereof, promptly pay over to the indemnifying
party the full amount of such recoveries or Tax benefits received. If an
indemnified party receives payment from a third party in respect of
Losses for which an indemnifying party has provided indemnification, then
the indemnified party shall reimburse the indemnifying party to the extent of
such payment (up to the amount of the indemnification provided by the
indemnifying party).   (j) No Shareholder, Optionholder or Warrantholder
shall have any right to, or shall, seek contribution with respect to, or
other reimbursement for, his, her or its indemnification obligations set
forth in this ARTICLE VIII from the Surviving Corporation or the Company.

PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or stock
exchange rules and regulations, no party to this Agreement shall make any
public     50  56  announcements in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or otherwise communicate with any news
media regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. If a public
statement is required to be made pursuant to applicable Law or stock exchange
rules and regulations, the parties shall consult with each other, to the
extent reasonably practicable, in advance as to the contents and timing
thereof.   SECTION 10.5 INTERPRETATION. The Article and Section headings in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed
to alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision hereof.
References to Articles or Sections in this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated, are references to Articles or Sections of this Agreement. The
parties to this Agreement have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises with respect to any term or provision of this
Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the authorship of any of the terms
or provisions hereof. Any reference to any federal, state, county, local or
foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
For all purposes of and under this Agreement, (i) the word "including" shall
be deemed to be immediately followed by the words "without limitation," (ii)
words (including defined terms) in the singular shall be deemed to include
the plural and vice versa, (iii) words of one gender shall be deemed to
include the other gender as the context requires, and (iv) the terms
"hereof," "herein," "hereto," "herewith" and any other words of similar
import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to
this Agreement as a whole (including all of the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto) and not to any particular term or provision of this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified.   SECTION 10.6 SEVERABILITY. In the event that any one
or more of the terms or provisions contained in this Agreement or in any
other certificate, instrument or other document referred to herein, shall,
for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other term or provision of this Agreement or any other such certificate,
instrument or other document referred to herein, and the parties hereto shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute one or more valid,
legal and enforceable terms or provisions into this Agreement which, insofar
as practicable, implement the purposes and intent hereof. Any term or
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part,
degree or within certain jurisdictions will remain in full force and effect
to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable to the extent consistent with
the intent of the parties as reflected by this Agreement. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, each party waives any term or provision of Law
which renders any term or provision of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect.   SECTION 10.7 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This
Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and the Exhibits hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.     51 
57   SECTION 10.8 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto, and any purported assignment or
other transfer without such consent shall be void and unenforceable. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.   SECTION 10.9 NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except
as specifically provided in SECTION 6.7 (and solely with respect to parties
indemnified thereunder), this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.  
SECTION 10.10 WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS. This Agreement may be amended
or modified only by a written instrument executed by all of the parties
hereto. Any failure of the parties hereto to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver. No delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any waiver on the part of any party hereto of any right, power or
privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. Unless
otherwise provided, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the parties hereto may
otherwise have at law or in equity. Whenever this Agreement requires or
permits consent by or on behalf of a party, such consent shall be given in
writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of
compliance as set forth in this SECTION 10.10.   SECTION 10.11 EQUITABLE
REMEDIES. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the other
parties hereto would be irreparably damaged in the event that any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto hereby agrees that the other parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance
by such first party under this Agreement, and each party hereto hereby agrees
to waive the defense in any such suit that the other parties hereto have
an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise,
as to the propriety of injunction or specific performance as a remedy, and
hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in connection with
obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies described in this SECTION 10.11
shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in
equity that the parties hereto may elect to pursue. The parties hereto hereby
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the terms or
provision of this Agreement required to be performed prior to the Effective
Time are not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that, prior to
the Effective Time, the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or in
equity.     52  58   SECTION 10.12 GOVERNING LAW; CONSENT TO
JURISDICTION. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed entirely within such State. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
its assets and properties, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware
State court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting within
the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the agreements delivered in connection herewith, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware State court
or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court, and (iv) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by law. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in SECTION 10.3. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law.   SECTION 10.13
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES

IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 10.13.   SECTION 10.14 EXCLUSIVITY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES. It is the explicit intent and understanding of each of the

whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, other than those set forth
in this Agreement (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule and the

relying on any statement, representation or warranty, oral or written,
express or implied, made by     53  59  another party hereto or such
other party\'s Affiliates, representatives or agents, except for the
