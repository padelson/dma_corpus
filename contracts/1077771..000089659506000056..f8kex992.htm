terms and conditions set forth in the Holding Company Plan of Merger. The

shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon to effect
the Holding Company Merger and the Secretary of State of the State of
California as required under California law.

outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Merger shall remain
outstanding and shall be deemed to be one share of the capital stock of the
surviving corporation.

 

  2.1.4 All shares of WSB Common Stock that are "dissenting shares"
within the meaning of CGCL § 1300 ("Dissenters\' Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive Umpqua Common Stock unless and
until such shares have lost their status as dissenting shares under CGCL §
1300, at which time such shares shall be converted into Umpqua Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1.5.

 

  2.1.5 As of the Effective Time, each outstanding share of WSB Common
Stock (other than Dissenters\' Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive the number of shares of Umpqua Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio and the right to receive cash in lieu of any resulting fractional shares
and any dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 2.3.3. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Umpqua Common

each outstanding option to acquire WSB Common Stock (each a "WSB Option")
shall be automatically converted into an option to purchase Umpqua Common
Stock (each, a "Converted Option") as follows: (i) the number of shares of
Umpqua Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Converted Option shall be
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of WSB Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of the WSB Option, and (B) the Exchange Ratio; and (ii) the
exercise price per share of Umpqua Common Stock shall be equal to the
quotient of (A) the exercise price of the WSB Option, divided by (B) the
Exchange Ratio. Other than with respect to any WSB Options contractually
required to become fully vested upon a change of control of WSB, all other
terms and conditions of the Converted Options shall remain the same as the
terms and conditions of the WSB Options. With respect to any WSB Option that
is an incentive stock option within

   the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, the foregoing adjustments shall be

  (b) Umpqua shall, as of the Effective Time, assume the obligations of
WSB under all plans and agreements pursuant to which a WSB Option has been
issued (the "WSB Stock Plans") and shall take all corporate action necessary
to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Umpqua Common Stock
for delivery upon exercise of the Converted Options. Umpqua shall cause the
registration of the shares of Umpqua Common Stock subject to the Converted

Umpqua Common Stock subject to the Converted Options promptly after the
Effective Time; and, thereafter, Umpqua shall deliver to holders of Converted

Plans of Merger shall be filed with the Oregon Director for purposes of
obtaining a Certificate of Merger.

 

  2.2.2 As of the date set forth in the Certificate of Merger, each of
the WSB Banks will merge with Umpqua Bank, with Umpqua Bank being the
resulting bank and having its head office in Roseburg, Oregon.

 

  2.2.3 Umpqua Bank\'s Articles of Incorporation and Umpqua Bank\'s
Bylaws and the banking charter of Umpqua Bank in effect immediately before
the date set forth on the Certificate of Merger shall be the articles of
incorporation, bylaws and banking charter of the resulting bank.

 

 Upon effectiveness of the Bank Mergers, each outstanding share of Umpqua
Bank common stock shall remain outstanding as shares of the resulting bank,
the holders of such shares shall retain their rights with respect to
such shares as in effect prior to the Bank Merger, and each outstanding share
of each of the WSB Banks held by WSB will be cancelled.

   \t 2.3 \t \t|   _Exchange Procedures._ \t  
---|--- 
  

  2.3.1 Prior to the Effective Date, Umpqua shall appoint an exchange
agent reasonably acceptable to WSB for the purpose of exchanging certificates
representing shares of WSB Common Stock (other than Dissenters\' Shares) for
Umpqua Common Stock as required by Section 2.1 (the "Exchange Agent"). On or
about the Effective Date, Umpqua will issue and deliver to the Exchange Agent
certificates representing a sufficient number of shares of Umpqua Common Stock
issuable in the Holding Company Merger and an estimate of the cash required to
make cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and, after the Effective Time,
if applicable, any cash and dividends or other distributions of Umpqua Common
Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to Section 2.3.3.

 

  2.3.2 Promptly after the Effective Time, Umpqua shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares (other than holders
of Dissenters\' Shares) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of
the Holding Company Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
certificates for shares of WSB Common Stock ("Old Certificates") shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof, as provided in Section 2.3.5) and instructions for surrendering the
Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange
Agent. Upon surrender for cancellation to the Exchange Agent of one or more
Old Certificates, accompanied by a duly executed letter of transmittal in
proper

   form, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to each holder of such surrendered
Old Certificates new certificates representing the appropriate number of
shares of Umpqua Common Stock ("New Certificates"), together with checks
for payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares to be issued in respect of
the Old Certificates plus any dividends or other distributions that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2,
less any taxes required to be withheld with respect thereto.

 

  2.3.3 Until Old Certificates have been surrendered and exchanged for
New Certificates as herein provided, each outstanding Old Certificate shall
be deemed, for all corporate purposes of Umpqua, to represent the number of
shares of Umpqua Common Stock into which the shares of WSB Common Stock were
exchanged pursuant to Section 2.1.5. All shares of Umpqua Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to the Holding Company Merger shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Umpqua in respect of the Umpqua Common Stock, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions which
are declared on Umpqua Common Stock into which shares of WSB Common Stock
have been converted after the Effective Date will be paid to persons otherwise
entitled to receive the same until the Old Certificates have been surrendered
in exchange for New Certificates in the manner herein provided. In no event
shall the persons entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions be
entitled to receive interest on such dividends or other distributions. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of WSB Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the WSB, a New Certificate, together
with a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Old Certificate
and any other dividends or distributions in respect thereof, may be
issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Old Certificate formerly
representing such shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required by Umpqua and the Exchange Agent to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

 

  2.3.4 Any Umpqua Common Stock or cash delivered to the Exchange Agent
(together with any interest or dividends thereon) and not issued pursuant to
this Section 2.3 at the end of twelve months from the Effective Date shall be
returned to Umpqua, in which event the persons entitled thereto shall look
only to Umpqua for payment thereof.

 

  2.3.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, if any holder of WSB Common Stock shall be unable to surrender his
or her Old Certificates because such certificates have been lost or destroyed,
such holder may deliver in lieu thereof a lost stock certificate affidavit
and, unless waived, at the sole option of Umpqua or the Exchange Agent, an
indemnity bond in customary amount together with a surety, each in a form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Umpqua or the Exchange Agent.

 

  2.3.6 The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any
rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Umpqua Common Stock or WSB
Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall
receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with
respect to such shares of Umpqua Common Stock for the account of the persons
entitled thereto.

 

  2.4 _Dissenters\' Shares_. Any Dissenting Shareholder who shall be
entitled to be paid the fair market value of such shareholder\'s shares of
WSB Common Stock, as provided in Section 1300 of the CGCL, shall not be
entitled to shares of Umpqua Common Stock at the Exchange Ratio in respect
thereof unless and until such Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Dissenting
Shareholder\'s right to dissent from the Holding Company Merger under the
CGCL, and shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided for
by Section 1300 of the CGCL with respect to such Dissenters\' Shares.

    2.5 _Anti-Dilution Provision_. If Umpqua changes or proposes to change
the number of shares of Umpqua Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding Umpqua Common Stock, or exchanges
Umpqua Common Stock for a different number or kind of shares or securities or
is involved in any transaction resulting in any of the foregoing, and the
record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Date, the Exchange Ratio
shall be proportionately adjusted. 

 

  2.6 _Reservation of Right to Revise Transaction_. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Umpqua shall have the unilateral
right to revise the method of effecting the Bank Mergers, to achieve tax
benefits or for any other reason in Umpqua\'s sole discretion, including,
without limitation, substituting for the Bank Mergers one or more transactions
resulting in a purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain
liabilities by Umpqua Bank from ACB, CCB, LCB or WSNB; provided, however, that
Umpqua shall not have the right, without the prior written approval of WSB,
and if required, the approval of the shareholders of WSB, to revise any aspect
of the Bank Mergers, which revision would (i) change the amount or nature of
the consideration which WSB shareholders are entitled to receive pursuant
hereto; (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of WSB\'s shareholders as a
result of receiving the consideration pursuant hereto; (iii) materially impede
or delay consummation of the Holding Company Merger or the Bank Mergers or
other transactions to be consummated pursuant to this Agreement; or (iv)
otherwise be materially prejudicial to the interests of the shareholders of
WSB.

   \t 3. \t \t|  Directors.\t

  \t|  3.1 _Election of Director._ Prior to the Effective Date, WSB shall
provide Umpqua with a list\t

perform their obligations under this Agreement, or to prevent the termination
of any material right, privilege, license or agreement of WSB or any of the
WSB Banks, or any material loss or disadvantage to their business, as a
result of consummation of the Holding Company Merger or Bank Mergers, except
for:

 

   (a) approval from, or waiver of jurisdiction by, the Oregon
Director, FDIC and California Commissioner of the Bank Mergers;

    (b) approval from, or waiver of jurisdiction by, the FRB of the
Holding Company Merger;

the Proxy Statement is a part, under the Securities Act.

 

  As of the date hereof, WSB has no Knowledge of any reason why the
approvals set forth in this Section 4.14 and in Section 8.4 will not be
received without the imposition of a condition, restriction or requirement of
the type described in Section 8.4.

 

  4.15 _Corporate and Shareholder Approval of Agreement, Binding

power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by the Board of
Directors of each of WSB and each of the WSB Banks. No other corporate action
on the part of WSB or any of the WSB Banks other than shareholder approval is
required to authorize this Agreement or the Holding Company Plan of Merger or
Bank Plans of Merger or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by WSB and each
of the WSB Banks, and assuming the accuracy of Umpqua\'s representations
and warranties, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each
of them enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors\'
rights and to general equity principles.

 

  4.16 _No Defaults from Transaction_. Subject to compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.14 and Section 4.21 of the WSB Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Holding Company Plan of Merger or Bank Plans of Merger by WSB and each
of the WSB Banks, as the case may be, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby will conflict with, result in any material breach or
violation of, or result in any default or any acceleration of performance
under, or will result in the declaration or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any of the assets of WSB or any of the WSB Banks under, any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of (a) WSB\'s Articles of
Incorporation, WSB\'s Bylaws, each of the WSB Banks\' respective Articles of
Incorporation or Articles of Association and each of the WSB Banks\'
respective Bylaws, (b) any statute, regulation or existing order, writ,
injunction or decree of any court or governmental agency, or (c) any contract,
agreement or instrument to which any of WSB or the WSB Banks is a party or by
which any of WSB or the WSB Banks is bound, except in the case of clauses (b)
and (c) as would not reasonasbly be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to WSB or to materially
hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

  4.17 _Tax Returns_. WSB and each WSB Subsidiary have filed all
material federal, state and other income, franchise or other tax returns,
required to be filed by them; each such return is complete and accurate in all
material respects; and all taxes and related interest and liabilities to be

established for the timely payment thereof. WSB and each of the WSB Banks have
timely and accurately filed all material currency transaction reports required
by the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, and have timely and accurately filed all
material required information returns and reports, including without

date which has not been paid or for which adequate reserve has not been
provided, and the Officers of WSB and each WSB Bank have no Knowledge of any
pending or threatened (in writing) audit or investigation of WSB or any of the
WSB Banks with respect to any tax liabilities. There are currently no
agreements in effect with respect to WSB or any of the WSB Banks to extend the
period of limitations for assessment or

   collection of any tax. WSB has delivered to Umpqua true and correct copies
of WSB\'s and any of the WSB Banks\' unconsolidated or uncombined federal and

Banks leases real property and material personal property, copies of which
have also been delivered to Umpqua, are the legal, valid and binding
obligation of WSB or the applicable WSB Bank, enforceable against such entity
in accordance with its terms, and, to the Knowledge of WSB, are the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the other party thereto, enforceable against
such entity in accordance with its terms, in each case subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights and to
general equity principles valid, and neither WSB nor the applicable WSB Bank
nor, to the Knowledge of WSB, the other party thereto is in material default,
and no event has occurred that would, with the giving of notice, lapse of time
or both, constitute a material default under such leases. No material waiver

taxes not yet due, for which WSB maintains reserves as required by GAAP
consistently applied with the WSB Public Reports, (2) pledges of assets
in the ordinary course of business to secure public deposits, (3) defects and
irregularities of title and encumbrances that do not materially impair the use
thereof for the purposes for which they are held, (4) mechanics\',
materialmen\'s, workmen\'s, repairmen\'s, warehousemen\'s, carriers\' and
other similar liens, for sums not yet delinquent or which are being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings, arising in the ordinary course of
business for which WSB maintains reserves as required by GAAP consistently
applied with the WSB Public Reports and (5) adverse claims with respect to
properties and assets the loss of which would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to WSB ("Permitted Liens"). All buildings and structures on the real
property, the equipment located thereon, and the real and personal property
leased by WSB or any of the WSB Banks, are in all material respects in
good operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted). WSB
and the WSB Banks have good and marketable title to all of their owned real
and personal property, subject to no mortgages, pledges, encumbrances, liens
or charges of any kind, except for Permitted Liens.

 

  4.19 _Insurance_. For each of the past three years and continuing
through the date hereof, WSB and each of the WSB Banks have insured their
business and real and personal property against all risks of a character
usually insured against, including but not limited to financial institution
bond, directors and officers liability, property and casualty and commercial
liability insurance, with customary amounts of coverage, deductibles and
exclusions by reputable insurers authorized to transact insurance in the State
of California and such other jurisdictions where they do business or own

respect to WSB.

Schedule is a list of (i) all existing oral or written contracts, agreements
or leases to which WSB or any of the WSB Banks is a party or to which any of
their properties are subject that individually or together with all related
existing oral or written contracts, agreements or leases that involve a

leases with current officers and directors and any persons who have been an
officer or director within the past three years of WSB or any of the WSB
Banks, other than documentation regarding deposits and documentation

which terms are no more favorable than those available to unaffiliated parties
made at or about the same time (collectively, "Material Contracts").

 

  Neither WSB nor any of the WSB Banks is in material default or breach,
and there has not occurred any event which with notice or lapse of time would
constitute a material breach or default by any such entity, under any
Material Contract, and to the Knowledge of WSB, no other party thereto is in
material default thereof. No consent or approval by the other parties to any
Material Contract is required by reason of this Agreement to maintain such
oral or written contracts, agreements or leases in effect.

   \t   \t|  4.22 \t \t|   _Employee Benefits._ \t  
---|---|--- 
  

  (a) Each Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by WSB,
or any entity which is considered one employer with WSB as determined under
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("ERISA Affiliate"), is disclosed
in the WSB Disclosure Schedule. Neither WSB nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains
nor sponsors any other pension, profit sharing, thrift, savings, bonus,
retirement, vacation, life insurance, health insurance, severance, sickness,
disability, medical or death benefit plans, whether or not subject to ERISA.
There are no other compensation, employment, stock options, stock purchase
agreements, life, health, accident or other insurance, bonus, deferred or
incentive compensation, change-in-control, severance or separation, profit
sharing, retirement, or other employee fringe benefit policies or
arrangements of any kind that could result in the payment to any current or
former employees, consultants or any of their beneficiaries of WSB or any of
the WSB Banks of any money or other property. The only "employee welfare
benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) sponsored or maintained
by WSB or any ERISA Affiliate, or to which WSB or any ERISA Affiliate
contributes ("Welfare Benefit Plan") or are required to contribute, are as set
forth Section 4.22 of the WSB Disclosure Schedule.

 

    (b) There are no employment contracts entered into by WSB or any
of the WSB Banks and no other deferred compensation contracts, agreements,
arrangements or commitments maintained or agreed to by either of them that
provides for or could result in the payment to any WSB, ACB, CCB, LCB, WSNB
employee or former employee of any money or other property rights, in either
case in an amount that would be material, or that would accelerate
the vesting or payment of such amounts or rights to any employee as a result
of the transactions contemplated herein. No such payment or acceleration set
forth in Section 4.22 of the WSB Disclosure Schedule would constitute an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G.

 

  (c) Neither WSB nor any ERISA Affiliate has maintained a
single-employer pension benefit plan that is subject to title 1, subtitle B,
part 3 of ERISA within six years of the date hereof (each, a "Pension Benefit
Plan"). With respect to any such Pension Benefit Plan, the amount of
liability for any contribution paid or owing with respect to such Pension
Benefit Plan for the last or current plan year and the plan year in which the
Effective Date occurs will be provided as Section 4.22 of the WSB Disclosure
Schedule within two business days. Under each Pension Benefit Plan, as of the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit

   liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension
Benefit Plan\'s most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the
then current value of the assets of such Pension Benefit Plan, and there has
been no material change in the financial condition, whether or not as a result
of a change in the funding method, of such Pension Benefit Plan since the last
day of the most recent plan year.

 

  (d) WSB and, to the Knowledge of WSB, all persons having
fiduciary or other responsibilities or duties with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan, are, and have since inception been, in substantial compliance in
all material respects with, and each such Employee Benefit Plan is and has
been operated substantially in accordance with its provisions and in
compliance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations governing such
Employee Benefit Plan, including, without limitation, the rules and
regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service under ERISA or the Code.
Each Pension Benefit Plan and any related trust agreements or annuity
contracts (or any other funding instruments) substantially comply both as to
form and operation, with the provisions of ERISA and the Code (including
Section 410(b) of the Code relating to coverage), where required in order to
be tax-qualified under Section 401(a) or 403(a) or other applicable
provisions of the Code, and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations;
all material governmental approvals for the Employee Benefit Plans have been
obtained; and a favorable determination or opinion as to the qualification
under the Code of each Pension Benefit Plan described in Section 4.22 of the
WSB Disclosure Schedule has been made or given by the Internal Revenue Service
covering all tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 or such letter or opinion has been applied for
within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the
Code. No Employee Benefit Plan or Pension Benefit Plan is a "multi-employer
pension plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. To the
Knowledge of WSB, all contributions or other amounts payable by WSB or any of
the WSB Banks as of the date hereof with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan
in respect of current or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and, to the extent
applicable, Section 412 of the Code, and there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of WSB, threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine claims
for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any Employee Benefit Plan, or any
trusts related thereto which would, individually or in the aggregate, have or
be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to WSB.

 

  (e) Each Welfare Benefit Plan and each Pension Benefit Plan has
been administered to date in material compliance with the requirements of the
claims procedure of the Code and ERISA. All reports required by any
government agency and disclosures to participants with respect to each Welfare
Benefit Plan and each Pension Benefit Plan have been timely made or filed.
Each Employee Benefit Plan is in material compliance with the
governing instruments and applicable federal or state law. In particular, but
without limitation, each Welfare Benefit Plan is in material compliance with
federal law, including without limitation the health care continuation
requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985,
as amended ("COBRA"). No Employee Benefit Plan provides benefits, including
without limitation death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with
respect to current or former employees of WSB or any ERISA Affiliate beyond
their retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage
mandated by applicable law, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under
any "employee pension plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2)
of ERISA, (iii) any deferred compensation benefits fully accrued as
liabilities on the books of WSB or any ERISA Affiliate or (iv) benefits the
full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or his
beneficiary).

 

   (f) Neither WSB nor, to the Knowledge of WSB, any plan
fiduciary of any Welfare Benefit Plan or Pension Benefit Plan, has engaged in
any transaction in violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA (for which no
exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or for which no exemption has been
granted by the Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service) or any
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code) for
which no exemption exists under Section 4975(c)(2) or

   (d) of the Code or for which no exemption has been granted by the Department
of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service. To the Knowledge of WSB, neither WSB
nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction in connection with which
WSB or any ERISA Affiliate could be subject to either a material civil penalty
assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material tax imposed
pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

  (g)  Complete and correct copies of the following documents have
been furnished to Umpqua:

Banks other than as an owner of outstanding securities or deposit accounts of

shall be subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted
by their terms.

employee benefit plans in effect at the Effective Date (provided that at
renewal dates, co-payments, employee

   contributions, deductible limits and other cost-sharing arrangements may be
modified to reflect any increase in the costs of such benefits), (ii) modify
the WSB employee benefits plans to provide for benefits that would, in the
aggregate, be substantially similar to those provided to WSB and the WSB
Banks\' employees at the Effective Date, or (iii) may shift WSB and the WSB
Banks\' employees to the benefit programs then made available to Umpqua
employees (the "Benefits Integration") with credit for service with WSB and
the WSB Banks accrued (or otherwise credited by WSB and the WSB Banks) prior
to the Benefits Integration deemed service with Umpqua for eligibility and
vesting purposes (and levels of benefits); provided, however, that in each
case, for the period from the Effective Time through December 31, 2006, the

that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those employee benefits
provided to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

  (c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.12(a) with respect to
individuals with employment or other agreements that provide for severance
payments, WSB and the WSB Banks\' employees, who by reason of the

terminated other than for cause by such entity, will be provided with
severance benefits by Umpqua based on the Umpqua Bank Severance Policy as
currently in effect as of the date of this Agreement, a copy of which has
been provided to WSB. Consistent with Section 7.12(b), WSB and the WSB Banks\'

the Mergers or otherwise, will receive full credit for prior service accrued
(or otherwise credited) with WSB and WSB Banks, plus service following the
Effective Time, for purposes of determining the amount of such severance
benefits. This Section 7.12(c) does not affect retention or incentive payments
that are otherwise due to such employees.

 

  (d) For purposes of vacation benefits, service accrued (or otherwise
credited) with WSB and the WSB Banks shall be credited for determining an
employee\'s eligibility and length of vacation under the Umpqua vacation
plan, and any vacation taken prior to the Benefits Integration will be
subtracted under the Umpqua plan from the employee\'s vacation entitlement for
the calendar year in which the Benefits Integration occurs.

waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to employees of WSB and the WSB Banks under any Umpqua health and
welfare plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, and deductibles, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments
made by such employees during the applicable plan year under WSB\'s health
and welfare plans but prior to the date such employee first participates in
the applicable Umpqua plan, shall reduce the amount of deductibles,
coinsurance and out-of-pocket payments under the Umpqua plan.

   \t 7.13 \t \t|   _Indemnification of Directors and Officers; D
andO Insurance_.\t  
---|--- 
  

  (a) From and after the Effective Time, Umpqua shall indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (and
Umpqua shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former
director and officer of WSB and WSB Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

   investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that Umpqua shall not be required to
indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant hereto if it shall be determined that
the Indemnified Party acted in bad faith and not in a manner such Party
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of WSB.

 

  (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 7.13, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Umpqua thereof,
but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Umpqua of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice
the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) Umpqua shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
Umpqua shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses
of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Umpqua elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between Umpqua and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Umpqua shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Umpqua shall
be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter and (iii) Umpqua shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Umpqua shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that
the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable law.

 

  (c) Umpqua shall maintain WSB\'s existing officers\' and directors\'
liability insurance for a period of 3 years after the Effective Time (or if
the cost exceeds $300,000, such period that can be purchased for $300,000) or
otherwise provide comparable insured coverage for such period.

 

  (d) If Umpqua or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
surviving corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.13.

 

  (e) The provisions of this Section 7.13 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.

---|--- 
  

   11.1 _Procedure for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated
before the Effective Date 

 

  (a) By the mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of Umpqua and WSB
acknowledged in writing;

 

  (b) By Umpqua or WSB acting through their Boards of Directors upon
written notice to the other party, if at the time of such notice the Mergers
shall not have become effective by October 31, 2006 (or such later date as
shall have been agreed to in writing by Umpqua and WSB acting through their
respective Boards of Directors) except to the extent that the failure of the
Mergers then to be

   consummated arises out of or results from the knowing action or inaction of
such party, which action or inaction is in violation of its obligations under
this Agreement;

 

  (c) By Umpqua, acting through its Board of Directors upon written
notice to WSB, if there has been a breach by WSB in its representations,
warranties or covenants set forth herein such that Section 8.8 or 8.9 would
not be satisfied and which misrepresentation, breach or failure is not cured
within thirty (30) days notice to WSB of such misrepresentation, breach
or failure; or by WSB, acting through its Board of Directors upon written
notice to Umpqua, if there has been a breach by Umpqua in its representations,
warranties or covenants set forth herein such that Section 9.7 or 9.8 would
not be satisfied and which misrepresentation, breach or failure is not cured
within thirty (30) days notice to Umpqua of such misrepresentation, breach or
failure;

 

  (d) By WSB, if its Board of Director determines in good faith (after
consultation with Sullivan and Cromwell LLP) that such action is required in
order for the directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under
applicable law; or

 

  (e) By WSB, if (1) there has been a significant decline in the price of
Umpqua Common Stock, measured by the Umpqua Measuring Price, (2) such decline
is not proportionate relative to the Index, (3) WSB delivers written notice to
Umpqua of its intention to terminate this Agreement within forty-eight (48)
hours following the date of such event and (4) Umpqua does not elect to
pursue a Decline Adjustment as set forth below; provided, however, that, if
Umpqua effects a stock dividend, stock split, combination, exchange of shares
or similar transaction after the date hereof and prior to the date on which
the Umpqua Measuring Price is determined, the provisions of this Section
11.1(e) shall be appropriately adjusted so that such event does not in and of
itself trigger a termination right on behalf of WSB. For purposes hereof, the
following terms have the following meanings:

 

  (i) "Index" means the NASDAQ Bank Index.

 

  (ii) "Initial Index" shall mean 3,126.17.

 

  (iii) "Final Index" shall mean the average of the
closing prices of the Index for the Umpqua Measuring Period.

 

  (iv) "Minimum Adjustment Price" means $22.59, which
represents 80% of the Umpqua Initial Price.

 

  (v) A "significant decline" shall be deemed to have
occurred if the Umpqua Measuring Price is less than the Minimum Adjustment
Price.

 

  (vi) A decrease is not "proportionate relative to the
Index" if the quotient obtained by dividing the Umpqua Measuring Price by the
Umpqua Initial Price is less than the quotient obtained by dividing the Final
Index by the Initial Index and subtracting 0.10 from the quotient. (vii)
"Umpqua Initial Price" means $28.24.

 

  (viii) "Umpqua Measuring Period" means the fifteen day
trading day period ending on the fifth business day prior to the Effective
Date.

 

  (ix) "Umpqua Measuring Price" means the average closing
price of Umpqua Common Stock on NASDAQ over the Umpqua Measuring Period.

 

 Notwithstanding any decrease in the price of Umpqua Common Stock, as set
forth in this Section 11.1(e), WSB shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(e) if Umpqua elects,

   no later than the close of business on the second succeeding Business Day
after the close of the Umpqua Measuring Period, to adjust the Exchange Ratio
(a "Decline Adjustment") such that the Exchange Ratio shall equal the number
derived by multiplying the unadjusted Exchange Ratio times the quotient
obtained by dividing the Minimum Adjustment Price by the Umpqua Measuring
Price.

 

  (f) By WSB or Umpqua, acting through its Board of Directors, if any
Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of any of the Mergers shall become final and non-appealable
(whether before or after the approval by the shareholders of WSB or Umpqua).

 

  (g) By either party if (i) WSB shareholders fail to approve the
principal terms of this Agreement at a meeting held pursuant to Section 6.10
or any adjournments or postponements thereof or (ii) Umpqua shareholders fail
to approve this Agreement, the Holding Company Plan of Merger or the issuance
of shares of Umpqua Common Stock contemplated hereby at a meeting held
pursuant to Section 7.8 or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

   11.2.1 In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
11.1(a) or 11.1(b),  11.1(e) or 11.1(f), this Agreement shall become wholly
void and of no further force and effect and there shall be no liability on the
part of any party or its respective Board of Directors as a result of such
termination or abandonment.

 

  11.2.2 If this Agreement is terminated by WSB or Umpqua pursuant to
Section 11.1(g)(i) (provided that no failure of any covenant, condition,
representation or warranty on the part of Umpqua or within the reasonable
control of WSB shall have proximately caused the failure of WSB shareholders
to have approved the principal terms of this Agreement), by Umpqua pursuant
to Section 11.1(c) or by WSB pursuant to Section 11.1(d), then WSB agrees to
pay to Umpqua its reasonable expenses incurred in entering into and attempting
to consummate the transaction up to a maximum of $600,000, to be paid within
thirty (30) days after Umpqua\'s request; provided, however, if Umpqua has
terminated the Agreement as a result of WSB\'s willful failure to comply with
any material covenant set forth in Section 6, it agrees to pay Umpqua an
additional $3,000,000, to be paid within thirty (30) days after Umpqua\'s
request. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1(g)(i) or
Section 11.1(d), or by Umpqua pursuant to Section 11.1(c) and WSB enters into
an Alternative Acquisition Transaction prior to the date that is 12 months
from the date of termination and such Alternative Acquisition Transaction had
been proposed prior to the date of the WSB shareholder meeting in the case of
termination pursuant to Section 11.1(g)(i) or prior to the date of
termination in the case of termination pursuant to Section 11.1(c) or 11.1(d);
and provided that in any of such events if, at the time of WSB\'s shareholder
meeting there was no material failure by Umpqua to comply with the covenants
set forth in Section 7 and to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 9.1
(if the shareholders of Umpqua shall have met by the date of the termination)
and Sections 9.7 and 9.9, then WSB will, within thirty (30) days after
Umpqua\'s request, pay Umpqua the sum of $14,000,000 (reduced by any amounts
paid or payable pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph). This
Section 11.2.2 shall be the sole remedy in favor of Umpqua for termination of
this Agreement pursuant to the sections named in the first sentence, and
Umpqua specifically waives the protections of any other legal or equitable
remedies that otherwise might be available to Umpqua.

 

  11.2.3 If this Agreement is terminated by Umpqua or WSB pursuant to
Section 11.1(g)(ii) (provided that no failure of any covenant, condition,
representation or warranty on the part of WSB or within the reasonable control
of Umpqua shall have proximately caused the failure of Umpqua shareholders to
have approved the Agreement, the Holding Company Plan of Merger or the
issuance of shares of Umpqua Common Stock contemplated hereby) or by WSB
pursuant to Section

   11.1(c), then Umpqua agrees to pay to WSB its reasonable expenses incurred
in entering into and attempting to consummate the transaction up to a maximum
of $600,000; provided, however, if WSB has terminated the Agreement as a
result of Umpqua\'s willful failure to comply with any material covenant set
forth in Section 7, it agrees to pay WSB an additional $3,000,000. This
Section 11.2.3 shall be the sole remedy in favor of WSB for termination of
this Agreement pursuant to the sections named in the first sentence, and WSB
specifically waives the protections of any other legal or equitable remedies
that otherwise might be available to WSB.
