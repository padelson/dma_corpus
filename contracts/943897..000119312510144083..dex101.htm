2010      

_Exhibit 10.1_

 

 _MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT_

 

This Management Services Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of June 16, 2010, by and among BWAY Holding Company, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Picasso Parent Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Buyer Parent_ "), Madison Dearborn Partners V-B, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (" _MDP V-B_"), and Madison Dearborn Partners
VI-B, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _MDP VI-B_" and, together with
MDP V-B, " _MDP_ ").

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
March 28, 2010, by and among the Company, Buyer Parent and Picasso Merger
Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of
Buyer Parent (" _Buyer_ ") (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), Buyer shall merge
with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation,
such that, following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, Buyer Parent shall become the indirect sole shareholder of
the Company (the " _Acquisition_ "). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger
Agreement.

WHEREAS, effective as of the Effective Date, Buyer Parent and the Company
desire to retain MDP to perform certain management and consulting services on
the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, and MDP
desires to perform such services. 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the mutual covenants
contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound,
hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Appointment_. The Company appoints MDP and MDP accepts appointment on the
terms and conditions provided in this Agreement as an advisor to the Company
and its subsidiaries and its direct and indirect parent companies
(collectively, the " _Company Group_ "), including any other corporations or
other entities hereafter formed or acquired by any member of the Company
Group to engage in any business. The parties expressly acknowledge that MDP is
an affiliate of Madison Dearborn Capital Partners V-A, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (" _MDCP V-A_ "), Madison Dearborn Capital Partners
V-C, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _MDCP V-C_ "), Madison Dearborn
Capital Partners V Executive-A, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _MDCP
V Executive_ "), Madison Dearborn Capital Partners VI-A, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (" _MDCP VI-A_ "), Madison Dearborn Capital
Partners VI-C, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _MDCP VI-C_ ") and
Madison Dearborn Capital Partners VI Executive-A, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (" _MDCP VI Executive_ " and, together with MDCP V-A,
MDCP V-C, MDCP V Executive, MDCP VI-A and MDCP VI-C, the " _Sponsors_ "), and
that the Sponsors are equityholders in Buyer Parent. Additionally, the
parties expressly acknowledge that certain principals of the Sponsors
currently serve as members of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Board_ ") and/or members of the board of directors (or board of managers, as
applicable) of the other companies in the Company Group. It is understood
that MDPs rights and obligations hereunder shall be independent of the
relationship between the Company and the Sponsors and the respective boards of
directors (or managers, as applicable) of the Company and the other members
of the Company Group, and that, in performing its services hereunder, MDP is
not acting in the capacity of an equityholder of Buyer Parent or any of its
subsidiaries or a member of the board of directors (or managers, as
applicable) of the Company or any other member of the Company Group. 2\. _Board of Directors Supervision_. The activities of MDP to be performed
under this Agreement shall be subject to the supervision of the Board and
subject to reasonable policies not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement adopted by the Board and in effect from time to time. Where not
required by applicable law or regulation, MDP shall not require the prior
approval of the Board to perform its duties under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, MDP shall not have the authority to bind the
Company or any other member of the Company Group, and nothing
contained herein shall be construed to create an agency relationship between
the Company or any other member of the Company Group and MDP.

 

3\. _Term_. MDPs engagement under this Agreement shall be in effect for an
initial term commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the tenth
anniversary of the Effective Date (the " _Initial Term_ "), and shall be
automatically extended thereafter on a year to year basis unless MDP provides
written notice of its desire to terminate its engagement under this Agreement
to the other parties not less than 90 days prior to the expiration of the
Initial Term or any one year extension thereof (in which case the Term shall
terminate on such tenth anniversary or such one-year anniversary
thereafter). The Initial Term, as extended for one or more one year extension
periods (if any), is referred to herein as the " _Term_ ". In addition, MDP
may terminate its engagement under this Agreement at any time upon 90 days
written notice to the Company. No termination of MDPs engagement under this
Agreement, whether pursuant to this _Section 3_ or otherwise, shall affect
the Companys obligations with respect to the fees, costs and expenses
incurred by MDP in rendering services hereunder and not reimbursed by the
Company as of the effective date of such termination.

4.  _Services_. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law or
regulation, MDP shall perform or cause to be performed such services for Buyer
Parent and/or its subsidiaries as mutually agreed by MDP and Buyer Parents
board of managers, which may include, without limitation, the following:

(a) general strategic advisory services;

 

(b) identification, support, negotiation and analysis of acquisitions and
dispositions by Buyer Parent or its subsidiaries;

 

(c) support, negotiation and analysis of financing alternatives, including,
without limitation, in connection with acquisitions, capital expenditures and
refinancing of existing indebtedness;

(d) finance functions, including assistance in the preparation of financial
projections and monitoring of compliance with financing agreements;

(e) marketing functions, including monitoring of marketing plans and
strategies;

(f) human resources functions, including searching and hiring of executives;
and 



 

-2- (g) other services for Buyer Parent and its subsidiaries upon which Buyer
Parents board of managers and MDP agree.

5\. _Compensation_.

 

(a) _Transaction Fee_. In consideration of the management, consulting and
financial services required in connection with certain corporate events, MDP
shall be entitled to customary and reasonable fees for such services provided
to the Company and/or to other members of the Company Group, including,
without limitation, with respect to refinancings, restructurings, equity
or debt offerings, dividends and distributions, amounts paid by members of
the Company Group to repurchase any of their securities, acquisitions,
mergers, consolidations, business combinations, sales and divestitures (each a
" _Consulting Event_ "). The fees payable to MDP in connection with any
Consulting Event shall be as follows: (i) a fee (the " _Transaction Fee_ ")
equal to one percent (1%) of the Consideration (as defined below) shall be
payable upon the closing of a Consulting Event, or (ii) if any of the members
of the Company Group receives any payment or fee (each, a " _Fee_ ") from
another person in connection with the termination, abandonment or failure to
occur of any proposed Consulting Event, then the Company shall, or shall
cause the applicable member(s) of the Company Group to, pay to MDP a fee in an
amount equal to the Fee upon the receipt of the Fee; _provided_ , that in no
event shall the amount payable under this paragraph exceed the amount of the
Transaction Fee that would have been payable to MDP if the Consulting Event
had been consummated. MDP will be entitled to receive the compensation
provided for above if the events specified above occur or an agreement is
entered into which subsequently results in a Fee. As used herein, the term "
_Consideration_ " shall mean the aggregate transaction value of such
Consulting Event (including the value of any debt or liabilities assumed). If
a Consulting Event results in a material portion (but less than all) of the
stock of the Company Group having been acquired and in connection therewith
there is a reasonable expectation that substantially all of the stock of the
Company Group will be acquired within one year of the date of the Consulting
Event ( _e.g._ , an initial public offering followed by secondary sales), the
Transaction Fee shall be calculated as if there was an acquisition of stock in
which all of the stock of the Company Group had been acquired on the date of
the Consulting Event ( _e.g._ , the date of the initial public offering) and,
if so calculated, then no further Transaction Fee shall be paid or payable on
the subsequent sale of the stock of the Company Group. No reduction shall be
made in determining the Consideration for the fact that proceeds may be
reduced, returned or offset for indemnification or similar obligations.

 

(b) Any payment pursuant to _Section 5(a)_ above shall be made in cash by
wire transfer(s) of immediately available funds to or among one or more
accounts as designated from time to time by MDP to the Company in writing. If
any individual payment to MDP pursuant to _Section 5(a)_ above would be less
than $10,000, then such payment shall be held by the Company until the first
to occur of (i) such time as the aggregate of such payments equals or exceeds
$10,000, and (ii) the effective date of the termination of this Agreement, at
which time such held amount shall be paid in full.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that, in satisfaction of obligations of
Buyer Parent due under that certain Equity Financing Commitment Letter, dated
as of March 28, 2010, by and among Buyer Parent and the Sponsors, Buyer Parent
shall pay to each of MDP V-B and to MDP VI-B (or a respective designee
thereof) a closing fee in the amount of $2,500,000 upon the consummation of
the Acquisition.



 

-3- 6\. _Reimbursement of Expenses; Independent Contractor_. All obligations or
expenses incurred by MDP in the performance of its duties under this
Agreement shall be for the account of, on behalf of, and at the expense of the
Company, and all such expenses shall be promptly reimbursed by the Company.
MDP shall not be obligated to make any advance to or for the account of the
Company or any other member of the Company Group or to pay any sums, except
out of funds held in accounts maintained by the Company or any other member of
the Company Group, nor shall MDP be obligated to incur any liability or
obligation for the account of the Company or any other member of the Company
Group. In addition, the Company shall pay to MDP, and hold MDP harmless
against liability for the payment of any taxes, fees and expenses arising
or otherwise incurred in connection with the investment in the Company and/or
Buyer Parent by any member of the MDP Group (as defined below). The Company
shall reimburse MDP by wire transfer of immediately available funds for any
such amount owed to MDP and/or any member of the MDP Group pursuant to this
_Section 6_, which shall be in addition to any other amount payable to MDP
under this Agreement. MDP shall be an independent contractor, and nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to (i) create a partnership or
joint venture between the Company or any other member of the Company Group and
MDP, (ii) cause MDP to be responsible in any way for the debts, liabilities or
obligations of the Company or any other party, or (iii) cause MDP or any of
its partners or employees to be officers, employees or agents of the Company
or any other member of the Company Group.

 

7\. _Deferral of Amounts Due_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, MDP shall have the right at any time, at its sole
discretion, to defer any amounts due to be paid to MDP hereunder until such
time as MDP shall determine; _provided_ that no such deferral shall be deemed
in any event to be a waiver of MDPs right to receive such payment
or otherwise as a release of the Companys, Buyer Parents or any member of
the Company Groups obligations to pay any such amounts deferred hereunder, as
applicable.

 

8\. _Personnel_. MDP will provide and devote to the performance of this
Agreement such partners, employees and agents of MDP as MDP shall deem
appropriate to the furnishing of the services mutually agreed upon by Buyer
Parent and MDP. The fees and other compensation specified in this Agreement
will be payable by the Company regardless of the extent of services requested
by Buyer Parent or performed by MDP pursuant to this Agreement, and
regardless of whether or not Buyer Parent requests MDP to provide any such
services.



 

-4- 9\. _Liability_. Neither MDP nor any of its affiliates, nor any of their
respective partners, members, employees or agents, nor any persons or
entities acting for or on behalf of such persons (collectively, the " _MDP
Group_ "), shall be liable to Buyer Parent, its current, future or former
subsidiaries or any of their affiliates for any loss, liability, damage or
expense (including attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, a " _Loss_ ")
arising out of or in connection with the performance of services contemplated
by this Agreement. MDP makes no representations or warranties, express or
implied, in respect of the services provided by any member of the MDP Group.
Except as MDP may otherwise agree in writing after the date hereof: (i) each
member of the MDP Group shall have the right to, and shall have no duty
(contractual or otherwise) not to, directly or indirectly: (A) engage in the
same or similar business activities or lines of business as Buyer Parent, its
current, future or former subsidiaries or any of their affiliates and (B) do
business with any client or customer of Buyer Parent, its current, future or
former subsidiaries or any of their affiliates; (ii) no member of the MDP
Group shall be liable to Buyer Parent, its current, future or former
subsidiaries or any of their affiliates for breach of any duty (contractual or
otherwise) by reason of any such activities or of such persons participation
therein; and (iii) in the event that any member of the MDP Group
acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a
corporate opportunity for both Buyer Parent, its current, future or former
subsidiaries or any of their affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of
the MDP Group, on the other hand, or any other person, no member of the MDP
Group shall have any duty (contractual or otherwise) to communicate or present
such corporate opportunity to Buyer Parent, its current, future or former
subsidiaries or any of their affiliates and, notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, shall not be liable to Buyer Parent, its
current, future or former subsidiaries or any of their affiliates for breach
of any duty (contractual or otherwise) by reason of the fact that any member
of the MDP Group directly or indirectly pursues or acquires such opportunity
for itself, directs such opportunity to another person, or does not present
such opportunity to Buyer Parent, its current, future or former subsidiaries
or any of their affiliates.

10\. _Indemnity_. The Company and the other members of the Company Group
hereby agree to jointly and severally defend, indemnify and hold harmless
each member of the MDP Group from and against any and all Losses arising from
any claim by any person or entity with respect to, or in any way related to,
this Agreement or the investment by any member of the MDP Group in the
Company and/or Buyer Parent (collectively, " _Claims_ ") resulting from any
act or omission of any member of the MDP Group. The Company and the other
members of the Company Group shall defend at their own cost and expense any
and all suits or actions (just or unjust) which may be brought against Buyer
Parent, its current, future or former subsidiaries or any of their affiliates,
or any member of the MDP Group or in which any member of the MDP Group may
be impleaded with others upon any Claims, or upon any matter, directly or
indirectly related to or arising out of this Agreement or the performance
hereof by any member of the MDP Group.

 

11\. _Arbitration_.

 

(a) If a Dispute arises between the parties, the parties agree to use the
following procedures in good faith to resolve such Dispute promptly,
privately and non-judicially. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Dispute_ "
shall mean any alleged material breach of any representation, warranty or
obligation herein, or a disagreement regarding the
interpretation, performance or nonperformance of any provision thereof, or
the validity, scope and enforceability of these dispute resolution procedures,
or any dispute regarding any damages arising from the termination of this
Agreement. Any party may give written notice to any other party of the
existence of a Dispute (a " _Dispute Notice_ ").

(b) Within ten (10) days after delivery of any Dispute Notice the parties
involved in the Dispute shall meet at a mutually agreeable time and place and
thereafter as often as they deem reasonably necessary to exchange relevant
information and attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the
Dispute. If the Dispute has not been resolved within ten (10) days after the
first meeting of the parties, or, if the party receiving the Dispute Notice
will not meet within ten (10) days after receipt of the Dispute Notice, then
any party may, by delivering notice to the other part(ies), commence
arbitration proceedings.



 

-5- (c) If the parties can agree to a single arbitrator within 30 days following
one party receiving a Dispute Notice from another party, such arbitrator
shall be chosen. The arbitrator(s) shall not be required to have
qualifications other than a reasonable amount of experience and specialty in
the area which is the subject of the dispute. If the parties do not agree as
to the choice of an arbitrator, each party shall choose an arbitrator within
ten (10) days after the expiration of the 30-day period referred to above and
the arbitrators so chosen shall choose an additional arbitrator within 20
days after the date on which second of the arbitrator chosen by the parties is
chosen. If at the end of such 20 day period the parties designated
arbitrators cannot agree on the selection of the third arbitrator, such
selection shall be made by the American Arbitration Association upon the
application of any party.

(d) The parties acknowledge that the provisions of this _Section 11_ are
intended to provide a private resolution of Disputes between them.
Accordingly, all documents, records, and other information relating to the
Dispute shall at all times be maintained in the strictest confidence and not
disclosed to any third party, other than the arbitrators, except where
specifically allowed hereunder. All proceedings, communications and
negotiations pursuant to this _Section 11_ are confidential. In the event of
any judicial challenge to, or enforcement of, any order or award hereunder,
any party may designate such portions of the record of such proceedings,
communications, and negotiations as such party deems appropriate to be filed
under seal. All proceedings, communications and negotiations pursuant to this
_Section 11_ shall be treated as compromise negotiations for all purposes,
including for purposes of the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules
of evidence. None of the statements, disclosures, offers, or communications
(or other assertions made in any proceeding or negotiation) made pursuant to
this _Section 11_ shall be deemed admissions, nor shall any of said
statements, disclosures, offers, communications or assertions be admissible
for any purpose other than the enforcement of the terms of this _Section 11_.

 

(e) The parties agree to act in good faith to comply with all of their
respective obligations under this Agreement as much as possible as if there
were no Dispute during any pending mediation or arbitration hereunder.

(f) All deadlines specified in this  _Section 11_ may be extended by mutual
agreement. The procedures specified in this _Section 11_ are an essential
provision of the Agreement and are legally binding on the parties. These
procedures shall be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of
any Dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
Any and all actions to enforce the obligations under this _Section 11_ shall
be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section
16_ hereof.

(g) The parties agree to have any Dispute decided by neutral arbitration as
provided in this _Section 11_ and the parties are giving up any rights they
might possess to have the Dispute litigated in a court or by a jury trial. The
parties are giving up their judicial rights to discovery and appeal, unless
such rights are specifically included in this _Section 11_. The parties
acknowledge and agree that their agreement to this arbitration provision is
voluntary.

Equity Financing Commitment Letter, dated as of March 28, 2010, by and among
the Sponsors and Buyer Parent. No modifications of this Agreement or waiver of
the terms or conditions thereof shall be binding upon any party unless
approved in writing by an authorized representative of such party. All issues
concerning this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice

jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

obligations of the Company hereunder.

18\. _Attorney s Fees_. If any action or proceeding, whether at law, in
equity or in arbitration, is necessary or desirable to enforce or interpret
the terms of this Agreement or to protect the rights obtained hereunder, then
MDP shall be entitled to recover from the Company its reasonable attorneys
fees incurred in connection therewith in addition to any relief to which it
may be entitled.

 

19\. _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
provisions of _Section 6_, _Section 9_,  _Section 10_ and _Section 11_
hereof shall survive expiration of the Term and termination of this Agreement
and no expiration of the Term or termination of MDPs engagement under this
Agreement shall limit the rights or remedies of MDP for accrued but unpaid
fees or non-payment or other breach by Buyer Parent or the Company arising
prior to any such expiration or termination.
