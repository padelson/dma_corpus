<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(a) <I>Transaction Fee</I>. In consideration of the management, consulting and financial services required in connection with certain
corporate events, MDP shall be entitled to customary and reasonable fees for such services provided to the Company and/or to other members of the Company Group, including, without limitation, with respect to refinancings, restructurings, equity or
debt offerings, dividends and distributions, amounts paid by members of the Company Group to repurchase any of their securities, acquisitions, mergers, consolidations, business combinations, sales and divestitures (each a &#147;<U>Consulting
Event</U>&#148;). The fees payable to MDP in connection with any Consulting Event shall be as follows: (i)&nbsp;a fee (the &#147;<U>Transaction Fee</U>&#148;) equal to one percent&nbsp;(1%) of the Consideration (as defined below) shall be payable
upon the closing of a Consulting Event, or (ii)&nbsp;if any of the members of the Company Group receives any payment or fee (each, a &#147;<U>Fee</U>&#148;) from another person in connection with the termination, abandonment or failure to occur of
any proposed Consulting Event, then the Company shall, or shall cause the applicable member(s) of the Company Group to, pay to MDP a fee in an amount equal to the Fee upon the receipt of the Fee; <U>provided</U>, that in no event shall the amount
payable under this paragraph exceed the amount of the Transaction Fee that would have been payable to MDP if the Consulting Event had been consummated. MDP will be entitled to receive the compensation provided for above if the events specified above
occur or an agreement is entered into which subsequently results in a Fee. As used herein, the term &#147;<U>Consideration</U>&#148; shall mean the aggregate transaction value of such Consulting Event (including the value of any debt or liabilities
assumed). If a Consulting Event results in a material portion (but less than all) of the stock of the Company Group having been acquired and in connection therewith there is a reasonable expectation that substantially all of the stock of the Company
Group will be acquired within one year of the date of the Consulting Event (<I>e.g.</I>, an initial public offering followed by secondary sales), the Transaction Fee shall be calculated as if there was an acquisition of stock in which all of the
stock of the Company Group had been acquired on the date of the Consulting Event (<I>e.g.</I>, the date of the initial public offering) and, if so calculated, then no further Transaction Fee shall be paid or payable on the subsequent sale of the
stock of the Company Group. No reduction shall be made in determining the Consideration for the fact that proceeds may be reduced, returned or offset for indemnification or similar obligations. </FONT></P>

the first to occur of (i)&nbsp;such time as the aggregate of such payments equals or exceeds $10,000, and (ii)&nbsp;the effective date of the termination of this Agreement, at which time such held amount shall be paid in full. </FONT></P>
