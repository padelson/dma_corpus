(d) all liabilities and obligations of Seller under the plans set forth in
_Section 1.1(j)_ (and the insurance policies and other arrangements
underlying such plans) after the Closing Date, including liabilities for
claims thereunder that have been asserted on or prior to the Closing Date
or that are asserted after the Closing Date regardless of whether the events
that give rise to such claims occur on, prior to, or after the Closing Date;

 

(e) all current liabilities, accruals and expenses incurred in the ordinary
course of business since June 30, 2010;

 

(f) all liabilities and obligations of Seller related to product and service
warranty in the ordinary course of business (but not including product

(g) except as otherwise provided in _Section 1.4(f)_ above, all liabilities
and obligations of Seller related to or resulting from product or service
liability in connection with products or services, which were sold,
distributed or provided prior to Closing, including but not limited to any
product recalls but excluding any product or service liabilities or
obligation relating to claims asserted prior to the Closing; and



 

4 (h) any liability or obligation which accrues or arises from the Assets (or
the operation or use of any of the same) on or after the Closing Date.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Excluded Liabilities_ " shall mean any and
all liabilities, conditions or obligations of Seller not expressly and
specifically included within the definition of Assumed Liabilities. For the
avoidance of doubt, Excluded Liabilities includes, but is not limited to,

(A) any and all liabilities of or imposed on the Seller related or
attributable to Taxes;

 

(B) all Taxes related or attributable to the Assets for all periods prior to
the Closing Date;

 

(C) any and all Taxes of Seller, or Taxes relating or attributable to the

transaction (including transactions contemplated by this Agreement) occurring
before the Closing Date; and

(D) any liability or obligation of Seller which accrues or arises based upon
the operations of Seller prior to the Closing other than those which are

definition of Assumed Liabilities.

1.5.  _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place as soon as
practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to Closing
set forth herein or such other date as may be mutually agreed upon by the
parties hereto (such date of the Closing being hereinafter called the "
_Closing Date_ "); _provided_ , at FACs option the Closing shall not
occur until October 1, 2010. The Closing shall be deemed to have occurred
effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date.

1.6.  _Working Capital_.

(a) _Baseline Working Capital Amount; Working Capital Amount_. The " _Baseline
Working Capital Amount_ " shall mean $21,400,000, which is the Working
Capital Amount as set forth in the balance sheet of Seller contained in the
unaudited, consolidating management reports for Seller, GMIL, and the Company
Group as of March 31, 2010. The " _Working Capital Amount_ " shall mean, as
of a particular date, an amount equal to (i) the consolidated current assets
of Seller minus (ii) the consolidated current liabilities of
Seller (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, long-term portion of any
liabilities and deferred Tax liabilities that solely relate to the difference
between book income and taxable income), in each case calculated in accordance
and consistently with the past practices of Seller (" _Seller Accounting
Practices_ "). In calculating the Working Capital Amount, the calculation
shall be performed in a manner consistent with the example of the net working
capital calculation attached hereto as _Annex A_. For the avoidance of doubt,
for purposes of the calculation of the Working Capital Amount, all deferred
Tax liabilities of Seller shall be properly accrued on the balance sheet
contained in the unaudited, consolidating management reports for Seller in
accordance and consistently with its past practices, as adjusted in this
_Section 1.6(a)_ and _Annex A_ attached hereto.

  

 

5 (b) _Post-Closing Determination_. Within sixty (60) calendar days after
the Closing Date, Buyer, or its designee, will conduct a review of the
Working Capital Amount as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Working
Capital Amount_ ") and will prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative
a balance sheet as of 12:00:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date
Balance Sheet_ "), together with a computation of the Closing Date Working
Capital Amount and the Adjusted Closing Date Working Capital Amount (as
defined below). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the preparation of the balance sheet contained in the
unaudited management reports for Seller as of March 31, 2010. The Closing Date
Working Capital Amount shall be adjusted to: (i) (x) add the amount of any
net increase in net fixed assets (including notes receivables of shareholders
as set forth on _Annex A_ ) of Seller from March 31, 2010 to the Closing Date,
or (y) subtract the amount of any net decrease in net fixed assets (including
notes receivables of shareholders as set forth on _Annex A_ ) of Seller from
March 31, 2010 to the Closing Date, and (ii) (x) add the amount of any net
decrease in long term Indebtedness of Seller from March 31, 2010 to the
Closing Date or (y) subtract the amount of any net increase in long term
Indebtedness of Seller from March 31, 2010 to the Closing Date (as so
adjusted, (the " _Adjusted Closing Date Working Capital Amount_ ").

Seller and Buyer will make available to the Sellers Representative all
information, data, records and work papers used in preparing the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and calculating the working capital adjustment hereunder and
such other records and work papers as are necessary for the Sellers
Representative to review the calculations and to resolve any disputed related
thereto, including without limitation access to (and the ability to make
copies of) the books and records of Seller. Buyer further agrees to make its
personnel and accountants available to explain any information, data, records
and work papers used in preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
calculating the working capital adjustment hereunder.

 

If the Sellers Representative disagrees with the computation of the Adjusted
Closing Date Working Capital Amount or the items reflected on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet, the Sellers Representative may, within thirty (30)
calendar days after receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, deliver a
notice (a " _Working Capital Objection Notice_ ") to Buyer identifying with
reasonable specificity those items of the Closing Date Balance Sheet prepared
by Buyer to which the Sellers Representative is objecting and the amounts
with respect thereto that the Sellers Representative asserts to be the
correct amounts and setting forth the Sellers Representatives calculation of
the Adjusted Closing Date Working Capital Amount. If the Sellers
Representative does not deliver a Working Capital Objection Notice within
such thirty (30) calendar day period, then the Adjusted Closing Date Working
Capital Amount shall be deemed to be finally determined as the amount
calculated by Buyer. If the Sellers Representative timely delivers a Working
Capital Objection Notice to Buyer, the Sellers Representative and Buyer will
use reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreement as to the computation of
the Adjusted Closing Date Working Capital Amount as soon as practicable, but
if they cannot reach a final resolution within thirty (30) calendar days
after Buyer has received the Working Capital Objection Notice, Buyer and the
Sellers Representative will jointly retain a mutually agreeable independent
accounting firm of recognized national standing (the " _Working Capital Firm_
") to resolve their disagreement. If Buyer and the Sellers Representative are

 



 

6  unable to agree on the choice of the Working Capital Firm, then the Working
Capital Firm will be an independent accounting firm of recognized national
standing selected by lot (after excluding one firm designated by Buyer and
one firm designated by the Sellers Representative). Buyer and the Sellers
Representative will direct the Working Capital Firm to render a determination
as promptly as practicable but in no event later than forty-five (45)
calendar days of its retention. Buyer and the Sellers Representative and
their respective agents will cooperate fully with the Working Capital Firm
during its engagement to facilitate its resolution of the remaining disputes,
including by providing the information, data, records, and work papers used by
each party to calculate the adjustment amount due and the remaining disputes,
and making its personnel and accountants available to explain any
such information, data, records, or work papers. The Working Capital Firm
will consider only those items and amounts in the Closing Date Balance Sheet
set forth in the Working Capital Objection Notice which Buyer and the Sellers
Representative are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed item, the
Working Capital Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either party. The Working Capital Firms
determination will be based on such review as the Working Capital Firm deems
necessary to make its determination, and on the definition of the Adjusted
Closing Date Working Capital Amount included herein. The determination of the
Adjusted Closing Date Working Capital Amount by the Working Capital Firm will
be conclusive and binding upon Buyer, the Sellers Representative and Seller,
in the absence of fraud or manifest error. Each of the parties shall bear its
own costs and expenses in connection with the work of the Working Capital
Firm. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall bear the
costs and expenses of the Working Capital Firm based on the percentage which
the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by or on behalf of such party. The Adjusted Closing
Date Working Capital Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
1.6(b)_, is referred to herein as the " _Actual Closing Date Working Capital
Amount_."

(c) _Payment of Working Capital Adjustments_. (i) If the Actual Closing Date
Working Capital Amount exceeds the Baseline Working Capital Amount, Buyer
shall, within five (5) business days after the determination thereof, pay to
Seller an amount equal to the amount by which (A) the Actual Closing Date
Working Capital Amount exceeds (B) the Baseline Working Capital Amount. Such
payment shall be payable by Buyer to Seller in accordance with written
instructions to be provided by the Sellers Representative to Buyer no less
than two (2) business days after the determination thereof. Such payment shall
be made by Buyer to Seller in cash, by cashiers or certified check, or by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in United States Dollars to the
accounts designated by Seller pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

(ii) If the Actual Closing Date Working Capital Amount is less than the
Baseline Working Capital Amount, Buyer shall be entitled to receive an amount
by which (A) the Baseline Working Capital Amount exceeds (B) the Actual
Closing Date Working Capital Amount. Buyer shall be permitted to withdraw
such amount from the Escrow Account maintained with respect to Seller and the
Sellers Representative shall cooperate in providing the joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent with respect thereto.



 

7 (iii) If, pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_ above, a dispute exists as to the
final determination of the Actual Closing Date Working Capital Amount, Buyer,
on one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall promptly pay to the other,
as appropriate in accordance with _Sections 1.6(c)(i)_ and _1.6(c)(ii)_ , such
amounts as are not in dispute, pending final determination of such dispute
pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_.

1.7. _Joinder of Certain Stockholders_. Prior to the Closing, Stockholders
will use reasonable efforts to cause the Joinder Parties to join this
Agreement as described in _Section 4.1(r)_. For the avoidance of doubt, this
Agreement will be binding upon and enforceable against the parties who have
signed this Agreement whether or not any or all of the Joinder Parties sign;
provided, as set forth in _Section 4.1(r)_, Buyer shall not be required to
close unless all of the Stockholders shall sign this Agreement (including
through the Joinder Agreement).

1.8. _Allocation_. The parties shall cooperate to prepare an allocation of
the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law, as appropriate) (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). The
parties agree that the Purchase Price Allocation will bind them for federal,
state, local, and foreign income tax purposes in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder and will be consistently reflected by them
on any tax returns or reports they file or prepare. The parties shall consult
with each other concerning all issues relating to such allocation in
connection with any tax audit and the parties shall not initiate any
positions inconsistent with such allocation in connection with any tax audit.
Notwithstanding the above, the parties agree to determine the portion of the
Purchase Price to be allocated to any United States Real Property Interests
(as defined in Section 897(c) of the Code and the underlying Treasury
Regulations) prior to the Closing. Furthermore, the parties hereto agree that
of the total Purchase Price, $3,000,000 is being paid for the purchase of the
tangible personal property of Seller in California (including furniture,
machinery, tools, equipment and other tangible fixed assets of Seller, but
excluding inventory items) and the software property of Seller in California,
and the remainder of the Purchase Price is being paid for all other assets of
Seller, including intangible assets such as goodwill, customer base, trained
workforce, patents, copyrights, franchise rights and other aspects of a
going concern value.

Person in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and

in a proceeding at law or in equity.

 

(d) _Conflicts; Consents_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby nor
compliance by the Seller with any of the provisions hereof will: (i) conflict
with or result in a breach of the charter, by-laws or other constitutive
documents of Seller, (ii) conflict with or result in a default (or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under any of
the provisions of any agreement binding upon the Seller, including any
contract identified on the Material Contract List referred to in _Section
2.1(l)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, which would adversely affect the ability
of the Seller to perform its duties and obligations under this Agreement, or
which would have a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) violate any law, statute,
rule or regulation or order, writ, injunction or decree applicable to Seller
or its properties or assets which would adversely affect the ability of the
Seller to perform its duties and obligations under this Agreement, or which

each of the calendar years 2010, 2009 and 2008 and (ii) the amount for which
each such customer was invoiced during each such periods; provided that for

and the Seller Parties shall have no further obligation or liabilities under

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Parties and their

(c) A party seeking indemnification under _Article V_ of this Agreement shall
be referred to as an " _Indemnified Party_ " and a party from whom the
indemnification is sought under _Article V_ of this Agreement shall be
referred to as an " _Indemnifying Party_ ". No Indemnified Party will seek
indemnification under  _Section 5.1(a)(i) or (v)_ or _Section 5.1(b)(i)_,
as the case may be, until the date on which all unreimbursed claims by parties
entitled to indemnification under _Section 5.1(a)(i) and (v)_, on the one
hand, or  _Section 5.1(b)(i)_, on the other hand, exceed $1,100,000 in the
aggregate (such amount, the " _Deductible Amount_ "), in which case the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnity only for the amount of
its Damages exceeding the Deductible Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
an Indemnified Party may immediately seek reimbursement for the full amount of
any Damages (i.e., without

 



 

40  having to satisfy the Deductible Amount) for (i) claims under _Section
5.1(a)(i)_ arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in _Sections 2.1(a)_ ,  _2.1(e)_ , _2.1(i)_ , _2.1(n)(ii)-(xi)_ ,
and _2.1(o)(ii)-(vii)_ (the " _Core Representations_ "), (ii) claims arising
out of or relating to fraud or willful misconduct and (iii) claims under 
_Section 5.1(a)(iv)_. The aggregate liability of either Buyer, on the one
hand, or the Seller Parties, on the other hand, for indemnification under
_Section 5.1(a)(i), (v) and (vi)_ or _Section 5.1(b)(i)_, as the case may
be, shall not exceed the aggregate of the Escrow Amount, except that claims
arising out of a breach of the Core Representations shall not be subject to
the Escrow Amount cap. For any breach of the representations and
warranties contained in _Sections 2.1(i)_ , _2.1(n)(ii)-(xi)_ , and
_2.1(o)(ii)-(vii)_ (collectively, the " _Special Representations_ "), the
Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to receive indemnification for all
Damages for any and all breaches up to a maximum aggregate liability of the
Seller Parties equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price. For any
breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 2.1(a)_
and _2.1(e)_  (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), the
Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to receive indemnification for all Damages
for any and all breaches up to a maximum aggregate liability of the Seller
Parties equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Purchase Price. The
maximum aggregate liability of the Seller Parties under _Section 5.1(a)_
shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the Purchase Price.

 

(d) To the extent an indemnification claim arises under this _Article V_ as a
result of a third-party claim against an Indemnified Party, the Damages shall
be deemed to include incidental, consequential, special, indirect, enhanced
and punitive damages to the extent claimed by a third party against an
Indemnified Party.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any claim for indemnity pursuant to _Sections
5.1(a)(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ and  _(vi)_ through _(x)_ shall not be
subject to the Deductible Amount limitation set forth in _Section 5.1(c)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary (including
without limitation the Seller Parties failure to disclose any matter
required to be disclosed on any Disclosure Schedule required hereunder), the
parties agree that (1) no representation or warranty of the Seller Parties
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be untrue or incorrect, and
the Seller Parties shall not be deemed to be in breach thereof, and no Buyer
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to any
such breach, and (2) no indemnification obligation shall be triggered under 
_Section 5.1(a)(v)_, if in either case Buyer, its affiliates or any of their
respective employees had actual knowledge with respect to any such undisclosed
matter or that any representation or warranty was untrue or incorrect, but
only if such knowledge was obtained by such Person pursuant to information or
data contained in any report, written analysis or other documentation prepared
for or at the request of Buyer (or its affiliates) by Deloitte or any other
third-party consultant or advisor (excluding Buyers outside legal counsel,
Reed Smith) in connection with Buyers due diligence investigation relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.2. _Procedures for Indemnification_.

 

(a) If an Indemnified Party shall claim to have suffered Damages for which
indemnification is available under _Section 5.1(a)_ or _5.1(b)_ , as the
case may be (for purposes of



 

41  this _Section 5.2_, regardless of whether such Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive a payment in respect of such claim by virtue of _Section
5.1(c)_), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of such claim as promptly as practicable, which written notice shall
describe the nature of such claim in reasonable detail, the facts and
circumstances that give rise to such claim and the amount of such claim if
reasonably ascertainable at the time such claim is made (or if not then
reasonably ascertainable, the maximum amount of such claim reasonably
estimated by the Indemnified Party); provided, that the failure by the
Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice.
In the case of a claim by a Buyer Indemnitee, such written notice shall be
provided by the Indemnified Party to the Sellers Representative, with a copy
provided to the Escrow Agent. In the event that within thirty (30) days after
the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such a written notice from the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall not have received from the
Indemnifying Party a written objection to such claim, such claim shall be
conclusively presumed and considered to have been assented to and approved by
the Indemnifying Party following receipt by the Indemnifying Party (and, in
the case of a claim by a Buyer Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent) of a
written notice from the Indemnified Party to such effect.

(b) If within the thirty (30) day period described in paragraph (a) above the
Indemnified Party (and, in the case of claim by a Buyer Indemnitee, the Escrow
Agent) shall have received from the Indemnifying Party a written notice
setting forth the Indemnifying Partys objections to such claim and
the Indemnifying Partys reasons for such objection, then Buyer and the
Sellers Representative shall negotiate in good faith for a period of ten (10)
Business Days from the date the Indemnified Party receives such objection
(such period is hereinafter referred to as the " _Negotiation Period_ ").
After the Negotiation Period, if Buyer and Sellers Representative still
cannot agree on the claim, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall follow
the procedures set forth in _Section 8.9_ below with respect to the
resolution of such matter.

(c) Upon determination of the amount of a claim that is binding on both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the amount of such claim shall
be paid within ten (10) business days of the date such amount is determined.
If the Indemnifying Party responsible for payment of such claim is Buyer,
such payment shall be made by wire transfer to Seller. If the Indemnifying
Party responsible for payment of such claim is Seller, such payment shall be
made in accordance with this _Article V_ including  _Section 5.5 _below.

5.3. _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this _Article V_
in respect of any legal proceeding, action, claim or demand instituted by a
third Person (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall give the Indemnifying Party
from whom indemnification with respect to such claim is sought (i) prompt
written notice (but in no event more than fifteen (15) days after the
Indemnified Party acquires knowledge thereof) of such Third Party Claim and
(ii) copies of all documents and information relating to any such Third Party
Claim within fifteen (15) days of their being obtained by the Indemnified
Party; provided, that the failure by the Indemnified Party to so notify or
provide copies to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such
Third Party Claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give
such notice or provide such copies.

 



 

42 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days (or such lesser time as
may be necessary to comply with statutory response requirements for
litigation claims that are included in any Third Party Claim) from receipt of
the notice contemplated in _Section 5.3(a)_ to notify the Indemnified Party
whether or not the Indemnifying Party will, at its sole cost and expense,
defend the Indemnified Party against such claim. If the Indemnifying Party
timely gives notice that it intends to defend the Third Party Claim, it shall
have the right, except as hereafter provided, to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with the Third Party Claim and to be represented by
counsel of its own choice, and the Indemnified Party will not admit any
liability with respect thereto or settle, compromise, pay or discharge the
same without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, so long as the Indemnifying Party is
contesting or defending the same with reasonable diligence and in good
faith; provided, that the Indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding
with counsel of its choice and at its expense; provided further, that the
Indemnifying Party may not enter into a settlement of any such Third Party
Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall be
not unreasonably withheld, unless such settlement requires no more than a
monetary payment for which the Indemnified Party is fully indemnified by the
Indemnifying Party or involves other matters not binding upon the Indemnified
Party; and provided further that, in the event the Indemnifying Party does not
agree in writing to accept the defense of, and assume all responsibility for,
such Third Party Claim as provided above in this  _Section 5.3(b)_, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with the Third Party Claim in such manner as the Indemnified
Party deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, and the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification therefor from the Indemnifying Party to
the extent provided under this _Article V_.

 

5.4. _Insurance; Other Indemnity_. The amount of any claim by an Indemnified
Party for indemnification pursuant to this _Article V_ shall be computed net
of (a) insurance proceeds received by such Indemnified Party on account of
such claim and (b) aggregate amounts covered or reasonably recoverable under
any indemnity agreement, contribution agreement, or other contract between an
Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and any third party, on the other hand.

5.5. _Escrow; Release of Escrow Amounts_. For a period of two (2) years
beginning on the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Period_ "), the Escrow Amount
shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. To the
extent that indemnification claims, if any, become payable by Seller Parties
under the provisions of _Section 5.1_ of this Agreement, the parties will
satisfy those claims using the Escrow Amount. Upon expiration of the Escrow
Period, any Escrow Amount which remains in said escrow and is not subject to
an outstanding claim made prior to such expiration by Buyer shall be released
by the Escrow Agent to Seller pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

 

5.6. _Adjustments_. Any indemnification payments made under this _Article V_
shall be considered an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

5.7. _Remedies_. The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy for the matters set forth in _Article V_ , and no party
shall have any cause of



 

43  action or remedy at law or in equity for breach of contract, rescission,
tort or otherwise against any other party arising under or in connection with
this Agreement, except in the case of fraud, and except with respect to
claims under _Section 3.6_ and _Section 6.1_ through _Section 6.4_, in
which case each of the parties shall each have and retain all other rights and
remedies existing in their favor at law or equity, including without
limitation, any rights for specific performance and/or injunctive or other
equitable relief.

5.8.  _Mitigation_. Buyer agrees that in the event of any breach giving rise
to an indemnification obligation of the Seller Parties hereunder, Buyer shall
take, or cooperate with Seller Parties, if so requested by the Sellers
Representative, in order to take, all reasonable measures to mitigate the
consequences of the related breach (including taking steps to prevent any
contingent liability from becoming an actual liability).

 

ARTICLE VI

 

 _POST CLOSING COVENANTS_

 

6.1. _Restrictions on Competition_. The Seller and each Stockholder identified
on _Schedule 6.1_ hereto covenants and agrees that during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and for a period of five (5) years following
the Closing Date (except as otherwise set forth in such _Schedule 6.1_ ), such
Seller Party shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, either
directly or indirectly undertake or carry on or be engaged or have any
financial or other interest in, or in any other manner advise or assist any
Person engaged in, any business involving the provision of products or
services which are the same as, similar to or in competition with the
business of Buyer and its affiliates in the United States of America or in any
other country in which Buyer or its affiliates presently conduct or have
conducted business at any time during the last two (2) years immediately
prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the applicable period

Mate and Shannon Edwards Honarvar shall be a five (5) year period.

6.2. _Non-Solicitation of Customers_. The Seller and each Stockholder
identified on _Schedule 6.2_  hereto covenants and agrees that for five (5)
years following the Closing Date (except as otherwise set forth in such
_Schedule 6.2_ ), such Seller Party shall not, and shall cause its affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, solicit the trade of, or trade with, any
customers or prospective customers of Buyer or its affiliates. For the

not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or
induce, any employee of Buyer or its affiliates to leave for any reason
whatsoever; provided that general advertisements for employment not
specifically targeting employees of Buyer or its affiliates shall not be
deemed to violate this _Section 6.3_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
applicable period under this _Section 6.3_ for Don Edwards, Phillip
Robbibaro, Stasia Edwards Mate and Shannon Edwards Honarvar shall be a five
(5) year period.



 

44 6.4. _Authorization to Modify Restrictions_. It is the intention of the
parties that the provisions of _Sections 6.1_ , _6.2_ and _6.3_ shall be
enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, but that
the unenforceability (or modification to conform to such law) of any provision
or provisions hereof shall not render unenforceable, or impair, the remaining
provisions of this Agreement. If any provision or provisions of such sections
shall be deemed illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable, either in whole
or in part, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to delete or modify, as
necessary, the offending provision or provisions and to alter the bounds
thereof to render it valid and enforceable.

 

6.5.  _50 th Anniversary Celebration_. Buyer agrees to honor the General
Monitors brand and its 50th Anniversary by holding a proper
celebration commensurate with such milestone on or before February 1, 2012
and to maintain the intrinsic value of the General Monitors brand at least
through such date.

 

6.6. _Employees_. During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending
on the sixty-first (61st) day following the Closing Date, Buyer shall employ
each of the current employees of Seller and provide each current employee who
remains employed with Buyer with benefits for at least one year following the
Closing Date that are the same as, or as to each employee substantially
comparable to, the position, compensation and employee benefits, plans and
programs (including, but not limited to, life insurance, welfare, profit
sharing, 401(k), severance, salary continuation and fringe benefits) currently
provided by Seller. Immediately following the execution of this Agreement,
Seller shall notify Sellers employees of their termination of employment
effective upon the Closing Date and Buyer shall notify such employees that
same will be immediately rehired by Buyer effective upon the Closing Date,
with continued uninterrupted participation in prior benefit plans except to
the extent not possible pursuant to applicable law or reasons beyond the
control of Buyer. Following the Closing, Buyer shall take all commercially
reasonable steps necessary to, (a) waive limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods to the extent such conditions,
exclusions, and waiting periods have been satisfied under the employee
benefit plans with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the employees of the Seller under any welfare plan that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, (b)
provide each employee of the Seller with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, (c) provide
each employee of the Seller with service credit for purposes of eligibility
and vesting under any medical, dental, life insurance, disability,
supplemental employment and other welfare plan of Buyer in which such employee
is entitled to participate and for purposes of vacations and other leave
programs; _provided_ , that in no event will service credit for periods prior
to Closing be used for purposes of calculating 401(k) or retirement benefits
or for determining eligibility for retirement benefits, unless otherwise
specified in any such plan. As of the Closing Date, all medical, dental, life
insurance, disability, supplemental unemployment, and other welfare plan
expenses and benefits with respect to claims incurred by any employee of the
Seller or his or her covered dependents prior to, on, or after the Closing
Date shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer. Seller agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to have benefit plans transferred with
existing funding arrangements and service agreements and to prevent loans from
defaulting. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the parties agree to
use commercially reasonable efforts, and cooperate in good faith, to reach a
mutually and reasonably acceptable resolution



 

45  (the " _Benefit Plan Resolution_ ") with respect to the 401(k), medical and
other welfare benefit plans covering employees of the Seller (including
without limitation potentially having any and all rights, obligations, and
responsibilities under such plans and the related funding arrangements and
service agreements assumed by Buyer, or such other resolution which is
mutually and reasonably acceptable to the parties).

6.7. _COBRA_. Buyer shall be responsible for the continuation of health plan
coverage, in accordance with the requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ ") and Sections 601
through 608 of ERISA, for any employee of Seller, or qualified beneficiary
under a group health plan covering employees of Seller and/or their
dependents, who, prior to the Closing Date, is receiving or is entitled to
receive COBRA benefits or who loses health plan coverage in connection with
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

 

6.8. _Payment of Wages_. Seller shall be responsible for the payment of all
wages, vacation, and other compensation required to be paid to terminated
employees of Seller under applicable law due to employees with respect to
their service as employees through the close of business on the Closing Date,
including pro rata bonus payments to which such employees may be entitled. 

6.9. _Retirement Plan_. Seller shall take action to cease participation in the
General Monitors Savings For Retirement Plan effective as of the Closing.
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the plan
does not terminate as a result of the cessation of its participation and that
Buyer can assume the plan effective as of the Closing in such a manner as to
enable a seamless transition for participants and beneficiaries, by transfer
of all contracts for recordkeeping and investments either (x) to Buyer
directly or (y) first to another participating employer, provided that Buyer
will be permitted to adopt the Plan as a sponsor or participating employer.
Seller shall notify Buyer prior to Closing if the transfer of the plan to
Buyer as of the Closing pursuant to (x) or (y) above is not possible and in
that event Seller shall take action to terminate the Plan prior to Closing.

6.10. _Real Estate_. The parties shall cooperate in good faith with respect
to any real estate filings which must be made pursuant to the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement.

 

6.11. _Products Liability Coverage_. For a period of six (6) years following
the Closing Date, Buyer hereby agrees to maintain products liability
insurance coverage with respect to the products and services of the Seller and
Buyer (regardless of whether sold before or after the Closing) coverage upon
such terms, conditions, and levels as are at least equal to the
coverage historically maintained by the Seller under the policies listed on
_Schedule 6.10_ hereto.

6.12. _Access to Records_. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall retain for a
period consistent with Buyers record-retention policies and practices the
Acquired Records. Buyer also shall provide Seller and Stockholders and their
Representatives reasonable access thereto, during normal business hours and
on at least three days prior written notice, to enable them to prepare
financial statements or tax returns or deal with tax audits. After the Closing
Date, Seller shall provide Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to
Excluded Records, during normal business hours and on at least three days
prior written notice, for any reasonable business purpose specified by Buyer
in such notice.

will terminate, except that the obligations in _Sections 3.1_ and _3.6_ will
survive; and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto

authorized representatives for either Buyer or Sellers
Representative identified in _Exhibit A_ , the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to
any one or more of the executive officers of Buyer (" _Executive Officers_ ")
which shall include the titles of Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal
Officer, or Sellers Representative, as the case may be, as the Escrow Agent
may select. The Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be any such Executive Officer. The Escrow Agent and the
beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account
numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by Buyer or the Sellers
Representative to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiarys bank,
or (iii) an intermediary bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Escrow Agent
shall not be obligated to confirm any Funds Transfer Instructions or other
instructions or directions given in accordance with this Agreement and may
rely on any Funds Transfer Instructions given in writing or by telecopier
which the Escrow Agent believes in good faith to be signed by an authorized
signatory set forth on _Exhibit A_.

 

Section 2\. _Investment; Income Reporting_

 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall invest (and reinvest as appropriate), all funds
held in the Escrow Account as specifically directed in this Section 2\. The
Escrow Agent shall have no investment discretion over the Escrow Account. The
Escrow Agent shall invest all funds held into the Fidelity Institutional Money
Market Funds (Money Market/Prime Money Market (AAA)). Buyer and the Sellers
Representative instruct Escrow Agent to vote all proxies in accordance with
the proxy policy in effect from time to time for the Escrow Agent unless
otherwise specifically instructed by the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative. Buyer and the Sellers Representative specifically
acknowledge that Buyer and the Sellers Representative understand that this
provision may involve the Escrow Agents voting shares of mutual funds that
pay fees to the Escrow Agent or its affiliates and that, in voting such
shares, the Escrow Agent may be in a position to vote to change fees paid at
the mutual fund level to itself or to an affiliate.

  

 

\- 3 - (b) The Escrow Account will be invested in investments, including without
limitation, shares of mutual funds, which are not insured by the FDIC, are
not deposits of or guaranteed by the Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates and
are subject to investment risks, including the loss of principal. In addition,
shares of money market mutual funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by any
Governmental Authority and there can be no assurance that a money market
mutual fund will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per
share.

 

(c) The parties recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent will not provide
supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of
moneys held in the Escrow Account or the purchase, sale, retention or other
disposition of any investment described herein. The Escrow Agent in its
capacity as escrow agent hereunder shall have no liability for any loss
sustained as a result of (i) any investment made pursuant to the instructions
of the parties hereto; (ii) the liquidation of any investment; (iii) the
failure of the parties to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest or
reinvest the Escrow Account or any earnings thereon; or (iv) any investment
held by the Escrow Agent in the event the parties fail to give investment
instructions.

 

(d) No investment shall mature after the conclusion of the Escrow Release Date
(as defined below). Interest and other income, dividends and earnings ("
_Escrow Earnings_ ") on investments described herein shall be added to the
sub-Escrow Account. Any loss or expense incurred as a result of an investment
will be borne by the sub-Escrow Account and the Escrow Agent shall in no
event be liable for any loss or expense incurred as a result of an investment
made in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(e) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of
investments through the facilities of its own trading or capital markets
operations or those of any affiliated entity. The Escrow Agent shall send
statements to each of the parties hereto on a monthly basis reflecting
activity in the Escrow Account for the preceding month, which statement shall
include without limitation information regarding any deposits and
disbursements in each sub-Escrow Account and a separate statement reflecting
the investment detail, including the balance, purchases, sales, and interest
postings of each sub-Escrow Account. Although Buyer and Sellers
Representative each recognizes that it may obtain a broker confirmation or
written statement containing comparable information at no additional cost,
both parties hereby agree that confirmations of investments are not required
to be issued by the Escrow Agent for each month in which a monthly statement
is rendered. However, no statement need be rendered for the Escrow Account if
no activity occurred for such month.

 

(f) Buyer and the Sellers Representative acknowledge and agree that the
delivery of the escrowed property is subject to the sale and final settlement
of investments described herein. Proceeds of a sale of investments will be
delivered on the business day on which the appropriate instructions are
delivered to the Escrow Agent if received prior to the deadline for same day
sale of such investments. If such instructions are received after the
applicable deadline, proceeds will be delivered on the next succeeding
business day.



 

\- 4 - (g) For purposes of (i) allocating _pro rata_ among the Sellers, in
accordance with their percentage interests as set forth on _Exhibit B_ ,
Escrow Earnings with respect to such Sellers applicable sub-Escrow Account,
if any, and (ii) IRS information reporting, if required, the Escrow Agent is
authorized and directed to report all Escrow Earnings, if any, earned in
respect of the Escrow Account in accordance with the IRS Forms W-9 provided to
the Escrow Agent by the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers, with
such reporting to be made by the Escrow Agent _pro rata_ based on the
respective percentage interests of the Sellers as set forth on _Exhibit B_ (as
such _Exhibit B_ shall be updated or amended from time to time) with respect
to such Sellers applicable sub-Escrow Account.

Section 3\. _Disbursement of Escrow Account_

 

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) below, the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized and directed to disburse to the Sellers all of the funds in the
sub-Escrow Accounts, plus the income or interest earned thereon, if any, less
an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Outstanding Claim Amounts, on [two
years from closing date], 2012 (the " _Escrow Release Date_ ") pursuant to
written instructions from Sellers Representative which may be in the form of
an excel spreadsheet (in a format acceptable to the Escrow Agent) that shall
include each Sellers name, address, taxpayer identification number, payment
instruction and payment amount that indicates the disbursement amount for each
Seller from each sub-Escrow Account. Disbursements pursuant to this Section 3
shall be made promptly (and in any event within five (5) business days)
following the Escrow Release Date. For purposes of this Agreement, an "
_Outstanding Claim Amount_ " means the aggregate amount of Damages (as defined
in the applicable Purchase Agreement under which such Claim is being sought)
which is set forth in a Claim (as defined below) delivered to the Escrow Agent
and the Sellers Representative prior to the Escrow Release Date and with
respect to which and to the extent that it remains unresolved and
no distribution has been made prior to the Escrow Release Date pursuant to
this Section 3\. Outstanding Claim Amounts shall be distributed to the Sellers
and/or to Buyer, as is appropriate, upon the final resolution of such
Outstanding Claim Amounts (notwithstanding that such final resolution shall
not have occurred until after the Escrow Release Date) as evidenced by (A)
joint written instructions from the Sellers Representative and Buyer as to
the disposition of the Outstanding Claim Amount or (B) an order of a court
having jurisdiction over the matter which is final and not subject to further
court proceedings or appeal (which shall also be sent to Buyer and Sellers
Representative, as applicable, by the party providing such final,
nonappealable order to the Escrow Agent); _provided_ , _however_ , that any
Outstanding Claim Amounts which may be finally resolved in favor of the
Sellers prior to the Escrow Release Date shall not give rise to any
distribution to the Sellers or the Sellers Representative prior to the Escrow
Release Date. Upon receipt of any such instructions or order, the Escrow Agent
shall disburse an amount of funds equal to the Outstanding Claim Amount
in accordance therewith, provided that the Escrow Agent shall at all times
hold funds in the applicable sub-Escrow Account which are sufficient to cover
the aggregate amount of all then Outstanding Claim Amounts held against such
sub-Escrow Account, or if the amount of funds is not then sufficient to cover
the aggregate amount of all then Outstanding Claim Amounts held against the
applicable sub-Escrow Account, the entire balance of such sub-Escrow Account.

 



 

\- 5 - (b) From time to time prior to the Escrow Release Date, subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations set forth in the applicable Purchase Agreement,
Buyer may deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice (a " _Claim_ ")
requesting disbursement to Buyer of a specified amount of funds in full or
partial payment of (i) (x) a Claim under Section 1.4(c)(ii) or (iii) of the
GMT Purchase Agreement (working capital adjustment provisions), (y) a Claim
under Section 1.6(c)(ii) or (iii) of the GMI Purchase Agreement (working
capital adjustment provisions), or (z) a Claim under Section 1.4(c)(ii) or
(iii) of the GMIL Purchase Agreement (working capital adjustment provisions);
or (ii) an indemnification obligation of the Sellers to a Buyer Indemnitee
(as defined in the applicable Purchase Agreement under which such a Claim is
being sought) for Damages (as defined in the applicable Purchase Agreement
under which such a Claim is being sought) in respect of which such Buyer
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 5.1(a) of such
Purchase Agreement (other than any Minority Purchase Agreement), and Section
3.1(a) of the applicable Minority Purchase Agreement (any of which shall be
referred to herein as a " _Claim Amount_ "), along with a delivery receipt or
other appropriate proof of delivery to the Sellers Representative of any
Claim. In order to be validly asserted, each such Claim shall specify in
reasonable detail the facts upon which the Claim is based, the section(s) of
the applicable Purchase Agreement with respect to which indemnification is
claimed, the appropriate sub-Escrow Account from which the Buyer alleges a
right to have the Claim paid, and the Claim Amount, or if a Claim Amount is
not finally quantified, a reasonable, good faith estimate of such Claim Amount
(a copy of which shall be provided to Sellers Representative at the same time
it is provided to the Escrow Agent). For the avoidance of doubt, each Claim
and Claim Amount shall apply only to the sub-Escrow Account specified in the
written notice provided by Buyer and such Claim or Claim Amount shall not
affect any other sub-Escrow Account established herein; provided that
Claims under the indemnities for [insert Big Branch Mine indemnity sections]
may be made without regard to sub-Accounts. If a Claim Amount is finally
quantified, and if the Escrow Agent is not in receipt of a written objection
from the Sellers Representative to such Claim within thirty (30) days
following the date of the Escrow Agents receipt of such Claim (a copy of
which shall be provided to Buyer by the Sellers Representative at the same
time it is provided to the Escrow Agent), then on the 31st day following such
receipt (or if the 31st day is not a business day for the Escrow Agent, then
on the first business day after the 31st day), the Escrow Agent shall
disburse to Buyer an amount of funds equal to the Claim Amount identified in
the Claim from the appropriate sub-Escrow Account referenced in the Claim.

 

(c) If the Escrow Agent is in receipt of a written objection, received within
thirty (30) days following the date of the Escrow Agents receipt of a Claim,
from the Sellers Representative (a copy of which shall be provided to Buyer)
to a Claim requesting a distribution of a Claim Amount, the Escrow Agent shall
not make the payment to Buyer of the Outstanding Claim Amount until such time
as it receives (A) joint written instructions from the Sellers Representative
and Buyer as to the disposition of the Outstanding Claim Amount or (B) an
order of a court having jurisdiction over the matter which is final and not
subject to further court proceedings or appeal. Upon receipt of any such
instructions or order, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the Outstanding Claim
Amount in accordance therewith.

 

(d) The following amounts shall be available for Claims (as defined below)
under this Agreement, plus any related Escrow Earnings: 



     | (i) | up to $19,630,400 for Claims under the GMI Purchase

(iv) above; (y) GMS, then 70% of any such Claim first shall be allocated to

above, and (z) Gassonic, then 69.832% of any such Claim first shall be

30.168% of any such Claim first shall be allocated to the maximum Claim amount
under subsection (vi) above. To the extent any allocation to subsections (iv),
(v) or (vi) above exhaust the amounts available thereunder, then any excess
Claim amount shall be allocated to and paid from the amounts set forth in

(e) In connection with any court order with respect to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive an opinion of counsel to the
presenting party to the effect that such order is final and nonappealable and
from a court of competent jurisdiction. The Escrow Agent shall act upon such
order and opinion without further question.

 

(f) Any disputes among Buyer and Sellers Representative with respect to the
release of funds in the Escrow Account shall be settled by the applicable

immunities: 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall act hereunder as an escrow agent only, and it shall
not be responsible or liable in any manner whatever for the sufficiency,
correctness,



 

\- 7 -  genuineness or validity of any document furnished to the Escrow Agent or any

has complied with its terms or is entitled to payment or to any other right or
remedy thereunder.

 

(b) The Escrow Agent may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon (and shall incur no liability for following the instructions
contained therein) any written notice, instruction or request furnished to it
hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall be under no
duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any
such document. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments
which may be due to be paid into the Escrow Account by any party.

 

(c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it
unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agents
gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of any loss. In
the administration of the Escrow Account hereunder, the Escrow Agent may
execute any of its powers and perform its duties hereunder directly
or through agents or attorneys and may consult with counsel, including in-
house counsel, accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and
retained by it and the fees of such persons shall be paid from the Escrow
Account, such payment applied to the sub-Escrow Accounts pro rata per dollar
value of such sub-Escrow Accounts measured at Closing. The Escrow Agent shall
not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or
other skilled persons, including in-house counsel.

and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, fines, penalties, and expenses,
including out-of-pocket and incidental expenses and legal fees and expenses ("
_Losses_ ") that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, the
Indemnititees or any of them (i) for following any instructions or other
directions upon which the Escrow Agent is authorized to rely pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement; or (ii) in connection with or arising out of the
Escrow Agents performance under this Agreement provided, with respect to this
clause (ii) only, the Indemnitees have not acted with gross negligence or
engaged in willful misconduct. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for
special, indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any
kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), and regardless of
the form of action. The provisions of this Section 4(d) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent for any reason.

 

(e) The Escrow Agent shall have no duties except those specifically set forth
in this Agreement and shall not be subject to, nor have any liability or
responsibility under, any other agreement or document the other parties hereto
may be parties to or responsible for, even if same is referenced herein or
copies have been given to the Escrow Agent.

court.

 

Section 5\. _Compensation._ The Escrow Agent shall be compensated for its
services (the " _Escrow Fee_ ") hereunder as detailed in a fee schedule

rata per dollar value of such sub-Escrow Accounts measured at Closing.

the event that any escrow property shall be attached, garnished or levied
upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined
by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or
entered by any court order affecting the property deposited under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole
discretion, to obey and comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or
issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding
upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and in the event that the
Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall
not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person, firm or
corporation, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or
decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

Form W-8 or Form W-9, as applicable.

days prior written notice to the other parties hereto. Similarly, the Escrow
Agent may be removed and replaced following the giving of thirty (30) days
prior written notice to the Escrow Agent by the other parties hereto. In
either event, the duties of the Escrow Agent shall terminate thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice (or as of such earlier date as may be mutually
agreeable); and the Escrow Agent shall then deliver the balance of the moneys
or assets then in its possession to a successor escrow agent as shall
be appointed by the other parties hereto as evidenced by a written notice
filed with the Escrow Agent.

(b) If the other parties hereto have failed to appoint a successor prior to
the expiration of thirty (30) days following receipt of the notice of

agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment

Dear Mr. Robbibaro:

We are very pleased that you have decided to [continue employment with

stockholder, director, employee or officer of, or consultant to such a
business while employed by the Company without first obtaining the prior
written approval of the President and CEO of MSA. Should you become a
promoter, substantial stockholder, director, employee or officer of, or a
consultant to a business organized for profit upon obtaining such prior
written approval, you understand that you have a continuing obligation to
advise the President and CEO of MSA at such time as any activity of either the

involved or hereafter become involved, on your own behalf or as an employee of
the Company, appear to present a possible conflict of interest under the
Company policy then in effect, you will promptly disclose the facts to the
President and CEO of MSA so that a determination can be made as to whether a
conflict of interest does exist. You will take whatever action is requested of
you by MSA to resolve any conflict which it finds to exist.

fiduciary duty owed by you to any former employer.

---|--- 



 

3  this Agreement shall provide you with the right to continued employment with
the Company. You agree to resign immediately from all official positions with
the Company and any of its affiliates upon termination of your employment for
any reason. 

---|--- 

(b) For Cause. If your employment is terminated by the Company for "cause,"
the Companys obligation under this Agreement will terminate immediately upon
notice by the Company and payment of the Accrued Amounts. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _cause_ " means (i) your conviction of, or plea of _nolo
contendere_ to, a felony; (ii) your engaging in an act or acts of dishonesty,
fraud, or gross misconduct which result or are intended to result in
damage to the Companys business or reputation; (iii) failure by you to
substantially perform your duties hereunder (other than due to disability)
which remains uncured for more than 10 days following your receipt of written
notice thereof from the Company; or (iv) any conduct on your part
contributing to, or any failure to correct deficiencies directly or indirectly
resulting in, financial restatements or irregularities. " _Accrued Amounts_ "
means (w) any unpaid base salary at the rate then in effect through the date
of termination and any accrued but unused vacation through the date of
termination; (x) any unpaid bonus earned with respect to any period ending on
or preceding the date of termination; (y) reimbursement for any unreimbursed
business expenses incurred through the date of termination; and (z) all other
payments or benefits to which you may be entitled under the terms of any
applicable compensation arrangement or benefit program or this Agreement;
_provided, further_ that Accrued Amounts shall not include any pro-rata or
other bonus amounts except as provided in subclause (x). Except to the extent
otherwise required by law, Accrued Amounts shall be paid as follows: Accrued
Amounts specified in subclause (w) shall be paid on the first regularly
scheduled payroll date following separation from service; Accrued Amounts
specified in subclause (x) shall be paid at the time and in the form provided
in the underlying bonus plan or arrangement; Accrued Amounts specified in
subclause (y) shall be paid as provided in the Companys expense reimbursement
policy and as provided in this Agreement; and Accrued Amounts specified

(c) Without Cause. If your employment is terminated by the Company without
cause, as your exclusive remedy, you shall (i) be paid the Accrued Amounts,
and a pro-rated annual bonus and pro-rated quarterly bonus for the year and



 

4  quarter in which your employment terminates (calculated using your target
bonus for such year and quarter, which shall be calculated presuming all
metrics are achieved at "target") (" _Pro-Rated Bonus_ "), upon the effective
date of your separation from service, with Accrued Amounts payable as provided
herein and the Pro-Rated Bonus payable on the first regularly scheduled
payroll date following the 30 day anniversary of your separation from
service, and (ii) continue to receive your then-current base salary together
with your annual bonus and your quarterly bonuses (calculated using your
target bonus for such year and quarters during such year and presuming all
metrics achieved at "target") (" _Continuation Pay_ ") payable in the usual
way through January 31, 2012 (the " _Salary Continuation Period_ "),
commencing on the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the 30 day
anniversary of your separation from service and will be subject to legally
required withholding; _provided_ , _however_ , if you are a "specified
employee" under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, (" _Section 409A_ ") then, to the extent (if any) that this Paragraph
7(c) provides for a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section
409A, no such deferred compensation shall be paid during the six-month period
following your separation from service and, to the extent otherwise payable
during such period, shall be aggregated and paid on the first business
day following the six-month anniversary of your separation from service. You
will also continue to receive the same level of medical and dental benefits as
are available to you at the time of your termination, at the Companys expense
under the COBRA program, for the duration of the Salary Continuation Period,
to the extent such benefits can be provided to you on a non-taxable basis. The
Companys obligation to make payments and provide benefits during the Salary
Continuation Period is contingent upon you first signing a general waiver and
release and the expiration of any associated revocation period within 30 days
following your separation from service, in a reasonable form presented by the
Company and your full compliance with all provisions in this Agreement
including, but not limited to, Sections 8 through 10\.

 

(d) Good Reason. If you resign your employment for "Good Reason" during the
term of this Agreement and not for voluntary termination as provided in
Section 7(e), as your exclusive remedy, you shall (i) be paid the Accrued
Amounts and the Pro-Rated Bonus, upon the effective date of your separation
from service, with Accrued Amounts payable as provided herein and the Pro-
Rated Bonus payable on the



 

5  first regularly scheduled payroll date following the 30 day anniversary of
your separation from service, and (ii) Continuation Pay payable in the usual
way through the Salary Continuation Period, commencing on the first regularly
scheduled payroll date following the 30 day anniversary of your separation
from service and will be subject to legally required withholding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if you are a "specified employee" under Section 409A then, to the
extent (if any) that this Paragraph 7(d) provides for a "deferral of
compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A, no such deferred
compensation shall be paid during the six-month period following your
separation from service and, to the extent otherwise payable during such
period, shall be aggregated and paid on the first business day following the
six-month anniversary of your separation from service. You will also continue
to receive the same level of medical and dental benefits as are available to
you at the time of your termination, at the Companys expense under the COBRA
program, for the duration of the Salary Continuation Period, to the
extent such benefits can be provided to you on a non-taxable basis. The
Companys obligation to make payments and provide benefits during the Salary
Continuation Period is contingent upon you first signing a general waiver and
release and the expiration of any associated revocation period within 30 days
following your separation from service, in a reasonable form presented by the
Company and your full compliance with all provisions in this Agreement
including, but not limited to, Sections 8 through 10\. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Good Reason_ " means: (A) any material adverse change in your
position, duties, or authority as contemplated by this Agreement and as
effective following acquisition of the Company by MSA; (B) a material
diminution in your annual base salary or target bonus percentage; (C) the
relocation of your principal place of employment to a location more than 35
miles from your principal place of employment upon the date of this
Agreement; or (D) a breach by the Company of a material provision of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that you must provide notice to the
Company of any such act or failure to act within 90 days of the initial
existence of such act or failure to act, and, if the Company remedies and
corrects such act or failure to act during the period of 30 days following
your notice, such act or failure to act shall not constitute "Good
Reason" under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the mere occurrence of the acquisition of the Company by MSA be deemed
to constitute Good Reason.

  

 

6 (e) Resignation without Good Reason. You may voluntarily terminate
your employment (i.e., without Good Reason) at any time and you agree to give
the Company thirty (30) days written notice of the termination of your
employment with the Company. Upon the effective date of such termination, the
Company shall pay to you the Accrued Amounts.

(f) Death. If you die during your employment with the Company, the
Company will pay your estate any Accrued Amounts and the Pro-Rated Bonus
within 30 days of your death.

(g) Disability. If, during the term of this Agreement, you become disabled
within the meaning of Section 409A, even with reasonable accommodations made
by the Company on your behalf, the Company shall have the right to terminate
your employment and this Agreement, in which event you shall be entitled to
(i) the Accrued Amounts and the Pro-Rated Bonus, upon the effective date of
your separation from service, with Accrued Amounts payable as provided herein
and the Pro-Rated Bonus payable on the first regularly scheduled payroll date
following the 30 day anniversary of your separation from service, and (ii)
your then-current base salary payable on regularly scheduled payroll dates for
a period of three (3) months following your separation from service.

severance or similar payments or benefits under any plan of the Company or
MSA, except as provided in this Section 7\.



   8. |

any kind, in any part of the world, which competes with any part of the
business of the Company, MSA or its affiliates, as such business is then
conducted. Ownership of less than 5% of the securities of any publicly traded
company will not violate this Section 8\. You recognize and acknowledge that
it is an essential part of the acquisition of the Company by MSA, for the
proper protection of the business of the Company and the integration of its
operations within MSA that you be restrained from competing against the
Company and MSA or from soliciting or inducing any employee of

the Company, use in other than the Companys business, nor disclose to anyone
within the Company who does not have a need-to-know, any technical or non-

to the business of the Company, except with the Companys written permission.

proprietary information of others. You further agree that upon termination of
your employment with the Company, all records and all proprietary information
of the Company including copies thereof in your possession, whether prepared
by you or others, shall be so identified and shall be surrendered to and left
with the Company. Further, you agree that all other property of whatsoever
kind or nature belonging to the Company shall also be left with the Company.

your employment and for as long thereafter as is reasonably necessary to
protect the Companys interests.

to the business or activities of the Company; provided that the foregoing does
not apply to an invention which qualifies fully as a nonassignable invention
under Section 2870 et seq. of the California Labor Code.  
---|--- 



   13. | _Assignment of Invention_. You agree that in connection with any
invention covered by Section 12, you shall, on request of the Company and at
its expense, promptly execute a specific assignment of title to the Company
and do anything else reasonably necessary to enable the Company to secure a
patent therefor in the United States and foreign countries. 
---|--- 
 



   14. | _No Prior Agreements_. Except as declared in Exhibit A (attached

from employment for any reason, you immediately shall return to the Company
all of its property including, without limitation, all documents (including

scope of your employment.  
---|--- 



   17. |

such investigation or review relates to events or occurrences that transpired
while you were employed by the Company. The Company shall reimburse you for
any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with your
performance of obligations pursuant to this Section, subject to the
reimbursement provisions of Section 6, and for any performance of your
obligations under this Section 17 which occurs following your separation from
employment, the Company shall compensate you at a reasonable rate for the
time actually you spend cooperating under this Section 17\.

---|---

which you are restricted from soliciting Company employees shall extend to the
anniversary date of the date of the trial court order or settlement requiring
such compliance.
