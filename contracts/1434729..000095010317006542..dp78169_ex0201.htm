Article II 
 THE MERGER

  



  

Section 2.1 _Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company with all its property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Charter and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time: (a) the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated
in the Merger to read in its entirety as set forth on Exhibit B
until thereafter further amended as provided therein and in accordance with
the DGCL, and (b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
and restated in the Merger to read in their entirety as set forth on Exhibit C
until thereafter further amended as provided therein and in accordance with
the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and the DGCL.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company and Merger
Sub shall file a Certificate of Merger as contemplated by the DGCL, together
with any required related certificates, filings or recordings with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as
the Company and Parent may agree upon and as is set forth in such Certificate
of Merger (such time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 2.4 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with  _Section 7.1_ , the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") shall occur as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the
second (2nd) Business Day) after all of the conditions set forth in _Article
VI_ shall have been satisfied or waived by the party entitled to the benefit
of the same (other than conditions which by their terms are required to be
satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions), or at such other time and on a date as agreed to by the
parties in writing (the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall take place
at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date, at the offices of
Baker Botts L.L.P., 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York or at such other
place and time as agreed to by the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject to
applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
and shall hold office until their respective

  



    

 19

 



    

successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal. The officers of
the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or
their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal._

  



  

Section 2.6 _Effect on Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Cancelled Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any
Company Stockholder, any holder of Merger Sub Common Stock or any other
Person, each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no securities of Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(b) _Effect on Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, any Company Stockholder, any holder of Merger Sub Common Stock or
any other Person:

  



  

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company Stockholders
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares)
shall automatically, and without any election on the part of the Company
Stockholders, be converted into and represent the right to receive, and will
be exchangeable for, 1.65 shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_
").

  



  

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any of its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, represent all Parent Shares) shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock (the " _Parent Surviving Corporation Shares_ ").

  



  

(iii) From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to _____Section 2.6(b)(i)_ , upon the conversion thereof, shall cease to be
outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or a
Book Entry Share shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor, any cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders of shares of Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with
this _____Article II_ upon the surrender of such Certificate or transfer of
Book Entry Shares in accordance with _____Section 2.7_.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any Company Stockholder, any holder of Merger
Sub Common Stock or any other Person, each outstanding share of Merger Sub
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
converted into and become a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-

  



    

 20

 



    

assessable shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock equal to the quotient
of (x) the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than
the Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the
number of outstanding shares of Merger Sub Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Such shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock,
together with the Parent Surviving Corporation Shares, shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as
of immediately following the Merger.

  



  

(d) _Changes to Stock_. If at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding Parent QVC Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall occur by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
split-up, exchange or readjustment of shares or any stock or extraordinary
cash dividend thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar
transaction or event affecting any class or series of stock (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction as a result of which Parent QVC Common
Stock will be converted or exchanged), the Merger Consideration, the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may
be, shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to provide the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock comparable economic effect to that contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

(e) _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
no appraisal rights shall be available to Company Stockholders in connection
with the Merger.

  



  

Section 2.7 _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares._

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select an institution
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger for the purpose of exchanging Certificates
and Book Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration (for the avoidance of
doubt, Parent's transfer agent as of the date hereof shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter
or shall have entered into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange
Agent, which agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and
obligations of the Exchange Agent consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent will make
available to the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, a number
of shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)(i)_ (such shares of Parent QVCA
Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record
(as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a Certificate (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or by
appropriate guarantee of delivery in the form customarily used in
transactions of this nature from a member of a national securities exchange, a
member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or a commercial bank
or trust company in the United States) for use in effecting delivery of
shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof, and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section
2.7(d)(i)_.

  



    

 21

 



    

Exchange of any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with
Parent's customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book
entry.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. Each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or compliance with
Parent's customary procedure with respect to the exchange of Book Entry
Shares, will be entitled to receive (i) the number of shares of Parent QVCA
Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)(i)_ , (ii) a
check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_ and (iii) any dividends or distributions with
respect to such shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)(i)_. Such Certificate shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Until
so surrendered, each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration and any dividends and other distributions in accordance
with _Section 2.7(b)_ and _Section 2.7(d)_ , and any cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional share of Parent QVCA Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 2.7(e)_.

  



  

(c) _Certificate Holder_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration
is to be paid to or registered in the name of a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to the payment or registration thereof that the
surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes
required as a result of such payment or registration in the name of a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

  



  

(d) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or non-
transferred Book Entry Shares until such Certificates are properly
surrendered or Book Entry Shares are properly transferred in accordance with
this _Section 2.7_. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without
interest thereon, to the record holder of the shares of Parent QVCA Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender or
transfer, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such
shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender or transfer and
not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent QVCA Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender or transfer. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock, all shares of
Parent QVCA Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled
to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

  



    

 22

 



    

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent QVCA Common
Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger. If any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional
share of Parent QVCA Common Stock as a result of the Merger, such holder of
Company Common Stock will instead receive cash in an amount based on the
aggregation and sale of all fractional shares by the Exchange Agent at
prevailing market prices on behalf of such holders (after taking into account
applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company). Any amounts payable
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to this _Section 2.7(e)_ will be
payable from the proceeds of the aggregation and sale of fractional shares by
the Exchange Agent as soon as practicable after the Merger is completed. No
such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other
rights in respect of any fractional share. The parties hereto acknowledge
that the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to this
_Section 2.7(e)_ is not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares.

  



  

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon conversion of any shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)(i)_ shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid
at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares formerly representing shares of
Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

  



  

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for the
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent QVCA Common Stock or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official to the extent required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book Entry Share has not been
surrendered or transferred in accordance with this _Section 2.7_ immediately
prior to such date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate or Book Entry Share would otherwise irrevocably escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  



    

 23

 



    

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in respect of
such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.7(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ , with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

  



  

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent (and any Affiliate thereof or any other
withholding agent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person, such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or under any applicable provisions of state, local or non-U.S.
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted under any Incentive Plan, whether vested or unvested
(each, a " _Company Option_ "), that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such Company
Option, be converted into an option (each, a " _Parent Option_ ") to purchase
a number of shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
number of whole shares) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise
price per share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, divided by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Any restrictions on the
exercise of any Parent Option shall continue in full force and effect and the
term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Parent
Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such
Parent Option; provided, however, that: (1) each Parent Option shall, in
accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to
reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect
to Parent QVCA Common Stock subsequent to the Effective Time; (2)
the compensation committee of Parent's board of directors shall succeed to
the authority and responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof with respect to each Parent Option; and (3) each Parent
Option shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent with those in
effect under Parent's equity compensation plan. The Parties
hereto acknowledge that the assumption of the Company Options pursuant to
this _Section 2.8(a)_

  



    

 24

 



    

is intended to comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulations section
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) so as to not result in the grant of a new stock right or
otherwise result in the loss of the applicable exemption from Section 409A of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (" _Section 409A_ ").

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right granted under
any Incentive Plan with respect to Company Common Stock, whether vested or
unvested (each, a " _Company SAR_ "), that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such
Company SAR, be converted into a stock appreciation right (each, a " _Parent
SAR_ ") with respect to a number of shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares) equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company SAR
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Company SAR
immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio. Any restrictions on the exercise of any Parent SAR shall
continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting
schedule and other provisions of such Parent SAR shall otherwise remain
unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Parent SAR; provided, however,
that: (1) each Parent SAR shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to
further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction with respect to Parent QVCA Common Stock subsequent to the
Effective Time; (2) the compensation committee of Parent's board of directors
shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof with respect to each Parent SAR; and
(3) each Parent SAR shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent
with those in effect under Parent's equity compensation plan. The
Parties hereto acknowledge that the assumption of the Company SARs pursuant
to this _Section 2.8(b)_ is intended to comply with the requirements of
Treasury Regulations section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) so as to not result in the
grant of a new stock right or otherwise result in the loss of the applicable
exemption from Section 409A.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units granted
under any Incentive Plan with respect to Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Company RSU_ ") that is subject to time-based vesting and that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of such Company RSU, be converted into an award of restricted stock
units (each, a " _Parent RSU_ ") with respect to a number of shares of Parent
QVCA Common Stock (rounded to the nearest number of whole shares) equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio. Any vesting conditions and restrictions on the receipt of any
Parent RSUs shall continue in full force and effect and the term, vesting
schedule and other provisions of such Parent RSUs shall otherwise remain
unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Parent RSUs; provided,
however, that: (1) each Parent RSU award shall, in accordance with its terms,
be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with

  



    

 25

 



    

respect to Parent QVCA Common Stock subsequent to the Effective Time; (2) the
compensation committee of Parent's board of directors shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof with respect to each Parent RSU award; and (3) each Parent
RSU award shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent with those
in effect under Parent's equity compensation plan. For clarity, any award of
deferred restricted stock units with respect to Company Common Stock, and any
amount deferred under a Company Plan that is denominated in Company Common
Stock, shall be treated as a Company RSU for all purposes under this
Agreement.

  



  

(d) At the Effective Time, each award of performance share units with
respect to Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company PSU_ ") that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of such Company PSU, be converted into an award of
performance share units (each, a " _Parent PSU_ ") with respect to a target
number of shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock (rounded to the nearest number
of whole shares) equal to the product of (i) the target number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Any vesting
conditions and restrictions on the receipt of any Parent PSUs shall continue
in full force and effect and the term, vesting schedule and other
provisions of such Parent PSUs shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result
of the assumption of such Parent PSUs; provided, however, that: (1) each
Parent PSU award shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further
adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision
of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction with respect to Parent QVCA Common Stock subsequent to the
Effective Time; (2) the compensation committee of Parent's board of directors
shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof with respect to each Parent PSU award;
and (3) each Parent PSU award shall be subject to administrative procedures
consistent with those in effect under Parent's equity compensation plan.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if,
from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time
or (ii) any termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ ,
the outstanding shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock or Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, then the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the
case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the
holders of Company Common Stock (including Company Options exercisable for
Company Common Stock, Company SARs exercisable with respect to Company Common
Stock, Company RSUs and Company PSUs) the same economic effect as

respects with the requirements of the Sarbanes Act, the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act (to the extent then applicable) and (ii)did not contain any

case, any related notes thereto) contained in or incorporated by reference in

most recently completed assessment of Parent's internal controls over

Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any material "off-
balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of
the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

the date hereof, there has been no event or condition which has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (b) the

Sub nor any QVC Group Subsidiary (or any of its or their respective properties

to Parent or QVC, Inc. or any of its Subsidiaries which Parent Plan is
material to the QVC Group taken as a whole, subject to applicable Law, Parent
has made available to the Company a copy of such plan and all material
amendments thereto. No action, suit, investigation, audit, proceeding or
claim (other than routine claims for benefits) is pending against or involves
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, is threatened against or threatened to
involve, any Parent Plan before any Governmental Authority that, individually
or in the aggregate, if determined or resolved adversely in accordance with
the plaintiff's demands would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No QVC Group Subsidiary is
a party to or subject to, or is currently negotiating in connection with

confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement
to or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of

determines

  



    

 61

 



    

in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a

including a standstill provision with respect to such Person or group, that
are customary for confidentiality agreements executed in similar
circumstances and (y) provides prior written notice to Parent in accordance
with  _ ___ _Section 5.2(c)_ ; and

  



  

(ii)  Following any discussions regarding, and the execution of,
the confidentiality agreement referenced in the foregoing _clause __(i)_ ,
engage in further discussions or negotiations with such Person or group (and
their Representatives) with respect to such Alternative Company Transaction
Proposal.

  



  

(c)   _Notification_. In addition to the obligations of the
Company set forth in _Sections  5.2(a)_, _(b)_ and _(d)_ hereof, as promptly

group of Persons making such Alternative Company Transaction Proposal,
inquiry or request. In addition, the Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably
currently informed of the status of, the written or material oral
communications regarding, and the material terms and conditions of, such
Alternative Company Transaction Proposal, inquiry or request, and any related
discussions or negotiations, and (ii) provide Parent promptly (and in any
event within forty-eight (48) hours) with all material non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is made available to
the Person or group of Persons making such Alternative Company Transaction
Proposal (or any of their Representatives) which was not previously made
available to Parent or its Representatives.

of the Company nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i)

under the Exchange Act (it being understood and agreed that the Company's
Board of Directors and the Special Committee may take no position with
respect to an Alternative Company Transaction Proposal that is a tender offer
or exchange offer during the period referred to in this clause) or (D) other
than with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, fail to publicly
reaffirm its approval or recommendation of this Agreement within five (5)
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing if an Alternative Company
Transaction Proposal or any material modification thereto shall have been made
publicly or sent or given to the Company Stockholders (or any Person or Group
of Persons shall have publicly announced an intention, whether or not
conditional, to make an Alternative Company Transaction Proposal) (any action
described in this _clause (i)_ being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) except as expressly provided herein, approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow the

understanding (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") (A) constituting, or
providing for, any Alternative Company Transaction Proposal or (B) requiring
it (or that would require it) to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.2_ or
in any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may,
subject to compliance with _Section 5.2(e)_ , solely in response to either
(x) a Company Intervening Event or (y) a Superior Company Proposal, make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, solely in response to an
Alternative Company Transaction Proposal, terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ in order to enter concurrently into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Company Proposal, if in
either case the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
after consultation with the Special Committee and its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(e)  The Company shall not make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ in order to enter concurrently into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Superior Company Proposal unless (i) the Company shall have
first (A) provided to Parent four (4) Business Days' prior written
notice (the " _Company Notice Period_ "), which notice shall state expressly
(1) that it has received a Superior Company Proposal or that there has been a
Company Intervening Event, (2) in the case of a Superior Company Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Company Proposal (including the
per share value of the consideration offered therein and the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making the Superior Company Proposal), and that the
Company shall have provided to Parent prior to or contemporaneously with the
delivery of such notice a copy of the relevant material proposed transaction
agreements with the Person or group of Persons making such Superior Company
Proposal and other material documents (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment (or subsequent amendment) to the financial terms, including but
not limited to the proposed purchase price, or to any other material term of
such

  



    

 63

 



    

Superior Company Proposal shall each require the Company to provide a new
notice to Parent in accordance with this _clause (e)_, provided that the
Company Notice Period in connection with any such new notice shall be three
(3) Business Days (the " _Amended Company Notice Period_ ")) and (4) that it
intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and (B)

Agreement, during the Company Notice Period or the Amended Company Notice
Period, as applicable, to the extent requested by Parent, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Parent during such Company Notice Period or Amended
Company Notice Period, as applicable, to amend this Agreement, and has
considered in good faith any bona fide offer (a " _Parent Offer_ ") by Parent
to the Company, and, after such negotiations and good faith consideration of
such Parent Offer, if any, the Board of Directors of the Company again makes
the determination described in the last sentence of _Section 5.2(d)_ (it
being understood that the delivery of the notification contemplated by this
_Section 5.2(e)_ shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change) and (ii) the Company shall have complied with this
_Section 5.2_ in all material respects.

  



  

(f)   _Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer
or exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure to
stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or an Alternative Company Transaction Proposal or (ii) making any "stop look
and listen" or similar communication to its stockholders of the nature
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, provided that, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, in no event shall the Company or its
Board of Directors take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited
by this _Section 5.2_ , except as provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt,
if any disclosure or other action pursuant to _clause (i)_ of this _Section
5.2(f)_ includes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, it shall be deemed
to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change for all purposes under this
Agreement.

entitled to have its Representatives present at all times during any such
inspection. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or information
provided, made available or delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ or

Effective Time, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.4 for

_however_ , that, in connection with any such approvals, consents, exemptions
or waivers from third parties (excluding Governmental Authorities), (x) the
parties hereto shall not be required to (and they shall not be required to
cause any of their Subsidiaries to) make any material payments or incur any
other material Liabilities (including becoming a guarantor of any Contract)
and (y) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall agree to make
any payments or incur any other Liabilities, or make or agree to make any
amendment to the terms of any applicable Contract, in order to obtain any such
consent, approval, authorization or waiver without the prior written consent
of Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that, except as expressly required by
this Agreement, no consent of any third party (excluding Governmental
Authorities) shall be a condition to the Closing pursuant to Article VI, (iv)

the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking
to have vacated or reversed any Order that would restrain, prevent or delay
the completion of the Merger and (v) the execution and delivery of any

Governmental Authority or any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

  



  

(b)   _Notification_. Each of the Company and Parent shall keep
the other party hereto reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating
to the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions

or with any Governmental Authority or other third party with respect to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) permit
the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the

contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) to the extent reasonably practical, not
participate in any meeting or teleconference with (A) any Governmental

Authority or other third party, as applicable, gives the other the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat, and (iv) furnish the other party hereto
with such

  



    

 68

 



    

necessary information and reasonable assistance as the Company or Parent, as
applicable, may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions of information to any such third party.

  



  

(c)   _No Divestitures_. In furtherance of the covenants set
forth in _Section 5.5(a)_ , if any objections are asserted with respect to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby under any domestic
or foreign antitrust or Competition Law or if any Action is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department
of Justice, the FCC or any other applicable Governmental Authority challenging
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or which
would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation of
the Merger, Parent shall take all reasonable actions necessary to resolve any
such objections or Actions (or threatened Actions) so as to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as soon as reasonably
practicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no case shall the Company or
Parent be obligated to (and the Company shall not, without the written
consent of Parent, and in no event shall Parent be deemed to have breached
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement solely for refusing to)
become subject to, consent to or agree to, or otherwise take any action with

sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict,
operate, invest or otherwise change its respective assets or business
(including that of its Affiliates (but for the avoidance of doubt excluding
any Specified Persons or Permitted Holders, as to whom no such requirements,

that, either individually or in the aggregate, (i), materially adversely
affects the financial condition, business, or the operations of (x) the
Company and its Subsidiaries or (y) the QVC Group Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis and post-Closing basis, or (ii) prohibits or materially
limits the ownership, control or operation by (x) the Company and its
Subsidiaries or (y) the QVC Group Subsidiaries of any material portion of its
or their respective businesses or assets, or compels the Company or Parent
(with respect to the QVC Group only) to dispose of or hold separate any of
its material businesses or assets or any portion thereof.

  



  

(d)  The Company and Parent acknowledge that, to the extent
reasonably necessary to expedite the grant by the FCC of any application for
renewal of any low-power television broadcast FCC license and thereby to
facilitate the grant of the FCC Approval with respect to such low-power
television broadcast FCC license, each of the Company, Parent and their
applicable Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter into tolling agreements
with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or
impose a forfeiture penalty against such low-power television broadcast FCC
license in connection with (i) any pending complaints that such low-power
television broadcast station aired programming that contained obscene,
indecent or profane material or (ii) any other enforcement matters against
such low-power television broadcast station with respect to which the FCC may
permit the Company or Parent (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to
enter into a tolling agreement.

  



  

(e)  If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason
within the original effective periods of the FCC Approvals, and neither party
shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or
more extensions of the effective period of the FCC Approvals to permit
consummation of the transactions hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC
Approvals, the Company

  



    

 69

 



    

and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in
effect the FCC Approvals to permit consummation of the transactions
hereunder. 

  



  

Section 5.6   _State Takeover Statutes_. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (a) take all
reasonable action necessary to ensure that no "fair price,"
"business combination," "control share acquisition" or other state takeover
statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if any
"fair price," "business combination," "control share acquisition" or other
state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement or
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all
reasonable action necessary to ensure that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms required by, or provided
for, in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 5.7  _ _Indemnification and Insurance._

  



  

(a)  For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the
present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and any individuals serving in such capacity at or with
respect to other Persons (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") from and against
any losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all
interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or
in respect of any thereof) in respect of the Indemnified Persons' having
served in such capacity prior to the Effective Time, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Law or provided under
the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, each as in effect on the date hereof.
If any Indemnified Person is made party to any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to matters that would
be indemnifiable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Company to, advance fees, costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and disbursements) as incurred by such Indemnified
Person in connection with and prior to the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  



  

(b)  For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any
successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination
of liability of directors, indemnification of directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries and agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no
less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding
provisions in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, each as in effect on the
date hereof.

  



  

(c)  From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and comply with
their respective obligations under any indemnification agreement with any
Indemnified Person, and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
agreement in any manner that would materially adversely affect any
indemnification right of any Indemnified Person thereunder.

  



    

 70

 



    

  



  

(d)  Neither Parent nor the Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under
this Section 5.7 (each, a " _Claim_ ") for which indemnification could be
sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise
or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from
all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise
consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned). The Company, Parent
and the Indemnified Persons shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and
shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or
appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  



  

(e)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable
extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's
existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_"), which DandO Insurance shall (i) be for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) be from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance and (iii) have terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against an Indemnified Person by reason of his or her
having served in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue
to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place with the Company's current
insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the Company's
current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect
to DandO Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no
less favorable than as provided in the Company's existing policies;
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the premium amount per annum for the
Company's existing policies; and _provided, further_ , that if the aggregate
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for
a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(f)  The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section
5.7 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws or

  



    

 71

 



    

any similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company,
under Delaware Law or any other Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

  



  

(g)  If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7. The obligations of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any successors or assigns under this
Section 5.7 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years
from the Effective Time (or if later the expiration of all statutes of
limitation applicable to any such claim);  _provided_ , that if any Claim
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against an
Indemnified Person on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.7_ shall continue in effect until the
full and final resolution of such Claim.

  



  

Section 5.8   _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent
shall consult with each other before issuing, and will provide each other the
opportunity to review, comment upon and concur with, and use reasonable best
efforts to agree on, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as either party, after consultation
with outside counsel, may determine is required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or stock market if to the extent practical under
the circumstances it has used reasonable best efforts to consult with the
other party prior thereto regarding the timing, scope and content of any such
press release or public statement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
consultation shall be required for the Company to make any disclosure or
otherwise take any action expressly permitted by _Section 5.2_. In addition,
except (a) to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement in accordance with the provisions of _Section
5.3_ , (b) to the extent necessary to comply with Parent's periodic reporting
obligations under the Exchange Act, (c) for any consent given in accordance
with this Section 5.8 or (d) as expressly permitted by Section 5.2, neither
party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or
disclosure concerning the other party or the other party's business,
financial condition or results of operations without the consent of such
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in the form
agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the issuance of
any press release or the making of any public statement with respect to which
the foregoing consultation procedures have been followed, either party may
issue such additional publications or press releases and make such other
customary announcements without consulting with any other party hereto so
long as such additional publications, press releases and announcements do not
disclose any non-public information regarding the transactions contemplated
by this

  



    

 72

 



    

Agreement beyond the scope of the disclosure included in the press release or
public statement with respect to which the other party had been consulted.

  



  

Section 5.9   _Listing_. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent QVCA Common Stock issuable under _Article II_ to
be authorized for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing.

  



  

 _Section 5.10 __Stockholder Rights Plans; Anti-takeover
Statutes._

  



  

(a)  The Company shall not withdraw, terminate, modify or
amend, in any respect, the Company Rights Plan Amendment, without the prior
written consent of Parent.

  



  

(b)  Prior to the termination of this Agreement, the Company
agrees (i) not to adopt any stockholder rights plan or similar plan or
agreement in addition to the Company Rights Plan (or to amend the Company
Rights Plan in any manner other than pursuant to the Company Rights Plan
Amendment) unless such stockholder rights plan by its terms exempts this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, in
all respects, including in accordance with _Section 3.20_ , _mutatis
mutandis_ , and (ii) to take all action to cause Section 3.19 to be true and
correct at all times (and otherwise refrain from taking any action that would
cause _Section 3.19_ to become untrue or incorrect at any time).

  



  

 _Section 5.11 __Employee Benefits._

  



  

(a)  For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the first anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided) to each Company Employee who
is employed with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (i)an annual
rate of salary, wages and/or commissions that is no less favorable than the
annual rate of salary, wages and/or commissions provided to such Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)incentive
compensation opportunities (including annual incentives, equity-based
incentives and other performance-based compensation) and employee
benefits (other than severance) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits
(other than severance) provided to such Continuing Employee during applicable
periods prior to the Effective Time; _provided _ that, in lieu of equity-
based incentives, Parent may provide cash incentives of substantially
comparable value, and (iii) severance protections and benefits no less
favorable than the severance protections and benefits provided to such
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b)  Each Continuing Employee who as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time is eligible for an annual bonus for 2017 under a Company Plan
(other than any performance cash awards that are scheduled to vest on
December 31, 2017 and were granted pursuant to the form of award agreement
filed as Exhibit 10.24 of the Company's Form 10-K filed February 21, 2013,
which awards shall continue to operate in accordance with the terms thereof)
and who remains employed with the Company or Parent or its Affiliates through
the regular payment date for such bonus or who experiences an Involuntary
Termination (as defined below) after the Effective Time and prior to such
regular payment date shall receive, on such

  



    

 73

 



    

regular payment date, the following bonuses: (i) for the period from January
1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, a bonus in an amount determined based on the
level of attainment of the applicable performance measures under such Company
Plan measured as of the date hereof against budgeted performance for such
period (applying the budget in effect as of the date hereof), which bonus, for
the avoidance of doubt, will be prorated to reflect the number of calendar
days during such period, and (ii) for the period from July 1, 2017 through
the earlier of the Effective Time (or the last day of the month immediately
preceding the Effective Time, if the Effective Time does not occur on the
last day of a month) or December 31, 2017, a bonus in an amount determined
based on the level of attainment of the applicable performance measures under
such Company Plan measured as of such earlier date against budgeted
performance for such period (applying the budget in effect as of the date
hereof), but in no event less than 70% of the target amount of such bonus,
which bonus, for the avoidance of doubt, will be prorated to reflect the
number of calendar days during such period. If the Effective Time occurs in
2018, each Continuing Employee who as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time is eligible for an annual bonus for 2018 under a Company Plan and who
remains employed with the Company or Parent or its Affiliates through
the regular payment date for such bonus or who experiences an Involuntary
Termination after the Effective Time and prior to such regular payment date
shall receive, on such regular payment date, for the period from January 1,
2018 through the Effective Time (or the last day of the month immediately
preceding the Effective Time, if the Effective Time does not occur on the last
day of a month), a bonus in an amount determined based on the level of
attainment of the applicable performance measures under such Company
Plan measured as of the Effective Time (or the last day of the month
immediately preceding the Effective Time, if the Effective Time does not
occur on the last day of a month) against budgeted performance for such period
(applying the budget in effect as of January 1, 2018), but in no event less
than 70% of the target amount of such bonus, which bonus, for the avoidance of
doubt, will be prorated to reflect the number of calendar days during such
period. For clarity, Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided) to each
Continuing Employee an annual bonus opportunity for the post-Effective Time
portion of the year in which the Effective Time occurs in accordance with
_Section 5.11(a)(ii)_. " _Involuntary Termination_ " with respect to a
Continuing Employee means termination of such Continuing Employee's employment
by the Company or Parent or its Affiliates without "Cause" or by such
Continuing Employee for "Good Reason" (as such terms are defined in the
Company's Second Amended and Restated 2008 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan).

  



  

(c)  With respect to any health or welfare plan maintained by
Parent or its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate at or after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) and their respective
third party insurance providers to, (i) waive preexisting conditions,
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
with respect to participation by and coverage of such Continuing Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) to the extent such requirements were
waived or satisfied under the comparable Company Plans and (ii) for any group
health plan, recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles
and similar expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs
for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations.
In addition, as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to, provide each Continuing
Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting, accruals and
determination of level of benefits under

  



    

 74

 



    

any employee benefit or compensation plan or arrangement maintained by Parent
or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) that such
Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time
for such Continuing Employee's service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes
of any comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.11(c)_  shall be
construed to require crediting of service that would result in (A) duplication
of benefits, (B) service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit
pension plan, or (C) service credit under a newly established plan for which
prior service is not taken into account for employees of Parent generally.

  



  

(d)  Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.4_ , the
provisions of this  _Section 5.11_ are solely for the benefit of the parties
to this Agreement, and no current or former Company Employee or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this _Section 5.11_. No provision of this _Section 5.11_
shall be construed as a limitation on the right of Parent, to amend
or terminate any specific employee benefit plan that Parent would otherwise
have under the terms of such employee benefit plan, nor shall any provision
of this _Section 5.11_ be construed to require the continuation of the
employment of any particular Continuing Employee. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to establish, amend or modify any Company Plan, Parent Plan or other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

  



  

Section 5.12 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Certain Tax Matters_. Each of the Parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(B) of the Code. The Company and
Parent shall cooperate in the provision of tax representation letters
substantially similar to the Company Tax Representation Letter and the Parent
Tax Representation Letter, respectively, to the Company's and/or Parent's
counsel, as applicable, as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
tax opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Merger that may be contained or set forth in the Registration Statement or
delivered to a Party in connection with the Closing. Except for actions
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, none of the Parties shall (and
each of the Parties shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to) take
any action, or fail to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to
cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

  



  

(b)   _Transfer Taxes_. All stock transfer, real estate
transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including
interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes) imposed on the Company or
the Surviving Corporation shall be paid by either the Company or the
Surviving Corporation. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution, and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires or other
documents with respect to such Taxes.

  



  

Section 5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

  



    

 75

 



    

(a)  The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, as the case may be, of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event of which is likely to cause any
representation or warranty of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to
be untrue or inaccurate at the Closing Date such that the conditions to
closing set forth in Article VI would fail to be satisfied, and (ii) any
failure by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to materially comply
with or materially satisfy any covenant or other agreement to be complied with
by such party hereunder such that the conditions to closing set forth in
_Article VI_ would fail to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.13(a)_ shall not limit or
otherwise affect any remedies available to Parent or the Company, as the case
may be; provided, further, that a party's good faith failure to comply
with this _Section 5.13_ shall not provide any other party the right not to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent
that any other provision of this Agreement independently provides such right.

  



  

(b)  The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) any
notice or other communication received by it from any third party, subsequent
to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging any
material breach of, or material default under, any Company Material Contract
or (ii) any notice or other material communication received by it from any
third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, regarding any consent that is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery such notice by the Company to Parent pursuant
to this _Section 5.13(b)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that a party's good
faith failure to comply with this _Section 5.13_ shall not provide any other
party the right not to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except to the extent that any other provision of this Agreement
independently provides such right.

  



  

Section 5.14 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly
advise Parent of any Action commenced after the date hereof against the
Company or any of its directors by Company Stockholder relating to this
Agreement or the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the
defense or settlement of any such Action and shall consider Parent's views
with respect to such Action, and shall not settle any such Action without the
prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Parent shall not enter into any settlement agreement
in respect of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors or officers relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the Company.

  



  

Section 5.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be required
(to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock or acquisitions of Parent QVCA Common Stock (including,
in each case, securities deliverable upon exercise, vesting or settlement of
any Company Equity Awards or other derivative securities) resulting from the
transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company or may become subject to

  



    

 76

 



    

 _such reporting requirements with respect to Parent in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act._

  



  

Section 5.16 _Cooperation as to Certain Indebtedness_. 

  



  

(a)  At Parent's direction, the Company shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries, and each of its and their respective directors,
officers, agents, employees and Representatives to, use reasonable best
efforts to commence promptly following the date hereof (or on such other date
as Parent may reasonably request) a solicitation of a consent and amendment
(the " _Credit Agreement Consent and Amendment_ ") to the Credit Agreement to
be effective on the Effective Time, on such terms and conditions requested by
Parent, which shall include an agreement by the requisite lenders
thereunder that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger, will not result in a Change of Control (as defined in the Credit
Agreement); _provided_ that (i) Parent shall consult with the Company
regarding the material terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement Consent
and Amendment, including the timing and commencement of the Credit Agreement
Consent and Amendment and any deadlines, and (ii) the closing of the Credit
Agreement Consent and Amendment shall be expressly conditioned on the
occurrence of the Effective Time.

  



  

(b)  If, prior to the Effective Time, Parent determines in its
sole discretion that the Credit Agreement Consent and Amendment will not be
obtained and become effective on the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, and each of its and their
respective directors, officers, agents, employees and Representatives to, use
their reasonable best efforts to:

  



  

(i)   on or prior to the Effective Time, (A) repay in full (or
in the case of any letters of credit issued thereunder, provide cash
collateral in an amount not less than the amount required under the Credit
Agreement) all Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) then
outstanding, (B) cause the release of any and all Liens (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) created or granted under any Credit Document (as defined in

form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent from the agent under
the Credit Agreement (the " _Payoff Letter_ "); it being understood that (1)
Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to effect the
Credit Agreement Termination using funds available pursuant to the Senior
Secured Credit Financing; _provided_ , that, to the extent the Senior Secured
Credit Financing is not available as a source of funding, Parent shall cause
the funds required to effect the Credit Agreement Termination to be made
available at the closing; and (2) none of the receipt of the Payoff Letter,
the consummation of the Credit Agreement Termination, or of any other
financing termination or the release of any Lien, shall be a condition to any
of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder; and

  



    

 77

 



    

(ii)  at Parent's election, cooperate reasonably with and assist
Parent, and each of its Subsidiaries, and each of its and their respective
directors, officers, agents, employees and Representatives, in
connection with new financing arrangements satisfactory to Parent (the "

management and accounting systems, policies and procedures for the purpose of
establishing collateral arrangements in connection with the Senior Secured
Credit Financing and (I) assisting Parent in obtaining ratings in connection
with the Senior Secured Credit Financing; _provided_ that (1) in no event
shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing pursuant to the
Senior Secured Credit Financing by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or

Sub's obligations hereunder and (2) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any definitive documentation
pertaining to the Senior Secured Credit Facility until the Effective Time has
occurred.

the arrangement of the Senior Secured Credit Financing other than with respect
to the Financing Fees, which shall be payable by the Company as incurred and
reimbursable to the Company as set forth in _Section 5.16(f)_.

  



  

(d)  The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in
connection with the Senior Secured Credit Financing; _provided_ that such

awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in connection with the
activities contemplated by this _Section 5.16_ , including the Credit
Agreement Consent and Amendment, the Credit Agreement Terminations, the Payoff
Letter and the Senior Secured Credit Financing, or any assistance or
activities in connection therewith, except (i) to the extent arising from the
willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or intentional misrepresentation
of the Company or its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
directors, officers, personnel and advisors, and (ii) for Financing Fees
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which shall be reimbursed
only in the circumstances described in _Section 5.16(f)_.

  



  

(f)  The Company will pay all fees and expenses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Credit Agreement Consent and
Amendment, the Credit Agreement Terminations, the Payoff Letter, the Senior
Secured Credit Financing and any other matters contemplated by this _Section

Parent shall reimburse the Company fifty percent (50%) of the Financing Fees;

 _applicable Law and the rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting

(a)  At every meeting of the Company Stockholders called with
respect to any of the following, and at every adjournment or postponement
thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of the Company
Stockholders with respect to any of the following, Parent hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees to be present (in person or by proxy) and vote (or
cause to be voted), or, with respect to any written consent solicitation,
deliver (or cause to be delivered) a written consent with respect to, all of
the shares of Company Common Stock Beneficially Owned or owned of record by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as of the applicable record
date (including the Parent Shares) (collectively, the " _Subject Securities_
"): (i) in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and any related
proposal in furtherance thereof, (ii) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or
postpone any such meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes

favor of any other matter necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall provide the Company with at
least five (5) Business Days' written notice prior to signing any action
proposed to be taken by written consent with respect to any Subject
Securities.

  



  

(b)  Parent hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted
with respect to its Subject Securities. In the event of a failure by Parent
to act in accordance with its obligations pursuant to _Section 5.20_ , Parent
hereby irrevocably grants to and appoints the Company (and any designee
thereof) as Parent's proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of
substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of Parent, to (i)
represent the Subject Securities and (ii) vote, execute written consents and
otherwise act (by voting at any meeting of stockholders of the Company or
otherwise) with respect to the Subject Securities, in each case, regarding
the matters referred to in _Section 5.20(a)_ until the Effective Time, to the
same extent and with the same effect as Parent could do under applicable Law.
Parent intends the proxy granted pursuant to this ___Section 5.20(b)_ to
be irrevocable and coupled with an interest and hereby revokes any proxy
previously granted by Parent with respect to the Subject Securities. Parent
hereby ratifies and

  



    

 80

 



    

confirms all actions that the proxy appointed hereunder may lawfully do or
cause to be done in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this proxy shall automatically be revoked at the Effective Time.
The parties acknowledge and agree that neither the Company, nor any of its
Affiliates, shall owe any duty (fiduciary or otherwise), or incur any
liability of any kind to Parent or any of its Affiliates, in connection with
or as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to the Company by this
_Section 5.20(b)_.

  



  

(c)  Subject to _Section 5.20(d)_ , Parent covenants and
agrees that, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, it will
not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, directly
or indirectly, (i) transfer, assign, sell, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or
otherwise dispose of (whether by merger, by tendering into any tender or
exchange offer, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise)
or consent to any of the foregoing (" _Transfer_ "), or cause to be
Transferred, any of the Subject Securities, (ii) grant any proxies or powers
of attorney, or any other authorization or consent with respect to any or all
of its Subject Securities in respect of any matter addressed by this
Agreement, (iii) deposit any of the Subject Securities into a voting trust or
enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any of the
Subject Securities or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect
thereto that is inconsistent with this Agreement, (iv) enter into any
Contract with respect to the Transfer of any Subject Securities or (v) take
any other action, that would restrict, limit or interfere with the performance
of Parent's obligations hereunder. Any purported Transfer of the Subject
Securities in violation of this _Section 5.20(c)_ shall be null and void ab
initio.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 5.20_ , "Transfer" shall exclude, with respect to any Subject
Securities, the entry into or performance of any Financing Transaction in
respect of the Subject Securities and any payment or settlement thereunder,
the granting of any lien, pledge, security interest, or other Encumbrance in
or on such Subject Securities to a Financing Counterparty in connection with
any Financing Transaction, the rehypothecation of any Subject Securities by
the Financing Counterparty in connection with a Financing Transaction, and
any transfer to, by or at the request of such Financing Counterparty in

damages that are the natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable result of
the event that gave rise thereto (which the parties acknowledge and agree

events, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any
other appropriate form of equitable relief to prevent breaches of this

the Company or Parent pursuant to _____Section 7.1(b)(i)_ (if the Company

in clause (A) or otherwise), and the transaction contemplated by such Company
Acquisition Agreement is later consummated, then the Company shall, on the
date such transaction is consummated, pay to Parent a one-time fee equal to
the Company Termination Fee ( _provided_ that for purposes of this _clause
__(ii)_ , each reference to "10%" in the definition of "Alternative Company
Transaction" and "Company Acquisition Agreement" shall be deemed to be a
reference to "50%")

  



  

(b)   _Parent Termination Fee_. In the event the Agreement is
terminated pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ and, at
the time of such termination, (i) the conditions set forth in _Section

(c)  The Company and Parent each acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay to the other party
any amounts due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ , and, in order to obtain such
payment, such other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against
the failing party for the amounts set forth in this _Section 7.3_ , the non-
prevailing party shall pay to the prevailing party its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this _Section
7.3 _ from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges that any amount payable by the Company or Parent
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ does not constitute a penalty, but rather
shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate a party for the disposition of its rights under this Agreement in
the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which
amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

  



  

(d)  Subject to Parent's right to specific performance set forth
in _Section 8.12_ , (i) Parent's right to receive payment of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ shall be Parent and Merger Sub's

current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling Person,
general or limited partner, shareholder, member, manager, director, officer,
employee, agent, Affiliate, assignee, representative or financing source of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (any such Person, other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries, a " _Company Recourse Related Party_ ") for any damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be

  



    

 87

 



    

consummated, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise
(other than any such failure with respect to which no Company Termination Fee
is payable), and (ii) upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, pursuant to
the terms hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any rights or
claims against the Company or its Subsidiaries under this Agreement, whether
at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Company have no
further liability to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (and in no event will Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries have any rights or claims against any Company
Recourse Related Party, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, arising out of this Agreement).

  



  

(e)  Subject to the Company's right to specific performance set
forth in _Section 8.12_ , (i) the Company's right to receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_  shall be the Company's
sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or any former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holder, controlling Person, general or limited partner, shareholder, member,
manager, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate,
assignee, representative or financing source of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(any such Person, other than the Parent and its Subsidiaries, a " _Parent
Recourse Related Party_ ") for any damages suffered as a result of the failure
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, whether
at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise (other than any such
failure with respect to which no Parent Termination Fee is payable), and (ii)
upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Company shall not have any rights or claims against Parent or Merger Sub under
this Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and Parent have no further liability to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and in no event will the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have any rights or claims against any Parent Recourse Related
Party, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, arising
out of this Agreement).

in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any assignment
in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the
preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 8.9   _Headings_. The headings and table of contents
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as
the foregoing can be accomplished without materially affecting the economic
benefits anticipated by the parties to this Agreement. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

Section 8.11 _Failure or Delay Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_.
No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any
right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

  



  

Section 8.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have
any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement (without the obligation to post a bond therefor) and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the Company or the Company Stockholders be permitted or entitled
to seek a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to
consummate the Merger unless:

  



  

(a)  all the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.3_  (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, each of which would be satisfied or are capable of being
satisfied at the Closing and those conditions that Parent's or Merger 

    

 91

 



    

Sub's breach of this Agreement has caused not to be satisfied), have been
satisfied or waived; and

    



  

(b)  the Company has confirmed in writing that it is ready,
willing and able to consummate the Merger.

  



  

Section 8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

Section 8.14 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto
hereby (a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit itself to the
sole and exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over
such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware) (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ")
in connection with any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b)
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in any of
the Delaware Courts, (c) agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
such litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum and
agrees not otherwise to attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
or venue by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d)
agrees that it will not bring any action, suit, or proceeding in connection
with any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in any court or other
tribunal, other than any of the Delaware Courts. All actions and proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, shall be heard and determined in the Delaware
Courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that service of process in connection with any dispute, claim, or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may be made upon such party by prepaid certified or
registered mail, with a validated proof of mailing receipt constituting
evidence of valid service, directed to such party at the address specified in
_Section 8.2_ hereof. Service made in such manner, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, shall have the same legal force and effect as if
served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware. Nothing
herein shall be deemed to limit or prohibit service of process by any
other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 8.15 _Incorporation of Exhibits_. The Company Disclosure
Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits and schedules attached
hereto and referred to herein are hereby incorporated herein and made a part
hereof for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

  



  

Section 8.16 _No Joint Venture_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed or construed as creating a joint venture or
partnership between any of the parties hereto. No party is by virtue of this
Agreement authorized as an agent, employee or legal representative of any
other party. No party shall have the power to control the activities and
operations of any 

    

 92

 



    

  

other and their status is, and at all times shall continue to be, that of
independent contractors with respect to each other. No party shall have any
power or authority to bind or commit any other party. No party shall hold
itself out as having any authority or relationship in contravention of this
Section 8.16.
