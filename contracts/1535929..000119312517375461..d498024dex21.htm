identified in the Dispute Notice and information, arguments and support for
their respective

or Independent Actuary, as applicable, shall thereafter be permitted to
request additional or clarifying information from the parties, and each of the

additional or clarifying information and not by independent review, only those
issues in dispute specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and shall
render a written report to Buyer Parent and Seller (each, an " _Adjustment
Report_ ") in which the Independent Accounting Firm or Independent Actuary, as
applicable, shall, after considering all matters set forth in the
Dispute Notice, determine what adjustments, if any, should be made to the
amounts and computations set forth in the Subject Closing Statement solely as
to the disputed items or amounts set forth in the Dispute Notice and shall

Initial Premium and Life Business Transferred Asset Value on that basis.

Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s or Independent ActuaryÂ’s, as applicable,
determination with respect to each of the disputed items or amounts specified
in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any, to be made to the Subject
Closing Statement, together with supporting calculations. In resolving any
disputed item or amount, the Independent Accounting Firm and the Independent
Actuary (A) shall be bound to the principles of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_
and the terms of this Agreement, including whether the Subject Closing
Statement was prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles or the
CTE95 Model and Calculation Methodologies, as applicable, (B) shall limit its
review to matters specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and (C) shall
not assign a value to any matter higher than the highest value for such matter

Firm and the Independent Actuary shall be paid by the party (that is, Buyer
Parent or Seller) whose position with respect to the matter in

 



40  dispute is furthest from the Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s or Independent
ActuaryÂ’s, as applicable, final determination. Each Adjustment Report, absent
fraud or manifest error, shall be expert determinations under New York law
governing expert determination and appraisal proceedings. Any claim, dispute
or controversy arising out of or relating to the final determinations of the
Independent Accounting Firm or the Independent Actuary, including enforcement
of such final determinations, shall be resolved in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 10.7_.

 

(vii) The final form of the Closing Statement as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing
Statement_ ," the Total Adjusted Book Value calculated therefrom is referred
to as the " _Final Total Adjusted Book Value_ ," the Required Adjusted Book

Value calculated therefrom is referred to as the " _Final RLI Transferred
Asset Value_ "), the Life Business Required Initial Premium calculated
therefrom is referred to as the " _Final Life Business Required Initial
Premium_ ") and the Life Business Transferred Asset Value calculated
therefrom is referred to as the " _Final Life Business Transferred Asset

Agreement, (i) the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ represent the sole
and exclusive method for determining the Final Total Adjusted Book Value, the
Final Required Adjusted Book Value, the Final DSL Net Capital, the Final
Company Ceding Commission, the Final Company Required Initial Premium, the
Final Company Transferred Asset Value, the Final RLI Required Initial Premium,
the Final RLI Transferred Asset Value, the Final Life Business Required
Initial Premium and the Final Life Business Transferred Asset Value and (ii)
the RLI Ceding Commission shall not be subject to adjustment.

other section to the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary,
predictive or otherwise forward-looking in nature), or (y) set forth in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer Parent and
Reinsurer Parent as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date
as follows; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any representations and warranties
that are made as of a specific date or as of the date of this Agreement are

SECTION 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is an insurance
company duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Iowa. DSL is a limited liability company duly organized,

Acquired Company and, with respect to the Business, Seller and its
Affiliates, has the requisite corporate or other entity power and authority to
own, lease or otherwise hold the assets and properties owned, leased or
otherwise held by it and to carry on its business as now being conducted,
except where the failure to have such power and authority would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Acquired Company and, with respect to the Business, Seller and
its Affiliates, is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other entity to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing (individually or in the
aggregate) would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



44 (b) Seller has provided to Buyer Parent true, complete and correct copies of
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other organizational
documents), each as amended to the date hereof (collectively, the "
_Organizational Documents_ "), of each Acquired Company. The Organizational

the Acquired Companies are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the Acquired
Companies were duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-

rights, Applicable Law, Contract or any of the Acquired CompaniesÂ’
Organizational Documents. VHI is the record and beneficial owner of all of
the Shares, free and clear of all Liens. VRIAC is the record and beneficial
owner of 100% of the DSL Interests, free and clear of all Liens. Assuming
Buyer has the requisite power and authority to be the lawful owner of the
Shares and the DSL Interests, upon delivery of and payment for the Shares and
the DSL Interests at the Closing as herein provided, good and valid title to
the Shares and the DSL Interests will pass to Buyer, free and clear of all
Liens. There are no restrictions upon the voting or transfer of any of the
Shares or the DSL Interests pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Companies or any other Contract to which Seller or an Acquired
Company is a party. Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, there are no securities, options, calls, puts, tag
alongs, drag alongs, warrants, rights, capital appreciation rights, phantom
stock plans, securities with participation rights or features, or similar
commitments or agreements, contingent or otherwise, which obligate Seller, the
Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates to issue, sell, repurchase,
redeem (or establish a sinking fund with respect to redemption), or otherwise
acquire or deliver shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any
Acquired Company. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
of any of the Acquired Companies having voting rights (or convertible into
securities having voting rights). Seller or one of its Affiliates has good
and valid title to, or has valid leases, licenses or rights to use the
Allocated Assets (other than Allocated Intellectual Property, which is the
subject of  _Section_ __ _ 3.21(a)_), in each case, free and clear of all
Liens (other than Permitted Liens).

SECTION 3.3  _Subsidiaries_. Neither of the Acquired Companies owns, directly
or indirectly, any shares of the capital stock of, or other voting or equity
interest in, any Person, except for Investment Assets held in the ordinary
course of business not exceeding five percent (5%) of the voting securities
of any such single Person.

 



45 SECTION 3.4 _Authority_. Each Seller Party has the requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will
be a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The
execution and delivery by each Seller Party of the Transaction Agreements to
which it is or will be a party and the consummation by each Seller Party of
the transactions contemplated thereby have been and, with respect to the
Transaction Agreements to be executed and delivered at Closing, will be, duly
authorized by all necessary corporate or other entity action on the part of
such Seller Party. Each of the Transaction Agreements to which a Seller Party
is or will be a party have been or, with respect to the Transaction Agreements
to be executed and delivered at the Closing, will be, duly executed and
delivered by such Seller Party and, assuming the Transaction Agreements
constitute the valid and binding agreements of the other parties thereto
(other than the Seller Parties), constitute valid and binding obligations of

their terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

that is or will be a party thereto, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby by such Seller Party, do not and will not (i) conflict
with any of the provisions of the Organizational Documents of any of
the Seller Parties, (ii) subject to the matters referred to in the next
sentence, conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or default (with

are treated as plan assets for any purpose of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code by reason of the application of any Applicable Law. None of the
Acquired Companies, or, with respect to the Business, Seller or any of its
Affiliates, have provided investment advice for a fee in respect of any
Insurance Contract held by any contractholder that is subject to Title I of
ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or exercised
any management or discretionary authority that would render it a fiduciary
under Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with respect to such
Insurance Contracts. No payment received by an Acquired Company or, with
respect to the Business, Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect of any
Insurance Contract held by any contractholder that is subject to Title I of
ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code that is from
a third party unaffiliated with an Acquired Company, Seller or any of its
Affiliates (i.e., in respect of any Registered Separate Account, including
12b-1 fees, revenue sharing, commissions etc.) has resulted or
would reasonably be expected to result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. From and including
June 9, 2017, none of the Acquired Companies or, with respect to the Business,
Seller or any of its Affiliates, have provided any "investment advice" within
the meaning of 29 CFR 2510.3-21(a) with respect to any Insurance Contract held
by any contractholder that is subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code other than with respect to the provision of such investment advice
that is subject to an exception or otherwise not considered "investment
advice" under 29 CFR 2510.3-21(a).

(c) Each Separate Account is, and has been, (i) duly and validly established
and maintained in all material respects under Applicable Law and (ii) since
December 31, 2014, operated in compliance with Applicable Law (including the
conditions of any applicable

 



66  exemptions obtained from provisions of the Investment Company Act), except,
in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business, taken as a whole.

(d) Each Separate Account either (i) is registered as a unit investment trust
or an open-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act
(each, a " _Registered Separate Account_ "), (ii) is not an investment company
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, or (iii) is not registered
as an investment company in reasonable reliance upon the exclusion from the
definition of an investment company in Section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of
the Investment Company Act and, except as is provided on Section 3.24(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, is not subject to Title I of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code. The registration of each Separate Account registered under
the Investment Company Act is in full force and effect.

 

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.24(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has received written notice of any
examinations, investigations, reviews, inspections or formal or informal
inquiries of the Separate Accounts, including periodic regulatory examinations
of the Separate AccountsÂ’ affairs and condition, civil investigative demands
and market conduct examinations, by any Governmental Entity that have been
conducted, or are pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened in
writing, since December 31, 2014 through the date hereof.

 

(f) (i) Each Separate Account currently is and has been since December 31,
2014 in compliance with its investment objectives, investment policies and
restrictions (as they may be amended from time to time) and other contract
terms; (ii) the value of the net assets of each Separate Account has been
determined and is being determined using portfolio valuation methods that
comply with the methods described in its offering or plan documents and (iii)
each Acquired Company, Seller and Affiliate of Seller that has provided
investment advisory services to any Separate Account has done so in compliance
with such Separate AccountÂ’s investment objectives, investment policies and
restrictions (as they may be amended from time to time) and other contract
terms, except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business taken as
a whole.

(g) Each Registered Separate Account has written policies and procedures
adopted pursuant to Rule 38a-1 under the Investment Company Act that are
reasonably designed to prevent material violations of the United States
Federal Securities Laws, as such term is defined in Rule 38a-1(e)(1) under the
Investment Company Act. Since December 31, 2014, there have been no Material
Compliance Matters (as such term is defined in Rule 38a-1 under the
Investment Company Act) that are materially adverse to any Registered Separate
Account, as such term is defined in Rule 38a-1(e)(2) under the Investment
Company Act, other than those which have been reported as required by Rule
38a-1(a)(4)(iii)(B), if any, and satisfactorily remedied or are in the process
of being remedied and those that would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business taken as
a whole.

 



67 SECTION 3.25 _Broker-Dealer_.

 

(a) DSL is and has been, since the commencement of its engagement in
activities for which registration as a broker-dealer is or was required under
the Exchange Act (such activities, the " _Broker-Dealer Activities_ "), duly
registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act, applicable state
securities law, and the rules of FINRA (" _FINRA Rules_ "). DSL is a member
firm of FINRA, in good standing. DSL is not a member of any other self-
regulatory organization. DSL is duly registered, licensed and qualified as a
broker-dealer in all jurisdictions where such registration, licensing or
qualification is so required. Neither the Company nor, solely with respect to
the FA Business, RLI have been at any time since December 31, 2014 or are
currently required to be registered, licensed or qualified as a broker or a
dealer under the Exchange Act, FINRA Rules or any other Applicable Laws. DSL
is in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws requiring
registration, licensing or qualification as a broker-dealer, and is in
compliance with all Applicable Laws concerning its operations as a broker-
dealer, except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business taken as a whole. Since
December 31, 2014, DSL has filed all regulatory reports, schedules,
forms, registrations and other documents, including Form BD and filings
pursuant to FINRA Rule 4530 and SEC Rules 17a-5 and 17a-11, as applicable,
together with any material amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, that it was required to file with any applicable Governmental
Entities on its own behalf or on behalf of any of its "associated persons", as
such term is defined in the Exchange Act and the rules and Bylaws of FINRA
(the " _Associated Persons_ ") (collectively, the " _BD Regulatory Filings_
"), and has paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith, except in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to be
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business taken as
a whole. Since December 31, 2014, the information contained in DSLÂ’s BD
Regulatory Filings, including the information contained in DSLÂ’s Form BD as
most recently filed with the SEC, was true, complete and correct in all
material respects at the time of filing, and DSL has made all material
amendments to such BD Regulatory Filings as it is required to make under any
Applicable Law. Seller has provided to Buyer Parent prior to the date hereof a
true, complete and correct copy of DSLÂ’s membership agreement with FINRA, and
DSL is operating in compliance with the terms and conditions of
such membership agreement except, as would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business taken as
a whole, and no Action is pending with FINRA to amend such membership
agreement.

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.25(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither DSL, Seller nor any of SellerÂ’s Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, any of DSLÂ’s officers, directors, security holders, employees or
Associated Persons has received written notice of any Action, audit, sweep
letter, examination or other inquiry (including by the SEC, FINRA, the
Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity) pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller threatened in writing, against DSL or against or involving
any officer, director, security holder, employee or Associated Persons of DSL,
as the case may be. Neither DSL nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any
Associated Person thereof is ineligible or disqualified pursuant to Section
15(b) of the Exchange Act to act as a broker-dealer or as an associated person
of a registered broker-dealer. There is no Action pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing, that would reasonably be expected
to result in DSL or any Associated Person thereof becoming ineligible to act
in such capacity. Neither DSL nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any of its
directors, officers, employees or Associated Persons is or has been adjudged
or is under current investigation or Action, whether preliminary or otherwise,
for "statutory disqualification" as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the
Exchange Act or is subject to any of the events set forth in

 



68  Rule 1014(a)(3)(A) and (C) through (E) of the former National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc., and, to the Knowledge of Seller, none of such
directors, officers, employees or Associated Persons is subject to heightened
supervision under the rules, regulations, ordinances or by-laws of any
Governmental Entity. Neither DSL nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any
Affiliate or Associated Person is subject to a disqualification under Rule
262 of Regulation A under the Securities or Rule 506(d) of Regulation D under
the Securities Act, or any similar disqualification provisions under
Regulation E under the Securities Act, except as would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the
Business taken as a whole.

 

(c) Except as disclosed in any Form BD or Form U-4 filed by DSL prior to the
date of this Agreement, neither DSL nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any of
its directors, officers, employees or Associated Persons is subject to any
order or Action of any Governmental Entity that permanently enjoins such
Person from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection
with any activity involving or in connection with Broker-Dealer Activities.
Neither DSL nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any of its directors, officers,
employees or Associated Persons is, or has been, the subject of any Action or
disciplinary event requiring disclosure on Form BD, Form U-4 or otherwise with
any Governmental Entity that has not been so disclosed, except, with respect
to such non-disclosure, as would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business taken as
a whole.

 

(d) Section 3.25(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of each "branch office" and "office of supervisory
jurisdiction" (as defined under FINRA Rules) of DSL.

(e) Each of DSLÂ’s directors, officers, employees, Associated Persons and
independent contractors, who are required under Applicable Law to be
registered, licensed or qualified as a principal, a representative, an agent
or a salesperson (or a limited subcategory thereof) with any Governmental
Entity are, and have been since December 31, 2014 (or such more recent date on
which such Person first became associated with DSL or the Business), duly
registered as such and such registrations are and were, since December 31,
2014 (or such more recent date), in full force and effect, or are or were in
the process of being registered as such within the time periods required by
any Governmental Entity, as applicable, except as would not be material to
the Business taken as a whole. Section 3.25(e) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth all Governmental Entities with which DSL and each of its
directors, officers, employees, Associated Persons and independent contractors
are registered, licensed, authorized or approved as a broker-dealer, a
principal, a representative, an agent or a salesperson (or any limited
subcategory thereof), including any membership in or registration with any
such Governmental Entity. Except as set forth in Section 3.25(e) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, none of such principals, representatives, agents
or salespersons is registered on behalf of any broker-dealer other than DSL.

 

(f) DSL has adopted written supervisory procedures that are reasonably
designed to detect and prevent any material violations under Applicable Laws,
and there has been no material non-compliance by DSL with respect to the
foregoing requirements or its own internal procedures and policies related to
the foregoing, other than those which would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Business taken as
a whole.

 



69 (g) DSL maintains its minimum net capital (i) in compliance in all material
respects with all Applicable Laws imposed by the SEC or any other
Governmental Entity and (ii) in an amount sufficient to ensure that it has not
been required to file notice under Rule 17a-11 under the Exchange Act. DSL
has no agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Governmental Entity to
increase its regulatory capital above the amounts required to be maintained
pursuant to Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. Since December 31, 2014, no
capital withdrawal or transfer of assets from DSL has occurred that was not in
compliance with FINRA Rule 4110, NASD Rule 1017(a)(3) or SEC Rule 15c3-1. DSL
does not guarantee any other personÂ’s liabilities, and none of DSLÂ’s assets
has been pledged to secure financing or a loan to it or any Affiliate or
Associated Person. DSL does not have any subordinated debt outstanding to any
Affiliate or Associated Person.

SECTION 3.26 _Third Party Administrators_. Except as set forth in Section
3.26 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of Seller, since
December 31, 2014, each third party administrator that managed or administered
insurance business for the Company or, with respect to the Business, Seller
or any of its Affiliates, at the time such Person managed or administered such
business, was duly licensed as required by Applicable Law (for the type of
business managed or administered on behalf of such entity), and to
the Knowledge of Seller, no such third party administrator has been since
December 31, 2014 or is in violation (or with or without notice or lapse of
time or both, would be in violation) of any term or provision of any
Applicable Law applicable to the administration or management of insurance
business for the Company or, with respect to the Business, Seller or any of
its Affiliates, except for such failures to be licensed or such violations
which have been cured, resolved or settled through agreements with applicable
Governmental Entities, are barred by an applicable statute of limitations, or
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 3.27 _Investment Assets_.

 

(a) Seller has provided to Buyer Parent a true, complete and correct list of
all Investment Assets owned by the Company, RRII and, with respect to the FA
Business, RLI as of November 30, 2017. Each of the Company, RRII and RLI, or a
trustee acting on any such entityÂ’s behalf, has valid title to all Investment
Assets, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens. As of the
date hereof, except as set forth in Section 3.27(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Investment Assets are subject to any Liability to fund
any capital calls or capital commitments or similar obligations. The
Investment Assets set forth on Section 3.27(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure

Assets_."

(b) Seller has provided to Buyer Parent true, complete and correct copies of
the investment guidelines and policies and the hedging guidelines with respect

70 SECTION 3.28 _CTE95 Model_.

 

(a) The CTE95 Model: (i) was used to generate results for the CBVA Business as
of June 30, 2017 and for capital management purposes in the ordinary course
of business, in each case as updated for assumptions adopted by Seller for
purposes of preparing its financial statements as of September 30, 2017 and
for purposes of its capital management program; (ii) was used to generate the
base valuation of the CTE95 Amount (without giving effect to clause (ii) of
the definition thereof) calculated under the explicit approach in accordance
with the document that was posted to the electronic data room that
was established in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as document number 3.2.35 ("Indigo Â– Reserves Capital Sensitivities
v15"); (iii) was used to generate the "CTE95 valuation sensitivity to equity
and interest rate levels" calculated under the explicit approach, which was
posted to the electronic data room that was established in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as document number 3.2.35 ("Indigo
Â– Reserves Capital Sensitivities v15"); (iv) is the arithmetic mean of the
"static hedge CTE" and "Best Efforts hedge CTE" results with respect to the
CBVA Business; (iv) is in accordance with the document "Annex B - Voya CBVA
Statutory Assumptions 3Q2017 v6.docx", which was posted to the electronic data
room that was established in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as document number 3.2.53; and (v) is consistent with
the methodology for generating inputs as set forth in the document posted to
the electronic data room that was established in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as document number 3.2.63
("CBVA_CTE95_Miscellaneous Inputs v6.xlsx."

(b) The methodology described in the CTE95 Model and Calculation Methodologies
for determining the Closing Date Starting Assets is consistent with the
methodology used to determine the starting assets used in the generation of
Anchor Valuation 1 and Anchor Valuation 2, as illustrated in document
"Illustration of Hedge Position Rebalancing for CTE95.xlsx" posted to the
data room as document number 3.2.85 on December 19, 2017, and would not be
impacted by SellerÂ’s discretionary hedge program transactions beyond the
Guarantee Hedge Program between June 30, 2017 and the Closing Date.

(c) The CTE 95 Model used at Closing when fed with the Valuation Input Set (as
defined in the CTE95 Model and Calculation Methodologies) as of June 30, 2017
will exactly reproduce Anchor Valuation 1 output.

(d) The CTE 95 Model used at Closing when fed with the Sensitivity Input Set
(as defined in the CTE95 Model and Calculation Methodologies) as of June 30,
2017 used to generate Anchor Valuation 2 will exactly reproduce Anchor
Valuation 2 output.

 

(e) The processes that will be used to generate the Valuation Input Set as of
the Closing Date are consistent with the processes used to the generate the
Valuation Input Set as of June 30, 2017 such that if the processes that will
be used at Closing Date were rerun with conditions as of June 30, 2017, the
Valuation Input Set for Anchor Valuation 1 would result.

 

SECTION 3.29 _Internal Controls_. Each Acquired Company and, with respect to
the Business, Seller and its Affiliates, maintains, in all material respects,
systems of internal accounting controls designed to provide assurance that:
(i) transactions are executed with

with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate actions are taken
with respect to any differences.

Section 3.30 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and except as required by a
change in Applicable Law between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date:

(a) The Tax treatment of each Insurance Contract is not, and, since the time
of issuance (or subsequent modification), has not been, materially less
favorable to the purchaser, policyholder or intended beneficiaries thereof,
than the Tax treatment (i) that was purported to apply in any written
materials provided by any member of a Seller Group to the purchaser (or
policyholder) at the time of issuance (or any subsequent modification of such
policy), or (ii) for which such policy was intended to qualify at the time of
issuance (or subsequent modification). For purposes of this _Section_ __ _

otherwise qualify as life insurance contracts for purposes of the Code. All
Insurance Contracts that are subject to Section 7702 of the Code satisfy the
requirements of Section 7702(a) of the Code and otherwise qualify as life
insurance contracts for purposes of the Code.

(c) Each Insurance Contract that is subject to Section 817 of the Code
complies with, and, at all times since its issuance, has complied with, the
diversification requirements applicable thereto, and the Company or RLI (as
the case may be), is treated, for federal Tax purposes, as the owner of the
assets underlying such Insurance Contract.

 

(d) None of the Insurance Contracts is a "modified endowment contract" within
the meaning of Section 7702A of the Code, except for any Insurance Contract

the Code, Treasury Regulations and forms issued by the IRS.

 



72 (f) The Company, and, with respect to the Business, Seller and its Affiliates,
has maintained the information reasonably necessary to determine the
Insurance ContractsÂ’ qualification for any applicable Tax treatment under the
Code, to monitor the Insurance Contracts for treatment as "modified endowment

its Affiliates, is bound by any agreement or arrangement, or is involved in
any discussions or negotiations with the IRS or any other Tax Authority, or
otherwise has requested relief, regarding the failure of any Insurance
Contracts to meet the requirements of the Product Tax Law Rules. In addition,
none of the Company, and, with respect to the Business, Seller or any of its

time of their issuance or purchase has been designed and implemented to
maintain such qualification and administration.

to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
Buyer Parent nor any of its Affiliates nor, to the Knowledge of Buyer Parent,
any officer, director or employee of Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates
has been permanently or temporarily enjoined or barred by any order, judgment
or decree of any Governmental Entity from engaging in or continuing any

75 (h) _Financial Ability_.

 

(i) Attached as _Exhibit_ __ _ I_ are true, complete and correct copies of
(A) the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, by
and between Buyer Parent and Apollo (the " _Apollo Equity Commitment Letter_
"), (B) the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, by
and between Buyer Parent and ALRe (the " _Athene Equity Commitment Letter_ "
and, together with the Apollo Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Equity
Commitment Letters_ "), pursuant to which each of Apollo and ALRe __ has
committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
invest in Buyer Parent the respective cash amounts set forth therein (the "
_Equity Financing_ "), and which, make Seller an express third party
beneficiary to the Equity Commitment Letters entitled to enforce the
obligations of Apollo and ALRe thereunder, subject to the limitations set
forth therein.

 

(ii) Buyer Parent has delivered to Seller a true, complete and correct copy of
the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, by and among
Buyer Parent, Buyer, AAIA and Reinsurer (the " _Debt Commitment Letter,_ " and
together with the Equity Commitment Letters, the " _Financing Commitments_ "),
pursuant to which each of AAIA and Reinsurer have committed, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to lend Buyer the amounts set
forth therein for purposes of funding a portion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with
the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "), and which make Seller an express
third party beneficiary entitled to enforce the obligations of AAIA and
Reinsurer thereunder, subject to the limitations set forth therein.

(iii) The Financing Commitments have not been amended or modified prior to the
date of this Agreement, and, as of the date hereof, the commitments contained
in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded
in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments (x) are in
full force and effect and (y) are legal, valid and binding obligations of
Buyer Parent and, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer, and the
other parties thereto and are enforceable against Buyer Parent and in the case
of the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer, and each of the other parties thereto,
in each case except that (A) such enforceability may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (B) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. Other than as set forth
in the Financing Commitments, there are no conditions related to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing under any agreement relating to the
Financing to which Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party. As of
the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred and no circumstance exists
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates or on
the part of any other party to the Financing

 



76  Commitments, under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments.
Assuming the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ will be satisfied at
or prior to the Closing, and assuming compliance in all material respects by
Seller with its obligations under this Agreement, Buyer Parent has no reason
to believe, as of the date of this Agreement, that Buyer Parent or any of its
Affiliates will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition
that is required to be satisfied by Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates as a
condition to the funding of the Financing by Apollo, ALRe, Reinsurer or AAIA,
or that the Financing will not be made available to Buyer Parent on the
Closing Date. There are no side letters or Contracts or arrangements, written
or oral, related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Financing.

 

(iv) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitments and performance by Seller of its obligations under this
Agreement, the funding commitments under the Financing Commitments are in an
amount sufficient to permit Buyer Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Agreements (other than
the payment by Seller to Buyer Parent of the Subscription Amount) and to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment of any amounts
in respect of the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated by this
Agreement) and to pay all fees and expenses payable by it at Closing in
connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

 

(i) _Solvency_. Assuming (v) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Seller in _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ (disregarding any references to
Knowledge, material, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifiers), (w) the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_, (x)
the performance by Seller of its obligations under this Agreement and (y)
that, immediately prior to the Closing, clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below, as
if they were made in respect of the Acquired Companies and the Business at
such time, are true, then immediately following the Closing and after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements,
including the payment of all amounts required to be paid by the Acquired
Companies or by Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates or Reinsurer Parent or
any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements and all related fees and expenses, each of Buyer Parent
and the Acquired Companies will be Solvent. No transfer of property is being
made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements with the intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of Buyer Parent, Reinsurer Parent
or any of their respective Affiliates, or of the Acquired Companies. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ," when used with respect to
any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" (on a going concern basis) of the assets of such Person
will, as of such date, exceed (x) the value of all liabilities of such Person,
including a reasonable estimate of contingent and other liabilities, as of
such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
Applicable Law governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (y)
the amount that will be required to pay the probable and reasonably estimated
liabilities of such Person with respect to its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(ii) such Person will

 



77  not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature. For purposes of this definition, (A) "not have an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of
such date, including a reasonable estimate of contingent and other
liabilities" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash to
meet its obligations as they become due and (B) the "contingent and other
liabilities" of a Person as of such date shall be computed as the amount that,
in the light of all the facts and circumstances known to such Person at such
date, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an
actual or matured liability of such Person.

(j)  _Brokers_. Buyer Parent is solely responsible for the payment of the
fees and expenses of any broker, investment banker, financial adviser or other
Person acting in a similar capacity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Buyer Parent or any Affiliate.

SECTION 4.2 _Representations and Warranties of Reinsurer Parent_. Subject to
and as qualified by the matters set forth in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule,
and subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, Reinsurer Parent represents and
warrants to Seller as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing

transactions contemplated thereby have been and, with respect to the
Transaction Agreements to be executed and delivered at the Closing, will be,
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of such
Reinsurer Party. Each of the Transaction Agreements to which a Reinsurer
Party is or will be a party have been or, with respect to the Transaction
Agreements to be executed and delivered at the Closing, will be, duly executed
and delivered by such Reinsurer Party and, assuming such Transaction
Agreements constitute the valid and binding agreements of the other parties
thereto (other than the Reinsurer Parties), constitute valid and binding
obligations of such Reinsurer Party, enforceable against such Reinsurer Party
in accordance with their terms except that (i) such enforcement may be subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditorsÂ’
rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought.

or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required by or with
respect to any Reinsurer Party in connection with the execution and delivery
of the Transaction Agreements by the Reinsurer Parties or the consummation by
the Reinsurer Parties of any of the transactions contemplated thereby, except
for (i) the approvals, filings and notices required under the insurance laws
of the jurisdictions set forth in Section 4.2(c) of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, (ii) such other consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations,
filings or notices as are set forth in Section 4.2(c) of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule and (iii) such other consents, approvals, authorizations,
declarations, filings or notices which if not obtained or made would not, in
the aggregate, materially impair the ability of Reinsurer Parent to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

time since December 31, 2014, received any written notice or other written
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any actual or alleged
violation of, or failure on the part of Reinsurer Parent to comply with, any
Applicable Laws, in each case other than any such item that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair materially
the ability of Reinsurer Parent to consummate any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Reinsurer

would reasonably be expected to impair materially the ability of Reinsurer
Parent to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Neither Reinsurer Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of
Reinsurer Parent, any officer, director or employee of Reinsurer Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries has been permanently or temporarily enjoined or barred by
any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Entity from engaging in or
continuing any conduct or practice in connection with the FA Business
conducted by the Company and RLI or otherwise that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on the ability of any Reinsurer Party to consummate any of the transactions
contemplated by any Transaction Agreement.

upon reasonable notice at reasonable times during normal business hours to the
Acquired Company Books and Records and, during such period, Seller shall, and
shall cause each Acquired Company as applicable, to, furnish to Buyer Parent
such information to the extent relating to the Business as Buyer Parent may

Contracts, records and information that (i) are subject to an attorney-client
or other legal privilege that would reasonably be expected to be impaired by

respect to the Business, each of its Affiliates, to, inform Buyer Parent of
that fact and provide a description of the general nature of what is being
withheld, and cooperate with any requests for, and use its reasonable best
efforts to (A) develop substitute arrangements that do not result in the loss
of such privilege or the breach of such obligations (including redacting

consent or waiver necessary from any Person to whom any contractual
confidentiality obligation is owed in order to disclose such information
to Buyer Parent and restructure the form of access, and/or make other
arrangements, so as to permit the access requested. For the avoidance of

Parent the Excluded Business Books and Records. All requests for access or
information pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ shall be directed to such
Person or Persons as Seller shall designate. Without limiting the terms
thereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall govern the obligations of Buyer
Parent and its Representatives with respect to all information of any type
furnished or provided to them pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_.

Companies, and, with respect to the Business, each of its Affiliates, to,
preserve and maintain the Acquired Company Books and Records, the RLI FA
Business Books and Records and the Excluded Books and Records in all material
respects in the same manner and with the same care that all such Acquired
Company Books and Records, RLI FA Business Books and Records and Excluded
Books and Records have been maintained prior to the execution of this
Agreement. At the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates,
as applicable, to, (subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_ and subject to the
last sentence of this paragraph) deliver to Buyer Parent, or its designee, or
cause the Acquired Companies to have possession of, (i) all original
corporate records of the Acquired Companies, including any such corporate
records relating to the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ legal existence, stock or other
equity ownership and corporate governance and (ii) all tangible embodiments of
Acquired Company Books and Records. Prior to the Closing Date, the parties

transfer, subject to compliance with Applicable Law and _Section_ __ _
5.2(c)_, of the electronic or intangible embodiments of the Acquired Company
Books and Records to Buyer Parent (or a Person designated by Buyer Parent) at
or after the Closing; _provided_ , that any costs attributable to such plan
and the transfer of the Acquired Company Books and Records are Separation and
Migration Costs and shall be borne by the parties in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 5.24(b)_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required to transfer the Books and Records that: (i) are necessary
for Seller to provide services under the Transition Services Agreement;
_provided_ that Seller shall transfer and shall cause its applicable
Affiliates to transfer, such Books and Records to Buyer Parent upon
termination of the Transition Services Agreement; or (ii) Seller or its
Affiliates are required to retain under Applicable Law; _provided_ that, in
the case of (i) and (ii), to the extent such Books and Records would otherwise
have been transferred, copies of such Books and Records will be transferred

Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled to retain copies of any Books and
Records transferred to Buyer Parent for accounting, Tax and regulatory
purposes. Any such retained Books and Records may only be used by Seller or
its agents for accounting, Tax and regulatory purposes.

 

(d) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing, (i) Seller and its
Affiliates shall, and shall cause each of their Representatives to, maintain
in confidence any written, oral or other confidential information relating to

possession of the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 10.13_, except that the foregoing requirements in clauses (i)
and (ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_ shall not apply to the extent that
(1) any such information is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of disclosure by Seller or its Affiliates (in the case of
clause (i)) or Buyer Parent and its Affiliates (in the case of clause (ii)) or
any of their respective Representatives, in violation of this _Section_ __ _
4.2(e)_, (2) any such information is required by Applicable Law, stock
exchange rules, Governmental Order or a Governmental

 



86  Entity to be disclosed; after prior notice has been given to Seller (in the
case of clause (i)) or Buyer Parent (in the case of clause (ii)), as
applicable (including any report, statement, testimony or other submission to
such Governmental Entity), (3) any such information was or becomes available
to Seller or its Affiliates (in the case of clause (i)) or Buyer Parent or its
Affiliates (in the case of clause (ii)) on a non-confidential basis and from
a source (other than the other party or any Affiliate (including the Acquired
Companies) or Representative of such other party or its Affiliates) that
is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with respect to such information
or is not otherwise obligated to keep such information confidential or (4) any
such information is reasonably necessary to be disclosed in connection with

process to disclose such confidential information, such party shall provide
the other party with prompt prior written notice of such requirement and
reasonably cooperate with the other party and its Affiliates, at such other
partyÂ’s expense, to obtain a protective order or similar remedy to cause such
information not to be disclosed. In the event that such protective order or
other similar remedy is not obtained, the party required to make such
disclosure or its Affiliates shall furnish only that portion of confidential
information that has been legally compelled, and shall exercise its reasonable
best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
such disclosed information. Each party shall instruct its Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives having access to such confidential
information of such obligation of confidentiality.

 

SECTION 5.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions, limitations and other agreements set forth in this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.4_), each of the
parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements.

 

SECTION 5.4 _Consents, Approvals and Filings_.

 

(a) Seller, Buyer Parent and Reinsurer Parent shall each use, and shall cause
each of their respective Affiliates to use, their respective reasonable best
efforts, and shall cooperate (and cause each of their respective Affiliate to
cooperate) with each other, and Buyer Parent shall cause each Investor who
holds, or who will hold as of the Closing, ten percent (10%) or more of
the outstanding voting equity interests of Buyer Parent or would otherwise be
deemed to be a controlling person pursuant to Chapter 521A of the Iowa
Insurance Code (each such Investor, a " _Control Investor_ "), to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to (x) comply as promptly as practicable
with all requirements of Governmental Entities applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement and (y)
obtain as promptly as practicable all necessary permits, orders or other
consents, approvals or authorizations of Governmental Entities necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements (including those set forth in Section 3.5 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, Section 4.1(d) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule or
Section 4.2(c) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule). In connection therewith,
Seller, Buyer 

 



87  Parent and Reinsurer Parent shall, Buyer Parent shall cause each Control
Investor to, and Reinsurer Parent shall cause each Reinsurer Party to, (i)
make, and Buyer Parent and Seller shall cause their respective Affiliates to
make, all legally required filings as promptly as practicable in order to
facilitate prompt consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to provide, and
Buyer Parent and Seller shall cause their respective Affiliates to use
reasonable best efforts to provide (and Buyer Parent shall cause each Control
Investor to use reasonable best efforts to provide), such non-privileged
information and documents to Governmental Entities as such Governmental
Entities may request, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to take, and Buyer
Parent and Seller shall cause their respective Affiliates to use reasonable
best efforts to take, such actions as may be required or requested by any
applicable Governmental Entities or as may otherwise be necessary in order to
obtain the approvals of such Governmental Entities and (iv) consent to and
comply with any condition imposed by any Governmental Entity on its grant of
any such permit, order, consent, approval or authorization other than any such
condition that would constitute a Burdensome Condition. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and subject to the
Resolution Process, none of Seller, Buyer Parent, Reinsurer Parent nor any
Control Investor shall be obligated to take or refrain from taking or to agree
to it, its Affiliates or any of the Acquired Companies taking or refraining
from taking any action, if taking or refraining from taking such action, as
applicable, would, or to suffer to exist any condition, limitation,
restriction or requirement that would, constitute a Burdensome Condition with
respect to Seller (in the case of clause (i) of the definition of Burdensome
Condition) or Buyer Parent or Reinsurer Parent (in the case of clause (ii) of
the definition of Burdensome Condition). Each of the parties shall provide
(and Buyer Parent shall cause each Control Investor to provide) to the other
party copies of all applications or other material written communications to
Governmental Entities in connection with this Agreement in advance of the
filing or submission thereof; _provided_ , that no party shall be required to
disclose to the other party, any of its or its AffiliatesÂ’ or any Control
InvestorÂ’s confidential or competitively sensitive information or any
personally identifiable information or non-public information of their
respective officers, directors or other applicable individuals. Prior to any
party being entitled to assert that a Burdensome Condition has been imposed,
such party shall follow the Resolution Process.. For the avoidance of doubt,
any reasonable steps a party agrees to take through the Resolution Process for
the mitigation of any potential Burdensome Conditions shall not themselves
constitute a Burdensome Condition hereunder, but shall be taken into account
in determining whether any condition, limitation or qualification constitutes
a Burdensome Condition hereunder.

 

(b)

(i) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) as promptly as
practicable and in any event within thirty (30) Business Days after the date
hereof, (I) Buyer Parent shall, and shall cause each Control Investor to file
a "Form A" change of control application with the Iowa Insurance Division
with respect to the acquisition of the Shares at the Closing as contemplated
by this Agreement, (II) Buyer Parent and, solely with respect to the Reinsurer
Parties, Reinsurer Parent shall, and Buyer Parent shall cause it Affiliates
to, file with all applicable Insurance Regulators all other requests for
approval of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements that
may be required to be obtained by it, respectively, prior to the Closing; and
(III) Seller shall file, and cause its

 



88  applicable Affiliates to file, with all applicable Insurance Regulators all
requests for approval of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements that may be required to be obtained by it in connection with the
entry into the Transaction Agreements or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby; and (B) promptly following the time at which the filing
required by clause (i)(A)(I) above has been made, Seller shall cause the
Company to file with the Iowa Insurance Division requests for approval of the
Pre-Closing Dividend. Buyer Parent and Reinsurer Parent shall, and Reinsurer
Parent shall cause Reinsurer to, use reasonable best efforts in cooperating
with Seller to obtain the approval of the Pre-Closing Dividend from the Iowa
Insurance Division. A reasonable time prior to furnishing any
written materials to any Insurance Regulator in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, each party shall
furnish the other parties with a copy thereof, and such other parties shall
have a reasonable opportunity to provide comments thereon; _provided_ , that
no party shall be required to disclose to the other parties any of its, its
AffiliatesÂ’ or any Control InvestorÂ’s confidential, competitively sensitive
information or any personally identifiable information of their respective
officers, directors or other applicable individuals. Each party shall give to
the other parties prompt written notice if it receives any notice or other
communication from any Insurance Regulator in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and, in the case of
any such notice or communication which is in writing, shall promptly furnish
the other parties with a copy thereof. If any Insurance Regulator
requires that a hearing be held in connection with any such approval, each
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for such hearing to be
held as promptly as practicable after the notice that such hearing is required
has been received by such party. Each party shall give to the other parties
reasonable prior written notice of the time and place when any meetings,
telephone calls or other conferences may be held by it with any Insurance
Regulator in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, and, to the extent permitted by the applicable Insurance
Regulator, the other parties shall have the right to have a representative or
representatives attend or otherwise participate in any such
meeting, telephone call or other conference (other than a telephone call
initiated by such Insurance Regulator and not scheduled in advance). Subject
to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_, Buyer Parent shall cause the Control Investors to
furnish any non-privileged information, representations, certifications,
applications, affidavits, forms and other documents, make any filings and to
take such other actions, in each case that may be required under
Applicable Law or that otherwise may be requested or required by any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, including as necessary to
complete and make any regulatory filing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Buyer Parent acknowledges and agrees that any
breach by any Control Investor of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_
will be deemed to be a breach by Buyer Parent hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such breach will be deemed to be cured if, within twenty
(20) Business Days of receiving written notice of such breach, the amount of
voting equity for which 

 



89  such Control Investor is entitled to subscribe is reduced such that the
Control Investor is no longer a Control Investor and Buyer Parent and each of
the other Control Investors have updated each applicable "Form A" change of
control application to reflect such change. To the extent the Pre-Closing
Dividend results in the CompanyÂ’s unassigned surplus being less than zero
dollars ($0), the parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer Parent may make an
application with the Iowa Insurance Division for a restatement of the
CompanyÂ’s gross paid-in and contributed surplus and unassigned
funds (surplus) under a quasi-reorganization in accordance with the Statement
of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 72 to become effective as of or
immediately following the Closing, such that the CompanyÂ’s unassigned funds
(surplus) immediately following the Closing will be equal to zero dollars
($0); _provided_ that the receipt of approval with respect to such application
will not be a condition to any partyÂ’s obligations under this Agreement.

 

(ii) Seller shall file or cause to be filed as soon as reasonably practicable
(and, in any event, with respect to the FINRA CMA (as defined below)), within
thirty (30) Business Days after the date of this Agreement an application for
approval of a change in ownership or control of the Company under NASD Rule
1017 with FINRA (the " _FINRA CMA_ ") and any notice or other filing with any
applicable State securities authority. Subject to the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_, each Party shall, as promptly as practicable, supply any
information or documentary material that may be requested by the other Party
to complete any such application or filing, including with respect to any
inquiries or requests for additional information or documents made by FINRA or
an applicable State securities authority. Without the prior written consent
of Buyer Parent, neither Seller nor DSL shall agree to any material
restriction to be imposed by FINRA as conditions to the FINRA approval,
including, without limitation, any requirement to maintain an amount of
regulatory capital in excess of the amount of regulatory capital required
under Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act as of the date hereof. Prior to filing
the FINRA CMA and any other materials or documents with FINRA, and prior
to making or filing with a State securities authority, Seller shall provide
Buyer Parent with a reasonable opportunity (not less than three (3) Business
Days) to review and comment on such FINRA CMA, materials, documents or
filings.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, following
the date hereof, Buyer Parent and each Control Investor shall be permitted to
update each applicable "Form A" change of control application to reflect
circumstances arising after the date hereof that result in any Other Investor
ceasing to be a Control Investor, regardless of whether Seller has provided
notice to Buyer Parent that any Control Investor is in breach of its
obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)(ii)_. Buyer Parent shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, enter into any agreement
or arrangement with any Person other than the Sponsors, Crestview or
Reverence pursuant to which any Person other the Sponsors, Crestview or
Reverence, or any of their Affiliates, would become a Control Person at or in
connection with the Closing.

  



90 (iv) As promptly as practicable and in any event within thirty (30)
Business Days after the date hereof, Buyer Parent and Seller shall file a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
acquisition by Buyer of the Shares, the DSL Interests and the equity of
Services Company contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer Parent shall bear full
responsibility for the filing fees associated with such HSR Act filing.

(c) _Third Party Consents_.

(i) Prior to the Closing, except as otherwise agreed by the parties, each
party shall cooperate with the other and use reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consents, waivers and approvals of Third Parties (other than
Governmental Entities) that are necessary in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including those set forth in
_Schedule_ __ _ 5.4(c)_.

(ii) To the extent that any Allocated Asset or Allocated Contract may not be
transferred or assigned to Buyer Parent or an Acquired Company without a
third-party consent that has not been obtained by the Closing, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to transfer or assign the same, if an
attempted transfer or assignment would constitute a breach or other
contravention thereof or would be ineffective or unlawful.

(iii) If, on the Closing Date, any third-party consent required to effect the
transfer of any Allocated Asset or Allocated Contract to Buyer or an Acquired
Company has not been obtained, or if an attempted transfer or assignment of
any Allocated Asset or Allocated Contract would be ineffective or unlawful,
then the parties shall cooperate with each other to reach a mutually agreeable
arrangement under which (A) Buyer or an Acquired Company would, in compliance
with Applicable Law and, subject to and without limiting _Section_ __ _
5.24_, obtain the benefits, assume the obligations, make all payments and
otherwise bear the economic burdens associated with such Allocated Asset or
Allocated Contract in accordance with this Agreement, including Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies and including that Buyer Parent
shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons for any and all Liabilities
arising out of or resulting from any action or omission by Buyer Parent or
any of its Affiliates before the Closing Date with respect to such Allocated
Asset or Allocate Contract) subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to
Buyer Parent or an Acquired Company, and (B) Seller would, and would
cause its applicable Affiliates to, enforce for the benefit (and at the
expense) of Buyer Parent and the Acquired Companies, as applicable, any and
all of their respective rights against any third party associated with such
Allocated Asset or Allocated Contract, and pay, or cause its Affiliates to
pay, to Buyer Parent all monies actually received by Seller or any of its
Affiliates in respect of such Allocated Asset or Allocated Contract.

 

(iv) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(c)(i)_, from and after the Closing Date,
the parties shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as

 



91  promptly as practicable, any such third-party consent required to effect the
transfer of any Allocated Asset or Allocated Contract to Buyer or an Acquired
Company that have not been obtained as of the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.5 _Public Announcements_. Each of Buyer Parent, Reinsurer Parent and
Seller, and their respective Affiliates, shall consult with each other before
issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon,
any press release or other public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (including regarding (a) its plans
relating to employees, Producers or other third parties or with respect to the
funding or operation of the Business or (b) any terms or conditions of any
Transaction Agreement) and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement with respect to such matters without the advance
approval of the other party following such consultation (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Applicable
Law or by the requirements of any securities exchange; _provided_ , that, in
the event that any party is required under Applicable Law or the requirements
of any securities exchange to issue any such press release or make any
public statement and it is not reasonably practicable to obtain the advance
approval of the other parties hereto as required by this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_,
the party that issues such press release or makes such statement shall provide

the Closing to terminate all Intercompany Agreements and Affiliate Agreements
and Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cause all intercompany
Liabilities (excluding the Surplus Notes), owing by any Acquired Company to
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any Acquired Company) to be paid
in full and settled immediately in cash prior to the Closing.

(a) At or prior to the Closing, each Acquired Company shall transfer any and
all right, title or interest, including all associated goodwill, which it may
have in or to the Trademarks set forth in Section 5.7(a) of the Seller

Trademark confusingly similar thereto (collectively, the "

Parent may at all times after the Closing Date retain and use, solely for
Buyer ParentÂ’s internal business purposes, records and other historical or

(c) Effective as of the Closing Date, with respect to any Excluded
Intellectual Property used in the Business during the twelve (12) months

event in a manner consistent with how such party sublicenses its own
comparable Intellectual Property.

as applicable, without the prior written consent of the other party, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,

SellerÂ’s expense, (B) such Acquired Company Books and Records and information
are not subject to an attorney-client or other legal privilege that in the

or disputes (except litigation or disputes involving Seller or any of its
Affiliates), compliance, financial reporting (including financial audits of
historical information), loss reporting, regulatory, Tax and accounting
matters (including for any such matters related to the Transition Services
Agreement), and Seller shall reasonably cooperate fully with Buyer Parent and
its Representatives to furnish such information and make available such
officers, employees and auditors of Seller or its Affiliates; _provided_ ,
that (A) such access, making available of officers, employees and auditors and
provision of information does not 

 



95  unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of any of Seller or
its Affiliates and is at Buyer ParentÂ’s expense, (B) such books and records
and information are not subject to an attorney-client or other legal
privilege that in the reasonable opinion of counsel to Seller would be
impaired by such access, (C) prior to affording any such access, making
available any such officer, employee or auditor or providing any such
information, Seller may require that Buyer Parent and its applicable
Representatives agree to customary confidentiality undertakings with respect
to any non-public information received pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
5.9(b)_ and (D) no auditors of Seller or its Affiliates will be obligated to
make any work papers available to Buyer Parent or any of its Representatives
unless and until Buyer Parent or such Representative has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such auditors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event of any inconsistency between this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ and _Section_
__ _ 8.4_, _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ shall control with respect to access to
records relating to Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, any costs incurred by
Seller and its Affiliates in responding to a request for books and records
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ for Acquired Company Books and Records that
were not previously provided as a result of a breach by Seller of its
obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, shall be borne solely by Seller.

SECTION 5.10 _D andO Liabilities_. For a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date, Buyer Parent shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
not to, take any steps that would reasonably be expected to affect adversely
the rights of any individual who served as a director or officer of any of
the Acquired Companies at any time prior to the Closing Date (each, a " _D andO
Indemnified Person_") to be indemnified, either under Applicable Law (to the
extent not inconsistent with the Organizational Documents) or the terms of
the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies as they existed
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, against any costs or expenses
(including attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses of investigation, defense and
ongoing monitoring), judgments, penalties, fines, losses, charges, demands,
actions, suits, proceedings, settlements, assessments, deficiencies, Taxes,
interest, obligations, damages, Liabilities or amounts paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any claim, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and relating to the fact
that the DandO Indemnified Person was a director or officer of the Acquired
Companies, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.11 _Non-Solicitation_ _and Non-Hire_.

(a) For a period of 24 months following the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Buyer Parent, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, whether directly or indirectly, solicit for employment (or engagement
as an independent contractor) the services of any Covered Employee;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_ shall prohibit
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from engaging in general solicitations not
directed at such Persons or from soliciting the services of any such Person
whose employment with or engagement by Buyer Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Acquired Companies) has been involuntarily terminated by Buyer
Parent or its applicable Subsidiary (whether for cause, due to position
elimination or otherwise) at any time or who has voluntarily ceased to be
employed or engaged by Buyer Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Acquired Companies) for a period of at least six months prior to the first
contact by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with such Person.

 



96 (b) For a period of 24 months following the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Seller, neither Buyer Parent nor Reinsurer Parent, nor any
of their respective Subsidiaries, shall, whether directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment (or engagement as an independent contractor) the
services of any Person who is employed by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing Date, other than any Business Employee or Available
Employee; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11(b)_ shall
prohibit Buyer Parent, Reinsurer Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) from engaging in general
solicitations not directed at such Persons or from soliciting the services of
any such Person whose employment with or engagement by Seller and
its Subsidiaries has been involuntarily terminated by Seller or its
applicable Subsidiary (whether for cause, due to position elimination or
otherwise) or who has otherwise voluntarily ceased to be employed or engaged
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries for a period of at least six months
prior to the first contact by Buyer Parent, Reinsurer Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries with such Person.

 

(c) For a period of 12 months following the Closing Date, without the prior
consent of Buyer Parent, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
hire or otherwise employ or engage any Designated Employee.

(d) Buyer Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates (including, without limitation, Reinsurer Parent and its
Affiliates) to, without the prior written consent of Seller, hire or otherwise
employ or engage any Available Employee who does not become an Additional
Transferring Employee during the 12 month period immediately following the
Closing Date, unless, prior to such hire or engagement, Buyer Parent,
Reinsurer Parent or one of their respective Affiliates reimburses Seller and
its Affiliates for any and all severance costs and benefits (including,
without limitation, any amounts paid or benefits provided to such Available
Employee during any period following the delivery of a notice pursuant to the
WARN Act to the extent that such notice under the WARN Act was required solely
by virtue of SellerÂ’s or its AffiliateÂ’s lay off of Available Employees, but
excluding all amounts paid prior to the Closing) in respect of such Available
Employee.

 

SECTION 5.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer of Employment_. Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall,
and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, (i) cause the employment of
each employee of the Company or DSL and all Liability associated thereto (to
the extent not related to the Business) to each such employee to transfer to
Seller or one of its Affiliates (except as contemplated by clause (ii) of
this sentence, other than an Acquired Company), and (ii) cause the employment
of each Covered Employee (but no Liabilities) to transfer to Services Company.
Seller shall identify all initial Qualified Employees and Select
Advantage Employees and all Available Employees to Buyer as soon as possible
after the date hereof, but in no event later than February 28, 2018. Seller
covenants that the employee of Seller and its Affiliates identified by Seller
to serve in each Qualified Role will have the seniority, experience and
functional expertise to fill such Qualified Role. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Covered Employees include
individuals identified by Seller and consented to by Buyer Designee (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to serve in
all Qualified Roles. Seller shall provide Buyer and Reinsurer Parent with
reasonable access at such times as are mutually agreeable to Seller and Buyer
and Reinsurer Parent to the Available Employees and individuals

 



97  identified as expected Qualified Employees (provided that Reinsurer Parent
shall only have access to Available Employees who are not Qualified Employees
or Designated Employee) between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date to permit Buyer to perform any reasonable diligence necessary to evaluate
such Available Employee for inclusion, as applicable, as an Additional
Transferring Employee (or, with respect to Reinsurer Parent, an offer of
employment) or a Qualified Employee. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Buyer may, in its reasonable good faith discretion, exclude up to
thirty Qualified Roles from the positions with respect to which Seller may or
shall transfer individuals to Service Company pursuant to the first sentence
of this Section 5.12(a) (any such Qualified Roles that Buyer excludes, an "
_Excluded Role_ "). Unless otherwise consented to by Seller, Buyer shall
identify all "Additional Transferring Employees" to Seller as soon as
reasonably practical after Seller identifies the Available Employees to Buyer,
but in all events no later than April 1, 2018. Seller shall waive any
noncompetition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and any other restrictions
to the extent such restrictions would otherwise limit the scope of any Covered
EmployeeÂ’s services to Buyer ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing, the Acquired Companies). In the event that any Inactive Employee
becomes eligible to return to active employment within 180 days immediately
following the Closing Date, Buyer Parent shall cause a Subsidiary to offer
employment (on terms and conditions consistent with Buyer ParentÂ’s
obligations pursuant to Sections 5.12(b) and (c) below) to such Inactive
Employee commencing on the date on which such Inactive Employee is first
eligible to return to active employment and, if such Inactive Employee
accepts an offer of employment from a Subsidiary of Buyer Parent, such
Inactive Employee shall be considered a Covered Employee for all purposes
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of Employment_. For a period of 12 months from and
after the Closing Date (the " _Covered Period_ "), Buyer Parent shall cause
an Acquired Company or one of its Subsidiaries to provide to each Covered
Employee who continues to be employed by an Acquired Company or one of Buyer
ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries: (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable,
that is no less than the base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable,
provided to such Covered Employee by Seller and its Affiliates immediately
prior to the Closing, (ii) annual cash incentive compensation opportunities
that are no less favorable to the Covered Employee than the annual cash
incentive compensation opportunities in effect for such Covered Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, (iii) total compensation opportunities
(including annual base salary or hourly wage rate, annual cash incentive
compensation opportunities and long-term incentive compensation opportunities)
of equivalent value to the total compensation opportunities (including,
without limitation, the value of any incentive compensation opportunities
that are provided in the form of equity or equity-based awards) provided to
such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (iv) employee
benefits that, in the aggregate, are of substantially equivalent value to
each such Covered Employee to those in effect for such Covered Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and as set forth on Section 3.9(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (other than defined benefit pension benefits,
retiree health, retiree life or other retiree welfare benefits, nonqualified
deferred compensation benefits or equity or equity-based compensation);
provided, however, that, Buyer Parent shall be deemed to not be in breach of
its obligations under this clause (iv) to the extent it uses commercially
reasonable efforts to procure benefits of equivalent value but is not able to
do so because equivalent benefits are not available on commercially reasonable
terms to an employer group of comparable size to the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and it actually provides the maximum available benefits that its
commercially reasonable efforts are able to procure on

 



98  commercially reasonable terms. For the avoidance of doubt, SellerÂ’s employee
stock purchase plan shall not be taken into account for purposes of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any
Covered Employee accepts an offer of employment from Reinsurer Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, Reinsurer Parent or such Subsidiary shall not be
required to provide compensation and benefits consistent with the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Covered
Employee who receives an offer of employment from Reinsurer Parent or
any Subsidiary thereof (other than Buyer and its Subsidiaries) and rejects
such offer and whose employment is subsequently terminated by Buyer or one of
its Subsidiaries (including an Acquired Company) shall remain eligible for the
severance pay and benefits described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_ (to the
extent he or she otherwise qualifies for such benefits). Buyer ParentÂ’s
obligations under this paragraph are expressly conditioned on Seller providing
to Buyer all information reasonably necessary for Buyer Parent to comply with
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_ within a reasonable
time following receipt of a reasonable written request from Buyer.

 

(c) _Termination of Employment; Severance_. The employment of all Covered
Employees shall remain "at-will" after the Closing Date, subject only to any
duly executed written employment agreement with a specific Covered Employee
(if any). Without limiting the generality of Section 5.12(b) above, Buyer
Parent shall cause an Acquired Company or one of its Subsidiaries to provide
severance pay and benefits to any Covered Employee whose employment is
terminated during the Covered Period for any reason pursuant to which such
Covered Employee would have been eligible for severance pay or benefits
pursuant to the severance policies described on Section 5.12(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Seller Severance Policies_ ") had such termination
occurred immediately prior to the Closing on terms and in amounts that are no
less favorable than as set forth in the Seller Severance Policies, in each
case, subject to the terminated Covered EmployeeÂ’s prompt execution of a
general release of claims in favor or Buyer Parent and its Affiliates in a
form reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Buyer ParentÂ’s obligations under this
paragraph are expressly conditioned on Seller providing to Buyer all
information reasonably necessary for Buyer Parent to comply with the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(c)_ within a reasonable
time following receipt of a reasonable written request from Buyer. To the
extent Acquired Company or one of its Subsidiaries terminates the employment
of any Qualified Employee during the six (6) month period immediately
following the Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the severance pay and benefits payable by Acquired Company or
its Subsidiaries with respect to such Qualified Employees pursuant to this
Section 5.12(c); provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to make
payments to cover severance pay and benefits to more than the difference
between (i) thirty (30) Qualified Employees less (ii) the number of Excluded
Roles.

(d) _Credit for Service_. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer Parent shall
cause to be provided to each Covered Employee under each employee benefit plan
maintained or contributed to by Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer
(collectively, the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits (including any
welfare plan, retirement plan, vacation program or severance program but not
for purposes of determining benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan) for
full and partial years of service with Seller or its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies and any of their respective predecessors) performed at
any time prior to the Closing Date to the extent such service was taken into
account under the analogous Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such prior service shall be
taken into account to the extent it would result in the duplication of
benefits.

 



99 (e) _Preexisting Conditions, Exclusions and Waiting Periods; Deductibles_.
Buyer Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies and its Affiliates to as
applicable: (i) waive or cause to be waived all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods or required physical examinations
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Covered
Employees and their eligible dependents under any health, medical, disability
and life insurance plans of Buyer, the Acquired Companies or one of their
Subsidiaries, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such Covered Employees and that have not been satisfied
as of the Closing Date; (ii) waive or cause to be waived all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Covered Employees and
their eligible dependents under any other Buyer Benefit Plans; and (iii)
provide each Covered Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid by such Covered Employee and his or her respective dependents prior to
the Closing Date and in the same plan year as that in which the Closing Date
occurs for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under the analogous Buyer Benefit Plan for its plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs. As a condition to Buyer ParentÂ’s obligation under
the preceding sentence, Seller shall provide Buyer or its designee all
information reasonably requested and necessary to allow it to comply with such
obligation.

 

(f) _Vacation/PTO_. Seller and its Affiliates shall pay out all accrued but
unused vacation benefits and other paid time off as of the Closing Date to
Covered Employees so that every Covered Employee has a zero balance of any
such vacation benefits or other paid time off in the manner and timing
required by Applicable Law as soon as administratively practicable following
the Closing Date.

(g) _COBRA_. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, Buyer
Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies or its Subsidiaries to be
responsible and liable for providing, or continuing to provide, health care
continuation coverage as required under COBRA with respect to any Covered
Employee who experiences a COBRA "qualifying event" after the Closing Date.

(h) _WARN_. If a plant closing or a mass layoff occurs or is deemed to occur
with respect to an Acquired Company at any time on or after the Closing,
Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing all notices required under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2109 _et_
_seq_. or the regulations promulgated thereunder or any similar state laws
(collectively, the " _WARN Act_ ") and for taking all remedial measures,
including the payment of all amounts, penalties, Liabilities, costs and
expenses if such notices are not provided. Seller agrees to identify for
Buyer, within five (5) business days following the Closing Date, (i) each
Affiliate of Seller from which any Covered Employee was transferred pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_, (ii) the number of employment losses of any
employee that took place at such Affiliate in 90 days preceding the Closing at
any single site of employment (within the meaning ascribed to such term in the
WARN Act) at which a Covered Employee was employed at any time within 90 days
prior to the Closing; (iii) for each employment loss that is identified in
clause (ii) above, the physical location of the employment site; and (iv) the
date of such employment loss.

 



100 (i) _Tax-Qualified Plans_. Buyer Parent shall cause an Acquired Company or
one of its Subsidiaries to maintain or establish, a defined contribution plan
that is intended to be tax-qualified (" _Buyer Â’s DC Plan_") and in which the
Covered Employees shall be eligible to participate as of the Closing Date,
subject to satisfaction of eligibility provisions and after taking into
account _Section_ __ _ 5.12(d)_. Buyer Parent shall cause an Acquired Company
or one of its Subsidiaries shall cause BuyerÂ’s DC Plan to accept any
"eligible rollover distribution" (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
elected by a Covered Employee from a tax-qualified plan maintained by Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) (to the extent
consisting of cash or notes relating to plan participant loans) in a direct
rollover to BuyerÂ’s DC Plan. In the case of any portion of any such rollover
amount that consists of a promissory note relating to a plan participant loan,
Seller, Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall cooperate with each other and
use reasonable best efforts to enable such direct rollovers to occur before
such loans default.

(j) _Cafeteria Plans_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer Parent shall
cause an Acquired Company or one of its Subsidiaries to establish and
maintain, a flexible spending reimbursement account under a cafeteria plan
that is intended to meet the requirements of Section 125 of the Code (the "
_Company Cafeteria Plan_ ") in which Covered Employees can participate. Buyer
Parent shall cause an Acquired Company or one of its Subsidiaries to allow
Covered Employees who participated as of the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Cafeteria Plan Participants_ ") in an Employee Benefit Plan that is intended
to meet the requirements of Section 125 of the Code (a " _Seller Cafeteria
Plan_ ") to participate in the Company Cafeteria Plan effective as of the
Closing Date. During the period from the Closing Date until the last day of
the plan year of the Seller Cafeteria Plan that commenced immediately prior to
the Closing Date, Buyer Parent shall cause an Acquired Company or one of its
Subsidiaries to continue, the salary reduction elections made by the
Cafeteria Plan Participants as in effect as of the Closing Date (adjusted, to
the extent necessary, to take into account any changes to applicable premiums
related to any Buyer Benefit Plan) and allow each Cafeteria Plan Participant
to receive reimbursement from such participantÂ’s flexible spending
reimbursement account under the Company Cafeteria Plan on the same terms and
conditions as would have been applicable to such participant as if such
Cafeteria Plan Participant were employed by Seller or one of its Affiliates
following the Closing during such period and continued to participate in a
Seller Cafeteria Plan. As of the Closing Date, (i) if the aggregate
accumulated contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts
made by Cafeteria Plan Participants prior to the Closing during the year in
which the Closing occurs exceeds the aggregate reimbursement amounts paid to
Cafeteria Plan Participants for such year from such accounts, Seller shall
transfer, or cause an Affiliate to transfer, to Buyer, an Acquired Company or
one of BuyerÂ’s Subsidiaries, as applicable, an amount equal to such excess as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date and (ii) if the
aggregate reimbursement amounts paid to Cafeteria Plan Participants for such
year from the flexible spending reimbursement accounts made by Cafeteria Plan
Participants exceed the aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts
prior to the Closing during the year in which the Closing occurs, Buyer
Parent shall cause a Subsidiary to transfer, to Seller an amount equal to such
excess as soon as practicable following the Closing Date. As of the Closing
Date, Buyer Parent shall cause an Acquired Company or one of BuyerÂ’s

 



101  Subsidiaries to assume and be solely responsible for all unreimbursed claims
made by the Cafeteria Plan Participants under each Seller Cafeteria Plan that
were incurred for the plan year of the Seller Cafeteria Plan that commenced
prior to the Closing Date, or that are incurred anytime thereafter.

(k) _Deferred Compensation Assumption_. Prior to the Closing, Buyer Parent
shall cause a Subsidiary to establish deferred compensation plans that are
substantially identical with respect to time and form of payment provisions
(but not, for the avoidance of doubt, benefit accrual or administrative
provisions) to the Seller Deferred Compensation Plans (such new plans being,
the " _Buyer Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") and, effective as of the Closing,
the Buyer Deferred Compensation Plan shall assume from the Seller Deferred
Compensation Plans (and thereafter be solely responsible for) all liabilities
in respect of the Seller Deferred Compensation Plan for or relating to
participants in the Seller Deferred Compensation Plans who are
Covered Employees. Promptly following the Closing, Seller shall, or shall
cause an Affiliate, to pay Buyer an amount in cash equal to the Seller
Deferred Compensation Plan Accruals. Buyer covenants and agrees to make all
payments pursuant to the Buyer Deferred Compensation Plan at the same time
and in the same form as such amounts were required to be paid under the terms
of the Seller Deferred Compensation Plans and any election forms thereunder
(unless a Covered Employee makes, and Buyer permits, a valid subsequent
deferral election to further delay the payment of such amounts or Buyer or its
applicable Subsidiary elects to terminate such Buyer Deferred Compensation
Plan). Buyer ParentÂ’s obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12(k)_ are
expressly conditioned on Seller providing to Buyer all information it requests
in order to establish and administer such Buyer Deferred Compensation Plans.

 

(l) _No Modification_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ are for
the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, express
or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment
to any Employee Benefit Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan or other compensation and
benefits plans maintained for or provided to Covered Employees or any other
Persons prior to or following the Closing Date or (ii) confer upon or give to
any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Covered Employee or any
current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors of the
Acquired Companies, Seller or any of their Affiliates, or on or after the
Closing, Buyer Parent, the Acquired Companies or any of their post-Closing
Affiliates), other than the parties hereto, any legal or equitable or
other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.12_ under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_
shall confer upon any Covered Employee any right to continued employment with
Buyer Parent, any Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates after the
Closing Date and nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ is intended to
guarantee employment to any Covered Employee for any period of time.

SECTION 5.13  _Financing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, prior to the
Closing, Buyer Parent shall take or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable
Financing Commitments not later than the date that the Closing is required to
occur in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, including: (i) maintaining in
full

 



102  force and effect the Financing Commitments; (ii) satisfying all conditions
applicable to Buyer Parent and in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter,
Buyer, in the Financing Commitments that are within their control; (iii)
complying on a timely basis with their obligations under the Financing
Commitments; (iv) consummating the Financing at or prior to the date that the
Closing is required to occur in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_; and
(v) enforcing their rights under the Financing Commitments. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_ will require, and in no event will Buyer Parent be
required to seek the Financing from any source other than a counterparty to,
or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Financing Commitments.

 

(b) Buyer Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), permit
any amendment or modification to be made to or waiver of any rights under the
Financing Commitments, and, upon the consummation of the Financing to Buyer
Parent or, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer, in
accordance with the Financing Commitments, Buyer Parent shall draw down at
Closing such amount of such Financing as is required to fully make the
payments pursuant to _Article_ __ _ II_. Buyer Parent shall not permit Buyer
to release or consent to the termination of the obligations of AAIA or
Reinsurer under the Debt Commitment Letter without SellerÂ’s prior written
consent.

 

(c) Buyer Parent shall provide Seller with prompt written notice of the
receipt of any notice or other communication from AAIA or Reinsurer with
respect to its failure or anticipated failure to fund its commitments under
any Financing Commitment. Buyer Parent shall keep Seller reasonably informed
on a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing.

 

SECTION 5.14 _Specified Contracts_. Section 5.14 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of the " _Specified Contracts_." Upon Buyer
ParentÂ’s request, with respect to any Specified Contract, Seller and Buyer
Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, reasonably
cooperate in good faith with Buyer ParentÂ’s efforts to cause the counterparty
to any such Specified Contract to enter into a new contract with Buyer Parent
or its designee, effective as of the Closing or at the end of the relevant
transition service period, if applicable, on terms substantially similar to
those contained in such Specified Contract (each such new Contract, a " _New
Contract_ ").

SECTION 5.15 _Non-competition_. From the Closing until the second (2nd)
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Non-Compete Period_"), Seller agrees
not to, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, (a) solicit, induce or persuade or attempt to solicit, induce or
persuade any Producer or other Person through which fixed annuity or fixed
index annuity Insurance Contracts were written, marketed, produced, sold or
solicited during the twenty-four (24) months preceding the Closing Date to (i)
terminate, restrict or avoid entering into any business relationship or
dealings with Buyer Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Acquired
Company after the Closing) or Reinsurer Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) enter into any distribution, marketing, production or similar business
relationship with Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the
writing, marketing, production, sale or solicitation of fixed annuities or
fixed index annuities or (iii) solicit any holders of Insurance Contracts or
otherwise use policyholder lists for the purposes of writing, marketing, 

 



103  producing, selling or soliciting any fixed annuity or fixed index annuity
products; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, and without restricting
the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ shall
restrict the ability of Seller or any of its Affiliates to conduct its
Retirement business (including the entirety of all business activities
conducted under SellerÂ’s Retirement segment) in substantially the same manner
as it is conducted on the date hereof.

SECTION 5.16 _Financial Information_.

 

(a) __From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller shall make
available to Buyer Parent (i) within forty-five (45) days following the end
of each calendar quarter other than the last calendar quarter of any calendar
year, (a) the unaudited statutory statements of the Company, in each case
together with the exhibits, schedules and notes thereto (collectively, the "
_Future Quarterly Statutory Statements_ "), and (b) (x) the separate unaudited
quarterly GAAP financial statements of each of the Acquired Companies and (y)
the separate unaudited quarterly Modified GAAP financial statements of RRII
(collectively, the " _Future Quarterly GAAP Financial Statements_ "), in each
case, as of the end of and for such calendar quarter, (ii) (a) within sixty
(60) days following the end of each calendar year, the unaudited statutory
statements of the Company, (b) as soon as practicable, but in any event on or
prior to June 1st following each calendar year that is completed prior to the
Closing Date, commencing with the calendar year ended December 31, 2017, the
audited annual statutory financial statements of the Company, as of and for
the end of such year, together with the report of the CompanyÂ’s independent
certified public accountant, and in each case together with the exhibits,
schedules and notes thereto (collectively, the " _Future Annual Statutory
Statements_ "), and (c) within seventy-five (75) days following the end of
each calendar year, the separate audited GAAP financial statements, if
prepared, or if not prepared, (x) unaudited annual GAAP financial statements
of each of the Acquired Companies and (y) unaudited annual Modified GAAP
financial statements of RRII (collectively, the " _Future Annual GAAP
Financial Statements_ "), in each case, as of and for such calendar year, and
(iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the preparation thereof,

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, at Reinsurer
ParentÂ’s expense, provide reasonable cooperation to Reinsurer Parent and its
Affiliates or Apollo and its Affiliates in connection with the preparation of
any historical financial statements or other disclosures (including those
required by GAAP or the SEC) or information with respect to the Business or
the Acquired Companies that Reinsurer Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Apollo and its Affiliates may be required to provide to or file with any
Governmental Entity (including with the SEC under Regulation S-K or S-X) or
delivered to any underwriter, including in connection with any offering,
credit facility or borrowing by Reinsurer Parent, Apollo or any of their
respective Affiliates. Such cooperation shall include, furnishing Reinsurer
Parent or Apollo such financial statements, financial information and other
pertinent information with respect to the Business or the Acquired Companies
as may be reasonably requested by Reinsurer Parent or Apollo (including
"carve-out" financial statements that give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements),
including to assist Reinsurer Parent or any of its Affiliates or Apollo and
its Affiliates with managementÂ’s discussion and analyses or other portions of
any such documents.

 



104 (c) If the Company is reasonably likely to be required to file any quarterly
or annual reports pursuant to the Exchange Act within thirty (30) days after
the Closing, Seller will cause the Company to prepare draft reports that as of
the Closing are sufficiently developed, taking into account the time that has
elapsed since the end of the applicable reporting period and the time until
such report is required to be filed, such that it can be timely filed with a
reasonable amount of effort within the time available following the Closing
(the " _Post-Closing SEC Reports_ "). The Post-Closing SEC Reports provided
will (i) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading and (ii) comply in all material respects with
the provisions of Applicable Law.

 

SECTION 5.17 _Investment Assets_. Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable
Affiliates to, deliver to Buyer Parent, on a monthly basis until such time as
the Closing is reasonably expected to occur within one month, and thereafter
weekly, a summary report of (i) all transaction activity and other significant
events with respect to the Investment Assets and (ii) the cash management
strategy and activities of the Acquired Companies, RRII and, with respect to
the Business, RLI. From and after the date hereof until the Closing, Seller
shall cause the applicable managers having primary responsibility for the
matters set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) to consult with
Representatives of Buyer Parent as reasonably requested by Buyer Parent with
respect to such matters, including future planned or potential purchases and
sales of Investment Assets and the treatment of any impaired or potentially
impaired Investment Assets; _provided_ that such consultations shall be upon
reasonable notice at reasonable times during normal business hours and shall
not unreasonably disrupt the business of Seller or the Acquired Companies. In
such meetings with management, Buyer Parent or its Representative may make
recommendations to Seller with respect to such matters.

 

SECTION 5.18 _Policyholder Lists_. After the date of this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the
Acquired Companies) shall share or provide any policyholder or similar
information with respect to the Business to any Producer or other Person,
except for the provision of any such information as required by judicial or
administrative process or, in the written opinion of counsel to Seller or any
of its Affiliates, as applicable, by other requirements of Applicable Law, and
except, prior to Closing, for the provision of any such information in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices of the Acquired
Companies.

SECTION 5.19 _Acquisition Proposals_. From the date hereof through
the earlier of the Closing Date and the date of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article IX_ , as applicable, Seller shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly (a) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, facilitate or
accept any inquiries, proposals, offers or other indications of interest by or
from any Person with respect to: (i) any acquisition, purchase or other
transaction involving the direct or indirect sale or transfer of all or any
substantial part of the Business or the Allocated Assets (excluding sales of
Investment Assets and the entry into the consummation of, or the making of
payments under, any hedging transaction) or the equity interests of the
Acquired Companies, or (ii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
reorganization, dissolution, recapitalization or similar transaction involving
the Acquired Companies (each, an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), but

 



105  excluding, in each case, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or (b) participate in
any discussions or negotiations with respect to, or furnish or confirm any
information to any Person in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal. In the
event that Seller, an Acquired Company or any Affiliate of Seller or the
Acquired Companies receives an Acquisition Proposal, the Person receiving
such Acquisition Proposal shall promptly, but in no event later than forty-
eight (48) hours thereafter, notify Buyer Parent in writing of such proposal
and provide a copy thereof (if in written or electronic form) or, if in oral
form, a written summary of the terms and conditions thereof, including the
names of the interested parties. For the avoidance of doubt, any inquiries,
proposals, offers or indications of interest or other agreements relating to
any Permitted Transaction shall not be considered an Acquisition Proposal
hereunder.

SECTION 5.20 _Insurance_.

 

(a) With respect to events or circumstances relating to the Acquired Companies
that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date that are covered by
occurrence-based insurance policies and resulting in a loss or liability to
the Acquired Companies or Buyer Parent or any of its other Subsidiaries after
the Closing, the Acquired Companies may, to the extent permitted thereunder
and to the extent of such loss or liability, make claims under such policies
so long as such claims are not reasonably expected to result in non- _de
minimis_ increased costs or Liabilities to Seller or any of its Affiliates.
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide reasonable
cooperation and assistance in the pursuit of such claims.

(b) With respect to any open claims against the insurance policies of Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) relating to
losses suffered by the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date that are
not Excluded Liabilities and for which either (x) the applicable insured
asset has been reflected on the Final Closing Statement without giving effect
to the full impairment or loss of value resulting from the insured loss or (y)
a receivable in respect of such claim is reflected on the Final Closing
Statement, Seller shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to pursue such claims
and shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Buyer Parent and its Affiliates
in doing the same and (ii) remit to Buyer all proceeds realized from
such claims; _provided_ , that no Buyer Indemnified Person has been
indemnified with respect to such amounts under _Article VII_.

 

SECTION 5.21 _Additional FA Contracts_. Upon written notice delivered by
Seller to Buyer Parent at least 45 days prior to the Closing, Seller, in its
sole discretion, may elect to cede the FA Contracts written by SLD and VRIAC
that are identified in the Actuarial Reports (the " _Additional FA Contracts_
") to Reinsurer. In the event that Seller elects to cede the Additional FA
Contracts to Reinsurer, at the Closing, (a) Reinsurer shall enter into a
reinsurance agreement with each of SLD and VRIAC, substantially in the form of
the RLI FA Business Reinsurance Agreement, and SLD and VRIAC shall pay an
amount equal to the absolute value of the ceding commission to Reinsurer set
forth on _Schedule 5.21_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that upon written notice
delivered by Buyer Parent to Seller 10 days after receiving the notice
described above from Seller, Reinsurer may, in its sole discretion, offer to
ALRe and ALRe may elect that the Additional FA Contracts be ceded to Alternate
Reinsurer instead of Reinsurer, and in such event, Alternate Reinsurer shall
enter into a reinsurance agreement with each of SLD and VRIAC, substantially
in the form of the Alternate RLI Business Reinsurance Agreement, and

 



106  SLD and VRIAC shall pay the absolute value of the ceding commission to
Alternate Reinsurer set forth on _Schedule 5.21_ , and (b) the Company shall
enter into an administrative services agreement, in the form of the RLI
Retained Business Administrative Services Agreement, with each of SLD and
VRIAC, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein, the Company will provide to each of SLD and
VRIAC administrative services with respect to the business of SLD and VRIAC
related to the Additional FA Contracts, including cancelling, reinsuring and
administering the Additional FA Contracts reinsured under the applicable
reinsurance agreement entered into by Reinsurer or ALRe, as applicable, and
each of SLD and VRIAC, as applicable (and SLD, VRIAC and the Company shall not
enter into the SLD Administrative Services Agreement or the VRIAC
Administrative Services Agreement, as applicable).

 

SECTION 5.22 _Restructuring; Transaction Agreements_. Prior to the Closing,
and subject to its receipt of the approvals contemplated in  _Section_ __ _
3.5_, (i) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to enter into the
Restructuring Agreements and (ii) Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, make any change or modification to the form of the CBVA
Recapture Agreement or the form of any of the Restructuring Agreements that,
individually or in the aggregate with other changes or modifications, (A)
adversely affects Buyer Parent, Reinsurer Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates or the Business or any Acquired Company (after giving
effect to the Pre-Sale Transactions) or (B) prevents, impairs or delays the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the performance of any
partyÂ’s obligations under, the Transaction Agreements, in either case, without
the prior written consent of Buyer Parent.

 

SECTION 5.23 _CTE95 Reports_. Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer Parent
by the tenth (10th) Business Day of each calendar month between the date
hereof and the Closing Date, and Buyer Parent shall prepare and deliver to
Seller by twelfth (12th) Business Day of each calendar month between the date
hereof and the Closing Date, a report (each, an " _Interim CTE95 Report_ ")
setting forth such partyÂ’s calculation of the Required Adjusted Book Value as
of the end of the immediately preceding month. Each Interim CTE95 Report
delivered by Seller shall include MillimanÂ’s calculation of the CTE95 Amount
as of the end of such prior month. Seller shall cause Milliman to calculate
each such CTE95 Amount using the same CTE95 Model used for purposes of
calculating the CTE95 Amount included in the Reference Closing Statement and
in accordance with the CTE95 Model and Calculation Methodologies. Buyer Parent
and Seller shall, and Buyer Parent shall cause Milliman to, each cooperate
with each other in the preparation of the Interim CTE95 Reports, including
providing all relevant information necessary to prepare such reports,
including all information provided to Milliman by Seller or its Affiliates in
connection with MillimanÂ’s preparation of the applicable Interim CTE95
Report or that Buyer Parent may otherwise reasonably request. Buyer Parent
and Seller shall, and Seller shall cause Milliman to, use their reasonable
best efforts to resolve any differences and to correct any errors or mistakes
in the preparation of, and any inaccuracies reflected in, their respective
Interim CTE95 Reports.

SECTION 5.24 _Migration and Separation_.

 

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer Parent
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to,
discuss in good faith and cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to develop
and implement a written migration plan

 



107  based on the services necessary and targeted budget of $65,000,000 which
sets forth steps required (i) to make an orderly separation of the Business,
including Business IT Systems, following the Closing from that of the
Excluded Business and other businesses of Seller and its Affiliates and (ii)
for integration and migration of the Business, including required Business IT
Systems, following the Closing or the end of a Service Term (as defined in
the Transition Services Agreement) for a Scheduled Service (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) provided under the Transition Services
Agreement, as applicable, into the business and operations of Buyer Parent
(including the Acquired Companies).

(b) All Separation and Migration Costs shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by
Buyer Parent until the aggregate amount of all such Separation and Migration
Costs equals $65,000,000 (the maximum aggregate liability of Seller under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.24(b)_ shall not exceed $32,500,000, and Buyer Parent will
bear 100% of such Separation and Migration Costs that are in excess of
$65,000,000). For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.24(b)_ shall not apply with respect to the third-party
consent costs required to be obtained by Seller and its Affiliates to allow
Seller and its Affiliates to perform services under the Transition Services
Agreement and such third-party consent costs shall be borne 50% by Seller and
50% by Buyer Parent as described in Section 2.7 of the Transition Services
Agreement, and, for clarity (i) such third-party consent costs are not
Separation and Migration Costs and (ii) shall not be taken into account in
determining whether such limitations under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.24(b)_
have been exceeded. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason and the
Closing does not occur, each party shall promptly reimburse the other for any
amounts previously paid by such other party that the first party is required
to bear pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.24(b)_ and that it has not
previously paid. If the Closing occurs, Seller may, after the Closing, choose
to pay the aggregate remaining amount it is required to bear pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.24(b)_ by making equal quarterly installment payments to
Buyer Parent over the first year after the Closing.

 

SECTION 5.25 _Hedging Arrangements_. Seller and Buyer Parent shall follow the
hedging protocol set forth on _Schedule 5.25_. All costs and expenses
relating to the termination of any hedging arrangements shall be reflected in
the Estimated Total Adjusted Book Value and the Final Total Adjusted Book
Value or otherwise be borne by Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies).

SECTION 5.26 _Deregistration of the Company_. Between the date hereof and
Closing (with effect prior to the Effective Time), Seller shall use its best
efforts, and shall cause the Company and its Affiliates as applicable to use
their best efforts, to cause any Insurance Contracts and fixed or fixed index
investment options under variable Insurance Contracts, as appropriate,
currently registered with the SEC on Forms S-1 or S-3 to become exempt from
registration under the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 3(a)(8) thereof by
amending such Insurance Contracts in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit S,_ and to take such other steps as may be necessary to obtain all
necessary Governmental Approvals related thereto, and, promptly upon
obtaining such approvals, to use its best efforts to cause the Company, as of
the Closing Date, to be exempt from the duty under Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act to file reports required by Section 13(a) of the Exchange
Act (the " _Company Deregistration_ ").

 



108 SECTION 5.27 _Bank Accounts_. To the extent any individual other than a
Business Employee at the Closing has authority to draw on or has access to
the bank, savings, deposit or custodial accounts and safe deposit boxes
maintained by the Acquired Companies, Seller and its Affiliates shall remove,
effective as of the Closing, such individualÂ’s authority unless otherwise
directed in writing by Buyer Parent.

SECTION 5.28 _Transition Services Agreements; Final Transaction Agreements_.
Other than with respect to the terms relating to the payment of amounts under
the Transition Services Agreement as contemplated thereby, between the date
hereof and the Closing, Seller and Buyer Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to
work together in good faith to (i) negotiate and complete the services
schedules to the Transition Services Agreement and (ii) negotiate the terms
of each other Transaction Agreement and other document required or
contemplated to be delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement that is not attached to this Agreement in substantially
final form, including all exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto, including
the LLC Agreement, the Investment Management Agreements and the Real Property
Transfer Agreements. The parties agree that the services schedules attached to
the form of Transition Services Agreement that is attached to this Agreement
indicate the scope and other terms of certain services that will be finalized
after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date. Such services shall be
sufficient to cause the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_
__ _ 3.22_ to be true and correct as of the Closing Date. As soon as
practicable following the date hereof, each of Seller and Buyer Parent shall
appoint a representative, who shall be the authorized representative of that
party and empowered to act on its behalf in connection with the Transition
Services Agreement and the matters described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.28_.
Each of Buyer Parent and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that its appointed representative, together with its functional leaders for
each transition service under the Transition Services Agreement, attend a
review meeting, in person or by telephone, within ten (10) Business
Days following the date hereof, and thereafter until the Closing, whether in
person or by telephone, on a weekly basis (or as the parties may mutually
agree, more frequently than a weekly basis) and at such places, times and
dates as the parties mutually agree, in order to finalize the services
schedules to the Transition Services Agreement. The parties shall endeavor to
resolve in good faith any disputes or conflict arising from or relating to the
details of the aforementioned services schedules and the other matters
described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.28_, failing which either party may submit
such dispute to Marc Rowan and Rodney O. Martin, Jr. for resolution prior to
Closing.

 

SECTION 5.29 _Release_. Seller (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates other
than the Acquired Companies) shall, and hereby does, effective as of the
Closing, release, waive and forever discharge each Acquired Company and each
of its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and representatives
from any and all actions, suits, debts, liens, sums of money,
accounts, judgments, claims and demands whatsoever, at law or in equity,
either in contract or in tort, whether known or unknown, on account of,
arising out of or relating to or resulting from any Contract, transaction,
event, circumstance, action, failure to act or occurrence of any sort or
type, whether known or unknown, and which occurred, existed, was taken or
expressly permitted prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 5.29_ shall release, waive or discharge any actions,
suits, debts, liens, sums of money, accounts, judgments, claims and demands
whatsoever, at law or in equity, either in contract or in tort, whether known
or unknown, on account of arising out of this Agreement, any
other Transaction Agreement, the Surplus Note or any of the Contracts
contemplated to survive the Closing as specifically set forth in Section 5.6
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



109 SECTION 5.30 _New Services Company_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use
its reasonable best efforts to form a wholly owned subsidiary corporation
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware for the sole purpose of
accepting the transfer of the employment relationships of the Covered
Employees immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.12_ (the " _Services Company_ "). Seller shall cause Services Company not
to conduct any business or perform any activities except activities relating
to its formation and activities it is contemplated to take under this
Agreement.

 

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) Services Company has not been formed as of
the date hereof, (ii) upon formation, Services Company shall be deemed an
"Acquired Company" hereunder, and (iii) within five (5) Business Days
following the date of formation of Services Company, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer Parent the information required to be disclosed in _Section_ __ _
3.2(a)_ with respect to an Acquired Company for Services Company.

 

(c) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide such information
and cooperation as is reasonably requested by Buyer Parent from time to time
(including claims history) to ensure that Services Company has all of the
systems and procedures in place as of the Closing in order to employ the
Covered Employees (e.g., establish a payroll system, employee benefit plans,
etc.) from and after the Closing.

SECTION 5.31 _Alternate Reinsurer_. Upon written notice delivered by Buyer
Parent to Seller prior to the filing of the Form A application referenced in
_Section 5.4(b)(i)_ , Reinsurer Parent, in its sole discretion, may elect to
offer to ALRe the opportunity to act as the reinsurer of the FA Contracts
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 5.31_. In the event ALRe so elects,
ALRe shall, operating from outside the United States, and in conformity with
its operating guidelines, negotiate and enter into agreements with the Company
and RLI substantially in the form as follows, with such changes as are
mutually acceptable to the relevant parties: (i) a modified coinsurance
agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit O_ (the " _Alternate Company FA Business
Reinsurance Agreement_ "); and (ii) a modified coinsurance agreement with
RLI, attached hereto as _Exhibit Q_ (the " _Alternate RLI FA Business
Reinsurance Agreement_ " and together with the Alternate Company FA Business
Reinsurance Agreement, the " _Alternate FA Business Reinsurance Agreements_
"). In the event of any such election, Reinsurer shall have no obligations
whatsoever under this Agreement or to enter into any Company FA Business
Reinsurance Agreement or the RLI Business Reinsurance Agreement, and, other
than in this Section 5.31, all references herein to the "Reinsurer" shall be
deemed a reference to ALRe, all references to the "FA Business Reinsurance
Agreements" shall be deemed a reference to the "Alternate FA
Business Reinsurance Agreements," all references to the "Company FA Business
Reinsurance Agreement" shall be deemed a reference to the "Alternate Company
FA Reinsurance Agreement," all references to the "RLI FA Business Reinsurance
Agreement" shall be deemed a reference to the "Alternate RLI FA Reinsurance
Agreement" and each Alternate FA Business Reinsurance Agreement shall be
deemed to be a "Transaction Agreement" hereunder. 

 



110  For the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall
be responsible for any direct or indirect out-of-pocket costs (including,
without limitation, any excise taxes, or other fees, expenses or costs)
related to the Alternate FA Business Reinsurance Agreements or the cession of
the FA Business to ALRe pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.31_ that are in
excess of the direct or indirect out-of-pocket costs that would reasonably
have been expected to be incurred had no election been made pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.31_.

 

SECTION 5.32 _FA Reinsurance Timing_. Upon written notice delivered by Buyer
Parent to Seller prior to the filing of the Form A application referenced in
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)(i)_, Reinsurer, in its sole discretion, may elect for
the reinsurance of the FA Business to be consummated after the Closing on the
Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt, whether it is consummated with the
Reinsurer or the Alternate Reinsurer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.31_). If
Reinsurer so elects, the transactions contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_
shall occur on the Closing Date after the Closing; _provided_ , ___however_
_,_ that the provisions of _Article II_ (including, without limitation, the
calculation of the items set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement and the
calculation of the amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_) shall be applied
as if the FA Business was reinsured to Reinsurer prior to the Closing as
described in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_.

 

SECTION 5.33 _Minimum DSL Net Capital Amount_.

 

(a) Prior to the date on which the Estimated Closing Statement is required to
be delivered, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, if necessary,
contribute to DSL an amount such that the Estimated DSL Net Capital Amount is
not less than the Minimum DSL Net Capital Amount; _provided_ , that in no
event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates be required to contribute more
than the sum of (i) $4,000,000 and (ii) the aggregate amount of any dividends
or distributions made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.33(b)_.

 

(b) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
approvals from FINRA and other applicable Governmental Entities to permit DSL
to pay one or more dividends or make one or more other distributions of
capital held by DSL to VRIAC such that, at the Effective Time, the Estimated
DSL Net Capital Amount will equal the Minimum DSL Net Capital Amount. Subject
to the receipt of such required approvals, Seller shall cause DSL to make such
dividends or other distributions to VRIAC prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) Prior to the final determination of the Final DSL Net Capital, Buyer
Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, make any dividend or
other distribution of capital from DSL. If the Final DSL Net Capital is
greater than the DSL Closing Payment, Buyer Parent shall use its best efforts,
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the final determination thereof
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, to cause DSL to (i) obtain all necessary
approvals (if any) from FINRA and other applicable Governmental Entities to
permit DSL to pay or make one or more dividends or other distributions of
excess capital held by DSL to its parent company in the amount of such excess
and (ii) after receipt of such regulatory approvals (if necessary), promptly
to pay or make such dividend or distribution. Promptly after any dividend or
distribution is paid or made by DSL, Buyer Parent shall, or shall cause Buyer
to, pay to Seller or its designee 100% of the amount of such dividend or
distribution as additional purchase price for the DSL Interests until the
total amount of payments pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.33(c)_ is equal
to the excess of the

 



111  Final DSL Net Capital over the DSL Closing Payment. Any such payment shall
be treated as an adjustment to the amount paid for the assets of DSL as
determined under  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_ for federal and applicable state
and local Tax purposes.

SECTION 5.34 _Capital Contribution_. Immediately after the Closing, Buyer
Parent shall contribute to the Company an amount of capital that may not be
less than zero and is at least equal to the Maximum Buyer Funding Amount
_minus_ the DSL Closing Payment.

 

SECTION 5.35 _Communications Plan_. Promptly following the date hereof, Seller
shall communicate the items set forth in the communications plan attached
hereto as _Schedule 5.35_ (the " _Communications Plan_ ") to each of the
Producers set forth therein (the " _Target Producers_ "). The parties shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in good faith in
connection with any correspondence with the Target Producers regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements following the date hereof. Following the date hereof and prior to
the Closing, Seller and Reinsurer Parent or its designee shall have conference
calls and in-person meetings no less frequently than quarterly to discuss
updates regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreement, monitor production from Target Producers and plan
to transition production to AAIA at the Closing. Each party shall not, and
shall cause each of their respective Affiliates not to, initiate any
communication with the Target Producers regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements other than
in accordance with the Communications Plan or as otherwise agreed by the
parties.

 

SECTION 5.36 _Tax Opinions_. The parties shall have received an opinion or
opinions of counsel reasonably acceptable to each of them with respect to
certain U.S. federal income Tax matters related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that if such opinion or opinions
have not been received on or prior to the Closing Date (such nonreceipt, a "
_Tax Event_ "), then Buyer Parent shall exercise its rights under each of the
Equity Commitment Letters and the Subscription Agreement to call additional
capital in an aggregate amount equal to the Tax Event Amount. The occurrence
of a Tax Event shall not result in or contribute to the failure of any of the
closing conditions in Article VI to be satisfied.

SECTION 5.37  _Investment Management Agreements_. The parties shall, in Buyer
ParentÂ’s discretion, work in good faith to obtain any desired consents to
assign or otherwise transfer any agreements with any Person set forth on
Section 5.37 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule (each, an " _Existing Third-
Party_ ") or to terminate such agreements. If any such agreements with
Existing Third-Parties continue after the Closing, any management fees and
performance compensation due to the Existing Third-Parties thereunder will be
borne by Buyer Parent or its Affiliates. Additionally, to the extent that any
existing agreement with an Existing Third-Party is terminated at the request
of Buyer as of or prior to Closing, any termination fees resulting from such
termination shall be split equally between Buyer Parent and Seller. If such
termination occurs prior to the Closing, without BuyerÂ’s consent, then such
termination fees shall be borne by Seller.

SECTION 7.3 _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) No party shall be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless its respective
Indemnitees under _Sections_ __ _ 7.2(a)(i)_ (in the case of Seller),
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)(i)_ (in the case of Buyer Parent) or _Section_ __ _
7.2(c)(i)_ (in the case of Reinsurer Parent) (i) with respect to any claim (or
series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or
circumstances), unless such claim (or series of related claims arising from
the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) involves Indemnifiable
Losses in excess of $100,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), (nor shall any
claim that does not exceed the Threshold Amount be applied to or considered
for purposes of calculating the amount of Indemnifiable Losses for which the
Indemnitor is responsible under clause (ii) below), (ii) unless and until the
aggregate amount of all Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitees under such
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(i)_ or such _Sections_ __ _ 7.2(b)(i)_ and _7.2(c)(i)_
 (which Indemnifiable Losses under _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)(i)_ and _7.2(c)(i)_
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the Deductible and the
Cap, each as defined below, have been exceeded), as the case may be, exceeds
$10,000,000 for all Indemnifiable Losses (the " _Deductible_ "), at which
point such Indemnitor shall be liable to its respective Indemnitees for the
value of the IndemniteeÂ’s claims under  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(i)_ or
_Sections_ __ _ 7.2(b)(i)_ and _7.2(c)(i)_ , as the case may be, that is in
excess of the Deductible, subject to the limitations set 

 



117  forth in this _Article_ __ _ VII_ and (iii) the maximum aggregate liability
of Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer Parent and Reinsurer Parent,
collectively, on the other hand, to their respective Indemnitees for any and
all Indemnifiable Losses under _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(i)_, in the case of
Seller, or _Sections_ __ _ 7.2(b)(i)_ and _7.2(c)(i)_ , in the case of Buyer
Parent and Reinsurer Parent shall be $125,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that (A) none of the Threshold Amount, the Deductible or the Cap
shall apply with respect to Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or resulting
from any breach or failure to be true of any Seller Specified Representation,
any Buyer Parent Specified Representation or any Reinsurer Parent Specified
Representation and such Indemnifiable Losses shall not be taken into account
in determining whether the Threshold Amount, the Deductible or the Cap have
been exceeded, (B) the Threshold Amount and the Deductible shall not apply to
Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or resulting from any breach or failure to
be true of the representation and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.22 (Sufficiency of Assets)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.30 (Tax Treatment of
Insurance Contracts)_ and such Indemnifiable Losses shall not be taken into
account in determining whether the Threshold Amount or the Deductible have
been exceeded and (C) except for Excluded Liabilities, the maximum aggregate
liability of Seller to all Buyer Indemnified Persons for any or all
Indemnifiable Losses under Section 7.2(a)(i) and 7.2(a)(ii) shall not exceed
$500,000,000. In the event Seller is required to make a payment in respect of
Indemnifiable Losses resulting from or arising out of breaches or failures to
be true of any representations or warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.30_ (Tax Treatment of Insurance Contracts), the Cap shall be increased by
the amount of such Indemnifiable Losses, up to a maximum of $20,000,000;
_provided_ that the maximum aggregate Liability of Seller with respect to
Liabilities other than those resulting from or arising out of any breach of _
Section_ __ _ 3.30_ (Tax Treatment of Insurance Contracts) shall continue to
be as described above (and not increased by this sentence), and all other
applicable limitations set forth in this Article VII shall apply with respect
to Indemnifiable Losses resulting from or arising out of a breach or failure
to be true of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.30_ (Tax Treatment of Insurance Contracts).

(b) If any Indemnitee actually recognizes a Tax benefit in respect of an
Indemnifiable Loss as described in the proviso in the definition of
"Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.4(d)_ subsequent to an
Indemnity Payment made by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee with respect to such
Indemnifiable Loss, then such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitor
the amount of such Tax benefit recognized by such Indemnitee up to the amount
of such Indemnity Payment received by the Indemnitee, net of any expenses
incurred by such Indemnitee in pursuing such Tax benefit, within fifteen (15)
days after the Indemnitee recognizes such Tax benefit in the form of cash
actually received or reduction in cash Taxes actually paid. If any Tax
benefit (or portion thereof) in respect of an Indemnifiable Loss as described
in the proviso in the definition of "Indemnifiable Losses" set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.4(d)_, that either (i) reduces the Indemnity Payments made
by an Indemnitor prior to the time such payment is made or (ii) obligates an
Indemnitee to make payments to the Indemnitor under the immediately preceding
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, is disallowed as a result of an
audit or otherwise, the applicable Indemnitor shall promptly pay to the
applicable Indemnitee the amount of such disallowed Tax benefit within thirty
(30) days after the Indemnitee notifies the Indemnitor that the adjustment
with respect to such disallowance has been paid or otherwise taken into
account.

(c) Each Indemnitee shall use reasonable best efforts to mitigate
all Indemnifiable Losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder,
including by using reasonable best efforts to collect the maximum amount
recoverable with respect thereto under any insurance or reinsurance coverage
or other applicable source of recovery.

SECTION 7.5 _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor
may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in
no event later than thirty (30) days after becoming aware) thereof (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") and such Claim Notice shall include a reasonable
description of the claim and any documents relating to the claim and an
estimate of the Indemnifiable Loss to the extent known and shall reference the
specific sections of this Agreement that form the basis of such claim;
_provided_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying any
Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation or otherwise
affect the rights of any Indemnitee hereunder unless (and then solely to the
extent) the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by such delay. Thereafter, the
Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within five (5) calendar days
after the IndemniteeÂ’s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third
Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses by giving written notice to the
Indemnitee within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Claim Notice with
respect to such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the Indemnitor and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party
and at the IndemnitorÂ’s expense. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not as long as it
conducts such defense be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Indemnitee concludes based on
the advice of outside counsel that a conflict in interest between the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitee exists with respect to such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitor shall be liable for the reasonable out-of-pocket legal
expenses of one counsel that are incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with
the defense thereof. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_, the Indemnitee shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood
that the Indemnitor shall control such defense. The Indemnitor shall be liable
for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee for
any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense
thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnitee shall have not
yet given notice of the Third-Party Claim as provided

 



120  above). If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third-Party Claim, the
parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the IndemnitorÂ’s request) the provision to
the Indemnitor of records and information that are relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect
to, or pay, settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim
without the IndemnitorÂ’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnitor has assumed
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor may only pay, settle,
compromise or discharge a Third Party Claim with the IndemniteeÂ’s prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed); _provided_ , that the Indemnitor may pay, settle, compromise or
discharge such a Third Party Claim without the written consent of the
Indemnitee if such settlement (A) includes a complete and unconditional
release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim, (B) does not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy, and (C) does not include a statement or admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnitee. If the
Indemnitor submits to the Indemnitee a bona fide settlement offer that
satisfies the requirements set forth in the proviso of the immediately
preceding sentence and the Indemnitee refuses to consent to such settlement,
then thereafter the IndemnitorÂ’s liability to the Indemnitee with respect to
such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the sum of (x) the IndemnitorÂ’s
portion of the settlement amount included in such settlement offer and (y) the
amount of expenses incurred by the Indemnitee prior to the time of and in
connection with the proposed settlement to which it is entitled to
indemnification, and the Indemnitee shall either assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim or pay the IndemnitorÂ’s attorneyÂ’s fees and other out-of-
pocket costs incurred thereafter in continuing the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_,
the Indemnitee (and not the Indemnitor) shall have the exclusive right to
assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim, if (I) the Indemnitee
in good faith determines that the nature of the Third Party Claim is such that
it would reasonably be expected to involve criminal liability being imposed
on the Indemnitee or its Affiliates or (II) such Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnitee that the
Indemnitee reasonably determines, after consultation with its outside
counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages;
_provided_ that if such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnitee that can be separated from a related claim for
money damages, the Indemnitor may only be entitled to assume control of the
defense of such Third Party Claim for money damages.

(c)

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall
have the sole right to represent the interests of the Acquired Companies, and
to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, in any audit or other
examination or administrative or court proceeding relating to (i) Taxes for
any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, for any Straddle Period,
in each case for which Seller could be liable under _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and
(ii) Taxes described in _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)(vi)_; _provided_ , that Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts in representing the interests of
the Acquired Companies, and

 



121  shall not pay, discharge, settle, compromise, litigate, or otherwise dispose
of any item subject to such Tax proceedings (i) relating to a Straddle Period
or (ii) in a manner that could be reasonably expected to result in a post-
Closing increase in Tax for which Seller would not be liable under _Section_
__ _ 8.1_ without obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to SellerÂ’s rights set forth in the
preceding sentence, Buyer Parent shall be entitled, at its expense, to
participate in the conduct of any Tax audit and any judicial or
administrative proceeding relating to any such Tax audit.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer Parent
shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the Acquired
Companies, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, in any audit or
other examination or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes
for any Tax period that begins after the Closing Date other than proceedings
subject to control by Seller under _Section_ __ _ 7.5(c)(i)_; _provided_ ,
that Buyer Parent shall not pay, discharge, settle, compromise, litigate,
or otherwise dispose of any item subject to such Tax proceedings for which
Seller could reasonably expected to be liable under _Section_ __ _ 8.1_
without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and subject to Buyer ParentÂ’s rights set forth in the preceding
sentence, Seller shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in the
conduct of any Tax audit and any judicial or administrative proceeding
relating to any such Tax audit.

SECTION 7.6 _Direct Claims_. The Indemnitor will have a period of thirty (30)
days within which to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on
account of an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30 day period, the
Indemnitor will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the
Indemnitee will be entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnitee. The foregoing does not apply with respect to a breach or alleged
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.30_,
which will be governed by the terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.9_.

 

SECTION 7.7 _Sole Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
except (i) equitable remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law, (ii)
in the event that a party is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have willfully and knowingly committed a fraud, with the
intent to deceive or mislead any other party, regarding such
partyÂ’s representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth
in this Agreement or in any certificate furnished in connection with the
Closing, (iii) as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.7(b)_ or (iv) as
otherwise specifically provided herein or in any other Transaction Agreement,
if the Closing occurs, their sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing
with respect to any and all claims for monetary relief arising out of or
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be pursuant
to the provisions set forth in this _Article_ __ _ VII_ or _Article_ __ _
VIII_, as applicable.

 



122 SECTION 7.8 _Certain Other Matters_.

 

(a) Upon making any Indemnity Payment, Indemnitor will, to the extent of such
Indemnity Payment, be subrogated to all rights of Indemnitee against any
third Person (other than any Tax authority or any Affiliate of the Indemnitee,
including the Acquired Companies) in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to
which the Indemnity Payment related. Without limiting the generality or effect
of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will duly
execute upon request and at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described
subrogation rights. 

(b) The rights and remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall in no way
be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts or circumstances upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach
is based may also be the subject matter of any other representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach.
The representations, warranties and covenants of Seller, and the Buyer
Indemnified PersonsÂ’ rights to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not
be affected or deemed waived by reason of (and the Buyer Indemnified Persons
shall be deemed to have relied upon the representations and warranties of
Seller set forth herein notwithstanding) (i) any investigation made by or on
behalf of any of the Buyer Indemnified Persons (including by any of its
Representatives) or by reason of the fact that any of the Buyer Indemnified
Persons or any of such Representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate, regardless of
whether such investigation was made or such knowledge was obtained before or
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or (ii) Buyer ParentÂ’s
waiver of any condition set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_. The
representations, warranties and covenants of Buyer Parent, and the Seller
Indemnified PersonsÂ’ rights to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not
be affected or deemed waived by reason of (and the Seller Indemnified Persons
shall be deemed to have relied upon the representations and warranties of
Buyer Parent set forth herein notwithstanding) (i) any investigation made by
or on behalf of any of the Seller Indemnified Persons (including by any of its
Representatives) or by reason of the fact that any of the Seller Indemnified
Persons or any of such Representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate, regardless of
whether such investigation was made or such knowledge was obtained before or
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or (ii) SellerÂ’s waiver of
any condition set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any claim for
indemnification based on an actual or alleged breach or failure to be true of
any representation or warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.28_ must be
brought in the context of, and will be resolved pursuant to, the dispute
resolution mechanics set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ with respect to the
finalization of the Final Closing Statement and the related calculations.
After the Final Closing Statement has become final and binding on the parties
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, except for (i) equitable remedies
that cannot be waived as a matter of law or (ii) in the event that a party is
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have willfully and
knowingly committed a fraud, with the intent to deceive or mislead any other
party, regarding such representations and warranties, Seller and its
Affiliates shall have no further Liability to any Buyer Indemnified Person for
any Indemnifiable Loss or other Liability resulting from or arising out of
any breach or failure to be true of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.28_.

 



123 SECTION 7.9 _Policy Tax Claims_.

 

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Persons may bring a claim pursuant to _Section
7.2(a)_ that relates to a breach of a representation or warranty under
_Section 3.30_, even if no related Third Party Claim has first been asserted
or made against the applicable Indemnified Party with respect thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such claim with respect to which no Third
Party Claim has previously been asserted (a " _Direct Product Tax Claim_ ")
must be based on the reasonable and good faith determination by the applicable
Indemnified Party that a breach of a representation or warranty under 
_Section 3.30_ has occurred. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 7.9_ shall, unless specifically provided herein, limit or otherwise
restrict the right of any Buyer Indemnified Person to be indemnified under
this  _Article VII_ for Indemnifiable Losses incurred, and for which a valid
notice for indemnification was delivered, prior to the end of the survival
period specified in _Section 7.1(a)_ with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.30_.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss with
respect to any claim for indemnification with respect to a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.30_ shall include,
without limitation, costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the applicable
Indemnified Party to correct or repair any information technology to avoid a
recurrence of the circumstances that provided the basis for such claim
(provided such circumstances would reasonably be expected to arise with
respect to the administration of policies or contracts administered as of the
Closing Date).

(c) If any Buyer Indemnified Person brings a Direct Product Tax Claim, Seller
and the applicable Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith to
determine whether any breach of a representation or warranty under _Section_
__ _ 3.30_ has occurred and, if necessary, to develop corrective measures
that are reasonable, practical, cost effective and efficacious, taking into
account all of the relevant facts and circumstances then applicable. If, with
respect to a Direct Product Tax Claim, Seller and the applicable Indemnified
Party cannot agree as to whether a breach of a representation or warranty
under _Section_ __ _ 3.30_ has occurred, then (i) if Seller promptly (and in
any event within 30 Business Days) after receiving a Claim Notice with respect
to such Direct Product Tax Claim delivers or causes to be delivered to the
applicable Indemnified Party an opinion addressed to such Indemnified Party
and issued by a reputable nationally recognized law firm, accounting firm or
actuarial firm that is familiar with analyzing matters of the type covered by
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.30_ to the
effect that it is more likely than not that no such breach has occurred with
respect to the Direct Product Tax Claim then in dispute, then (A) Seller
shall not be required to indemnify the applicable Indemnified Party with
respect to such disputed Direct Product Tax Claim, unless and until either a
Third Party Claim with respect thereto subsequently arises, such opinion is
subsequently withdrawn or qualified, the parties otherwise agree that such
opinion is no longer controlling or such opinion is not subsequently
reaffirmed or re-issued promptly upon the reasonable request by such
Indemnified Party (other than as a result of a change in applicable Law) and
(B) Seller shall, as provided under _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_, indemnify the
applicable Indemnified Party for any Indemnifiable Losses attributable to a
breach of a representation or warranty under _Section_ __ _ 3.30_ (including
any penalties

 



124  or fees imposed by the IRS) arising out of or relating to any inaccuracy or
incorrect conclusion set forth in such opinion or any delay in remediating the
matter to which such Direct Product Tax Claim relates in reliance on such
opinion and (ii) if Seller does not deliver or cause to be delivered to the
applicable Indemnified Party any such opinion within such 30-Business Day
period, then such breach of a representation or warranty set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.30_ that is alleged by such Indemnified Party shall be
deemed conclusively to have been established with respect to such Direct
Product Tax Claim. If Seller and the applicable Indemnified Party cannot
agree with respect to the appropriate reasonable, practical, cost-effective
and efficacious corrective measures, the disagreement shall be resolved by a
recognized law firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm mutually agreeable to
the applicable Indemnified Party and Seller, and any such determination by
such law firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm shall be final. Such law
firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm shall render a determination
within sixty days of the referral of such matter for resolution. The cost of
engaging a law firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.9(c)_ shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by the applicable
Indemnified Party.

(d) In the event that the corrective measures described in this _Section_ __ _
7.9_ with respect to any claim for indemnification for breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.30_ include making
any request to the IRS for relief with respect to such failure, the applicable
Indemnified Party and Seller shall jointly participate in all discussions or
other proceedings with the IRS, including attendance at meetings and joint
approval of all written submissions. Seller shall control the decision of
whether or not to enter into a closing agreement or other arrangement with
the IRS in connection with such discussions or other proceedings; _provided_ ,
that, if the closing agreement or other arrangement involves any admission
that would reasonably be expected to form the basis of the determination of
any future liability of the applicable Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, or any nonmonetary relief against or commitments by such
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, or otherwise restricts the future
activity or conduct of such Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, then
Seller may not enter into any such closing agreement or other arrangement
without such Indemnified PartyÂ’s prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Should the applicable
Indemnified Party decide to withhold its consent to SellerÂ’s entering into any
closing agreement or other arrangement with the IRS, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly communicate such decision in writing to Seller. Seller shall
direct the Buyer Indemnified Persons to implement the appropriate corrective
measures described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_, and Buyer Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to implement such measures at SellerÂ’s
direction and not take any actions that would contradict any such reasonable
directions.

(e) For purposes of  _Sections 7.2(a)_ and _7.9_ , breaches of a
representation or warranty under _Section_ __ _ 3.30_ will be determined
without regard to any matter included in Section 3.30 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

 



125 ARTICLE VIII

 

TAX MATTERS

SECTION 8.1  _Indemnification for Taxes_.

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons
from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent resulting
from or arising out of the following:

(i) Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company, or for which any Acquired Company
may otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a member of a Seller Group
prior to the Closing (including Taxes for which any Acquired Company may be
liable pursuant to Treasury Regulation Â§ 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of
state, local or foreign law as a result of having been a member of a Seller
Group);

 

(ii) Taxes with respect to any Acquired Company for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods,

 

(iii) Taxes arising out of the Pre-Sale Transactions;

 

(iv) Taxes arising out of a breach or inaccuracy of the Surviving Tax
Representations, other than any such breach or inaccuracy that is
attributable to a retroactive change in Applicable Law between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date;

 

(v) Taxes arising out of a breach of any covenant of Seller or its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies, prior to the Closing Date) under _Article_
__ _ V_ or this _Article_ __ _ VIII_, other than any such breach that is
attributable to a retroactive change in Applicable Law between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date;

(vi) Taxes imposed on Buyer Parent or its Affiliates after the Closing arising
out of (i) any limitation or disallowance under Section 382 or 383 of the
Code of any items of deduction or loss arising out of the Retained Hedge
Losses or (ii) the Buyer Parent or its Affiliates (including the Company) not
being able to utilize or recognize losses or deductions arising from the
Retained Hedge Losses after the Closing as a result of the acceleration into
current deductions or losses of the Retained Hedge Losses as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , (i) Seller shall not be liable for any Tax liability
to the extent such Tax liability is taken into account in Total Adjusted Book
Value and (ii) in the event Buyer Parent elects for the reinsurance of the FA
Business to occur after the Closing, the transactions contemplated by the FA
Business Reinsurance Agreements shall not be treated as Pre-Sale Transactions.

 



126 (b) Buyer Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified
Persons from and against any and all liabilities for Taxes that are not
subject to indemnification by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_ to
the extent resulting from or arising out of:

 

(i) Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company for all Post-Closing Tax Periods;

 

(ii) Taxes arising out of a breach of any covenant of Buyer Parent under this
_Article_ __ _ VIII_.

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
in the following manner:

 

(i) in the case of Taxes based on or measured by income, gain, or receipts, or
related to the actual or deemed sale or transfer of property, or which are
withholding Taxes, such Taxes shall be allocated based on an interim closing
of the books as of the end of the Closing Date; and

 

(ii) in the case of Taxes calculated on a periodic basis, the portion of such
Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount
of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period _multiplied by_ a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

(iii) With respect to any partnership interest owned by an Acquired Company
through a separate account, the items of income, gain, deduction, or loss
arising from such partnership interest shall be allocated between the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period in a manner that matches,
as closely as reasonably practicable, the changes to the corresponding
separate account reserves pursuant to Section 817 of the Code. With respect
to any other partnership interest owned by an Acquired Company, the items of
income, gain, deduction, or loss arising from such partnership interest shall
be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period on a ratable basis consistent with the principles of _Section_ __ _
8.1(a)(c)(ii)_.

 

(iv) In the event Buyer Parent elects for the reinsurance of the FA Business
to occur after the Closing on the Closing Date, the Tax consequences of such
transactions shall be allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Seller Indemnified
Persons shall not be liable for (and Buyer Parent shall indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Persons against) any Taxes resulting from any transaction or event
that is outside the ordinary course of business and occurs after the Closing
but on the Closing Date, unless such transaction or event is initiated by
Seller or either Acquired Company before the Closing or occurs pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

 



127 SECTION 8.2 _Filing of Tax Returns_.

 

(a)

(i) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Consolidated Returns that include any Acquired Company, regardless
of when such Tax Returns are required to be filed.

 

(ii) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies for taxable periods that
end on or before the Closing Date and that are required to be filed prior to
the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions) other than Tax Returns
described in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_. Seller shall remit any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns.

(iii) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, (A) all Tax Returns for
the Acquired Companies for taxable periods that end on or before the Closing
Date and that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (taking into
account any extensions) and (B) all Tax Returns for any Straddle Period, in
each case other than Tax Returns described in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_.
Seller shall deliver any such Tax Return to Buyer Parent for Buyer ParentÂ’s
review at least thirty (30) days (or, in the case of premium Tax Returns,
ten (10) days) prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed and
(i) in the case of any Tax Return relating to a Straddle Period, shall accept
all reasonable comments of Buyer Parent in respect of such Tax Returns made
prior to the date that is three days prior to the due date of such Tax
Return, to the extent consistent with Applicable Law and prior practice of the
relevant Acquired Company, and (ii) in the case of any Tax Return relating to
a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, shall consider in good
faith making any changes to such Tax Return reasonably requested by Buyer
Parent. To the extent consistent with Applicable Law, Buyer Parent shall, or
shall cause the Acquired Companies to, file all Tax Returns for any Straddle
Period on the basis that the relevant Tax period ended as of the Closing Date,
unless the relevant Tax Authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on that
basis. Buyer Parent shall file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns
described in clause (A) or (B) hereof consistent within this _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)(iii)_.

 

(iv) From and after the Closing, upon reasonable request of Seller, Buyer
Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies to provide Seller and its
Affiliates in a timely fashion in accordance with past practice all filing
information relating to the Acquired Companies reasonably necessary for the
preparation and filing of the Consolidated Returns for taxable years or
periods beginning before the Closing Date or any Tax Return described in
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(iii)_. Seller shall compensate the Acquired Companies
for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with providing the
foregoing.

 

(v) All Tax Returns that Seller is required to file or cause to be filed in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ shall be prepared and filed in
a

 



128  manner consistent with past practice and with respect to ordinary course
positions, no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in
preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods (including
positions, elections or methods that would have the effect of deferring income
to periods ending after the Closing Date or accelerating deductions to
periods ending on or before the Closing Date), other than to the extent (i)
required as a result of a change in Applicable Law, (ii) any such change from
past practices, positions, elections or methods would not be reasonably
expected to materially adversely affect an Acquired Company or (iii) Seller
has obtained Buyer ParentÂ’s prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limitation of the
foregoing, Seller shall not take any position on any Tax Return required to
be filed by it after the date hereof (whether originally filed or filed on an
amended return) to the effect that the deferred losses from hedges of
liabilities that are being taken into account under the agreed upon mark and
spread method of accounting by the Company accelerate into current deductions
or losses as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(vi) In the event that, as a result of a change in Applicable Law occurring
after the date hereof, with respect to a Tax Return required to be filed by
Seller pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, Seller is required to take a
position for which there is no prior practice, make an election or select a
method for the first time that is reasonably expected to materially adversely
affect an Acquired Company, Seller shall consult with Buyer Parent prior to
taking such position, making such election or selecting such method and shall
not do so without Buyer ParentÂ’s prior written consent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b) Unless required by Applicable Law, Buyer Parent shall not, and
shall cause the Acquired Companies to not, take any action on or after the
Closing Date (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) that
could be reasonably expected to result in an increased Tax of an Acquired
Company attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or an indemnity obligation
(or increase in an indemnity obligation) of Seller under _Section_ __ _
8.1(a)_, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limitation of
the foregoing, unless required by a final determination Buyer Parent shall
not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to not, take any position to the
effect that any items of deductions or loss attributable to Retained Hedge
Losses accelerate into current deductions or losses as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or are limited or disallowed under
Section 382 or 383 of the Code.

 

(c) Except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law, Buyer Parent
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, amend any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies
relating in whole or in part to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(d) Each of Seller and Buyer shall reimburse the other party, as applicable,
for the Taxes for which Seller or Buyer, as applicable, is liable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, but which

 



129  are remitted in respect of any Tax Return to be filed by the other party
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ upon the written request of the party
entitled to reimbursement setting forth in detail the computation of the
amount owed by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, but in no event earlier
than ten (10) days prior to the due date for paying such Taxes.

 

SECTION 8.3 _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund, credit, or similar benefit
(including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) (a " _Tax
Refund_ ") relating to the Acquired Companies for Taxes paid for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be the property of Seller; _provided_ , _however_ ,
to the extent such Tax Refund arises from the carryback of an item of
deduction or loss from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or was taken into account in Total Adjusted Book Value, such Tax Refund shall
be property of Buyer Parent. If received by Buyer Parent or either Acquired
Company, Buyer Parent shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to, pay
such Tax Refund to which Seller is entitled under this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_
promptly to Seller, net of any Tax cost to Buyer Parent or any of its
Affiliates attributable to the receipt of such refund. In the event that any
such Tax Refund is subsequently contested by any Tax Authority, such contest
shall be handled in accordance with the procedures in _Section_ __ _ 7.5_.
Any additional Taxes resulting from the contest shall be indemnified in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_.

 

SECTION 8.4 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Seller and Buyer Parent
shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of
them or their respective Affiliates may reasonably request of the other in
filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for Tax Refund, determining
a liability for Taxes or a right to a Tax Refund, or participating in or
conducting any contest in respect of Taxes (a " _Tax Contest_ "). Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by any
Tax Authority. Each party and its Affiliates shall make its employees
available on a basis mutually convenient to both parties to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder. Each of
Seller and Buyer Parent shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters
of the Acquired Companies for each Tax period first ending after the Closing
Date and for all prior Tax periods until the later of (i) the expiration of
the statute of limitations of the Tax period to which such Tax Returns and
other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent
notified in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods, or
(ii) three (3) years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax
Returns. Any information obtained under this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ shall be
kept confidential except as otherwise may be necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for Tax Refunds or in conducting a contest or
as otherwise may be required by Applicable Law or the rules of any stock
exchange.

 

SECTION 8.5 _Conveyance Taxes_. Buyer Parent or Seller, as appropriate, shall
execute and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the
other to comply with any filing requirements relating to any sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes ("
_Conveyance Taxes_ ") which become payable in connection with the purchase of
Shares or DSL Interests by Buyer Parent or the consummation of any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall file such
applications and documents as shall permit any Conveyance Taxes

 



130  to be assessed and paid. Any Conveyance Taxes incurred in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

SECTION 8.6  _Miscellaneous_.

(a) Each of Seller and Buyer Parent agrees that for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, each of the Pre-Sale Transactions shall be treated as occurring in
the taxable year of the period (or portion thereof) ending on the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event Buyer Parent elects for
the reinsurance of the FA Business to occur after the Closing on the Closing
Date, such transactions shall be treated as occurring on the day after the
Closing Date for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to the "next-day
rule" of Treasury Regulation Â§ 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

 

(b) Seller and Buyer Parent agree to treat all payments (other than interest
on a payment) made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other or
the otherÂ’s Affiliates or the Acquired Companies under this _Article_ __ _
VIII_ and under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement as adjustments to
(i) the amount in respect of the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the amount in respect of the purchase and sale of the
DSL Interests or Services Company contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the
Company Ceding Commission or (iv) the RLI Ceding Commission, as appropriate
in each case, for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof to the extent permissible under Applicable Law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Persons, as well as the obligations of Buyer Parent to indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Persons, pursuant to this _Article_ __ _
VIII_ shall terminate on the later of three months after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account any applicable
extensions or tollings thereof) with respect to the Tax liabilities in
question or sixty (60) days after the final administrative or judicial
determination of such Tax liabilities, except for any indemnity obligations
as to which a claim has been made before the expiration of the applicable
period.

(d) In the event of any Tax Contest, the conduct of the parties shall be
governed by the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.5_.

 

(e) Except for _Sections_ __ _ 7.3_, _7.4_ , _7.5_ and _7.7_ ,
indemnification under this Agreement for or with respect to any Taxes of the
Acquired Companies shall be provided exclusively in this _Article_ __ _ VIII_
and the provisions of _Article_ __ _ VII_ shall not apply. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ shall not apply
to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ VIII_, provided however, that (ii)
SellerÂ’s liability arising out of  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)(vi)_ shall not
exceed 21% of (A) the positive increase to the tax reserves in the deferred
variable annuity business which is the subject of the CBVA Recapture and
Amendment Agreement less (B) the absolute value of the decrease to the tax
reserves in the payout annuity business which is the subject of the CBVA
Recapture and Amendment Agreement, in each case as of January 1, 2018
resulting from Section 13517 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set forth in the
Conference Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2017 (or any substantially
similar provision of law).

 



131 (f) Should it be necessary, equitable adjustments will be made to prevent
duplicate recovery for indemnification with respect to the same item.

(g) Any Tax Sharing Arrangement entered into by Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller, on the one hand, and any Acquired Company, on the other hand, shall
be terminated as to each Acquired Company on or prior to the Closing, and
after the Closing the Acquired Companies shall not have any liability
thereunder.

 

(h) Seller will file or cause to be filed a "Section 1.1502-36 Statement" (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Â§ 1.1502-36(e)(5)) with the timely filed U.S.
federal consolidated income tax return for the consolidated group of which
Seller is a member for the consolidated tax return year that includes the
Closing Date substantially in the form of _Schedule_ __ _ 8.6(h)_ hereto
making a valid election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Â§
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) and (B) to (i) reattribute all or a portion of the tax
attributes of the Acquired Companies described in Treasury Regulation Â§
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B) immediately prior to the Closing other than the
following Category C attributes: (x) deferred losses from hedges of
liabilities that are being taken into account under the agreed upon mark and
spread method of accounting, as identified by Buyer at least 30 days prior to
the due date of the Tax Return to which such Section 1.1502-36 Statement will
be attached, in an amount not to exceed $1.066 billion (such attributes, the "
_Retained Hedge Losses_ "), (y) previously capitalized amounts pursuant to
Section 848 of the Code and (z) attributes arising from adjustments to tax
reserves that will be reflected as items of income or deduction after the
Closing Date pursuant to Section 807(f) of the Code or Section 13517 of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set forth in the Conference Agreement, dated as of
December 15, 2017 (or any substantially similar provision of law) and (ii) to
reduce membersÂ’ bases in shares of such Acquired Company by the excess of the
"attribute reduction amount" attributable to such Acquired Company over the
amount reattributed pursuant to clause (i) (the " _Section_ __ _ 1.1502-36
Election_"). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that (i) Seller
shall make the Section 1.1502-36 Election in whatever form is necessary to
avoid any reduction in the Category C Attributes referred to in clauses (x)
through (z) above and the Category D attributes of the Acquired Companies;
(ii) Seller shall reattribute to itself all deferred losses from hedges of
liabilities that are being taken into account under the agreed upon mark and
spread method of accounting in excess of the Retained Hedge Losses; and (iii)
Seller shall reattribute to itself all Category A and Category B attributes of
the Acquired Companies arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Seller will deliver a copy of the Section 1.1502-36 Statement
to Buyer Parent as soon as practicable following the filing of SellerÂ’s U.S.
federal consolidated Tax Return. Seller and its Affiliates will not take any
action that could be expected to result in a revocation of the Section
1.1502-36 Election.

 

(i) Neither Buyer Parent nor the Acquired Companies shall carryback to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period any item of loss, deduction or credit or any net operating
loss, net capital loss or other tax credit or benefit that is attributable to,
arises from or relates to any taxable period (or portion thereof) commencing
after the Closing Date; provided, however, that if Buyer is required under
Applicable Law to carryback any such item and is not permitted by Applicable
Law to waive such carryback, Buyer and Seller shall, reasonably and in good
faith (taking into 

 



132  account potential benefits and detriments to Seller, Buyer and their
respective Affiliates), consider any request by Buyer to amend a Tax Return
filed by or with respect to the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or take any other action reasonably required) in order to claim a Tax
refund or other reimbursement attributable to such carryback and will pay to
Buyer the net Tax benefits actually received by Parent, Seller or any of
their Affiliates that are associated with such carryback (as determined taking
into account (i) any costs, including any Taxes, attributable to the receipt
of such refund or other reimbursement and (ii) the effect of such carryback
on the Tax attributes of Parent, Seller and their Affiliates and any
limitations on use of those attributes).

 

(j)

(i) In the event that, as a result of a change in Applicable Law occurring
after the date hereof, (x) any of the representations and warranties made by
Seller in _Section_ __ _ 3.10_ become materially inaccurate or untrue
(without regard to any proviso or exception therein regarding changes in
Applicable Law), (y) Seller would be in breach of its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)(xiii)_ (without regard to any proviso or exception

any party from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, and such
order, injunction or decree shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

obligations under this Agreement, including, if applicable, its obligations
under this Agreement to contest such order, injunction or decree;

 



133 (b) by Seller or Buyer Parent in writing, if the Closing has not occurred on
or prior to October 1, 2018 (as it may be extended as contemplated below or

Outside Date either of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ has not been satisfied then, upon the written notice

(c) by either Seller or Buyer Parent (but only so long as Seller or Buyer
Parent, as applicable, is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement) in writing, if a breach of any provision of this Agreement
that has been committed by the other party, or, in addition, in the case of
Seller, by Reinsurer Parent, would cause the failure of any mutual condition
to Closing or any condition to Closing for the benefit of the non-breaching
party and such breach is not capable of being cured or is not cured within
twenty (20) days after the breaching party receives written notice from the
non-breaching party that the non-breaching party intends to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_;

 

(d) by Seller if (i) all of the conditions to the obligations of Buyer Parent

by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ , that such

(e) (i) by Seller, by written notice to Buyer Parent within two (2) Business
Days following the date on which the Closing would otherwise have occurred
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and has failed to occur for the second of any
two consecutive months due, in each such month, solely to the failure of the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ to be satisfied or waived by
Buyer Parent, and in each of such consecutive months Seller provided written
notice to Buyer Parent at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date on
which the Closing would otherwise have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2_ that all other conditions set forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied

Parent provided written notice to Seller at least one (1) Business Day prior
to the date on which the Closing would otherwise have occurred pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ that all other conditions set forth in _Article VI_ have
been satisfied or waived (other than those other conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) and requesting that Seller waive
the failure of the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_; or

 

(f) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer Parent.

 

SECTION 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no
further force and effect without liability of any party (or any Representative
of such party) to the other parties to this Agreement; _provided_ , that no
such termination shall relieve a party from liability for any fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section_ __
_ 1.1_ (as applicable), _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, _Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 5.24(b)_, this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ and _Article_ __ _ X_

SECTION 10.1  _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as provided below in this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ and as otherwise
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, _Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_, and _Section_ __
_ 5.24(b)_, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated, each party hereto shall, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, pay its own Transaction Expenses incident to preparing for,
entering into and carrying out the Transaction Agreements and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

(b) In the event Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _

Seller a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $105,000,000 (the " _Termination

Control Investor to comply with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ after the

_Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ and Buyer ParentÂ’s obligation to pay Seller the
Termination Fee pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)_ and (b) the

different events.

 



135 (c) In the event that Seller is entitled to receive the Termination Fee and
Buyer Parent fails to timely pay all or any portion of the Termination Fee
and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller commences an Action against Buyer
Parent and obtains a final judgment in SellerÂ’s favor, Buyer Parent shall
promptly reimburse Seller for all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred by Seller (including the reasonable and documented fees and expenses
of all attorneys, consultants and other experts retained by Seller) in
connection with collecting the Termination Fee up to a maximum of $3,000,000
(the " _Recovery Costs_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Buyer
Parent or Reinsurer Parent breaches this Agreement or fails to perform any of
its covenants, obligations or agreements hereunder (whether such breach or
failure is willful (including a Willful Breach), material, intentional,
unintentional or otherwise), the sole and exclusive remedies (whether such
remedies are sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
of Seller or any of its Affiliates against Buyer Parent, Reinsurer Parent, the
Investors and any of their respective Affiliates for any losses, damages,
costs, expenses, obligations or liabilities arising out of or resulting from
any breach or failure to perform their obligations under this Agreement (or
any breach of or failure to be true of any representation, warranty contained
in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, or any breach of any
covenant, obligation or agreement contained in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement) or any failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated, including the failure of any aspect of the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments, shall be (i) the right to
obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant
to and subject to the limitations of  _Section_ __ _ 10.7(b)_ and of the
Financing Commitments pursuant to the terms thereof; and (ii) SellerÂ’s right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ or  _Section_
__ _ 9.1(d)_ and (A) if this Agreement has been terminated in circumstances
in which the Termination Fee is payable, receive (1) the Termination Fee and
(2) all Recovery Costs in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_ or (B) if
this Agreement has been terminated in circumstances in which the Termination
Fee is not payable and (1) there has been any fraud by Buyer Parent with the
intent to deceive or mislead Seller regarding Buyer ParentÂ’s representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement or in
any certificate furnished in connection with the Closing or a Willful Breach
of this Agreement, recover monetary damages from Buyer Parent with respect to
such fraud or Willful Breach or (2) there has been a breach by Buyer Parent or
Reinsurer Parent of its covenant to reimburse Seller set forth in _Section_ __
_ 5.16(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.24_, recover monetary damages from Buyer
Parent or Reinsurer Parent, as applicable, resulting from or arising out of
such breach. Neither Buyer Parent nor Reinsurer Parent may avoid
responsibility for any portion of the Termination Fee, the Recovery Costs in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_ or damages recoverable from Buyer
Parent or Reinsurer Parent, in each case in circumstances in which such
amounts are payable or recoverable, as applicable, arising out of or
resulting from any breach or failure to perform by the other party, including
that it did not breach or fail to perform under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall any of Buyer, Buyer Parent, Reinsurer Parent, Reinsurer, any Investor
or any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers,
employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,

 



136  member, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Buyer Related Parties_ ") have any monetary liability or
obligations to Seller or any of SellerÂ’s Affiliates relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith (including
the Limited Guarantees or the Financing Commitments or any other Transaction
Agreement) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) in excess of an aggregate amount equal to
the sum of (x) the amount of the Termination Fee plus (y) the amount of the
Recovery Costs for which Buyer Parent is obligated to reimburse Seller in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_, and none of Seller, its Affiliates
or their respective representatives shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
Action against any Buyer Related Party arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (or the termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination except as provided in this _Section_
__ _ 10.1(d)_, against each Sponsor, under, as and when required pursuant to
the terms of the applicable Limited Guarantee, against Apollo, Reinsurer
Parent and AAIA for performance of their respective obligations to fund their
respective committed portions of the Financing solely in accordance with, and
pursuant to the terms and conditions of, the applicable Financing Commitment.
Buyer Parent and Seller acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and that, without these
agreements, Seller would not enter into this Agreement and that the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Seller in circumstances in which the
Termination Fee is paid for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating and seeking to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

(e) While Seller may pursue either a grant of specific performance in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.7(b)_ or the payment of the Termination Fee
and any Recovery Costs under _Sections_ __ _ 10.1(b)_ and _(c)_ , under no
circumstances will Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both (i) a grant
of specific performance to cause the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby following which the Closing occurs in accordance with
this Agreement and (ii) any portion of the Termination Fee.

SECTION 10.2 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and
other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be

SECTION 10.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or an
Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All
references herein to any agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation
are to the agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of
statutes, includes any rules and regulations promulgated under said statutes)
and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation including any successor
to said section. Any fact or item disclosed in any section of each of the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule and Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
disclosed in all other sections of such Disclosure Schedule to the extent the
applicability of such fact or item to such other section of such Disclosure
Schedule is reasonably apparent on its face. Disclosure of any item in the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule or Seller Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be,
shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material item,
fact, exception of fact, event or circumstance or that occurrence or non-
occurrence of any change or effect related to such item would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The word "or" shall not be exclusive except
where the context otherwise requires. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." Whenever the singular is used herein, the
same shall include the plural, and whenever the plural is used herein, the
same shall include the singular, where appropriate. Whenever the word
"Dollars" or the "$" sign appear in this Agreement, they shall be construed
to mean United States Dollars, and all transactions under this Agreement shall
be in United States Dollars. This Agreement has been fully negotiated by the
parties hereto and shall not be construed by any Governmental Entity against
either party by virtue of the fact that such party was the drafting party.

SECTION 10.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including all exhibits and schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements. Except
as set forth in (i) _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ with respect to the directors and
officers referred to therein and (ii) _Articles VII_ and _VIII_ with respect
to the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons, this
Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns any rights or
remedies.

 



139 SECTION 10.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute arising hereunder
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

SECTION 10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise (other than following the Closing by
operation of law in a merger), by either party without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any such assignment that is not consented to
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 10.7 _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any state
court, which in either case is located in the City of New York (each, a " _New
York Court_ ") for purposes of enforcing this Agreement or determining any
claim arising from or related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In any such action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way
of motion, as a defense or otherwise any claim that it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that such action, suit or other
proceeding is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that
such action, suit or other proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or
that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is improper;
_provided_ , that nothing set forth in this sentence shall prohibit any of the
parties hereto from removing any matter from one New York Court to another New
York Court. Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final and
unappealable judgment against a party hereto in connection with any action,
suit or other proceeding will be conclusive and binding on such party and that
such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A
certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment will be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment. Any process or
other paper to be served in connection with any action or proceeding under
this Agreement shall, if delivered or sent in accordance with _Section_ __ _
10.2_, constitute good, proper and sufficient service thereof.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, without the necessity of posting bond or other undertaking, the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement (including that
Seller shall be entitled to cause Buyer Parent and its Affiliates to enforce
their rights under the Financing Commitments or any definitive documents
relating to the Financing), this being in addition (subject to the terms of
this Agreement) to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or
in equity. In the event that any Action is brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall allege, and each party
hereto hereby waives any defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate
remedy at law. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party 

 



140  hereto brings any Action in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 10.7(b)_ to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by the
other party, the Outside Date shall be automatically extended (i) for the
period during which such action is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or
(ii) by such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action, as the case may be.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.7_.

SECTION 10.8 _Severability; Amendment; Modification; Waiver_.

(a) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been
contained herein.

(b) This Agreement may be amended or a provision hereof waived only by a
written instrument signed by each of Buyer Parent, Reinsurer Parent and Seller
in the case of an amendment, or in the case of a waiver, by the party hereto
entitled to make such a waiver.

 

(c) No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver
on the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

 

SECTION 10.9 _Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) Buyer Parent and Reinsurer Parent acknowledge and agree that neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), nor any
Representative of any of them, makes or has made, and Buyer Parent and
Reinsurer Parent have not relied on, any inducement or promise to Buyer Parent
or Reinsurer Parent except as specifically made in this Agreement or in any

and complete copies of any such documents having been provided to Buyer
Parent).

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Seller makes no express or implied
representation or warranty hereby or otherwise under this Agreement that the

reinsurance recoverables taken into account in determining the amount of such
reserves will be collectible.

thereon, has formed an independent judgment concerning the Acquired Companies

or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of, and that Buyer Parent,

delivered to the other parties. Each party may deliver its signed counterpart

contrary in this Agreement, (i) Buyer ParentÂ’s and Reinsurer ParentÂ’s
obligations under this Agreement shall be several, but not joint and several,

SECTION 10.13 _Attorney-Client Matters_.

 

(a) Recognizing that Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP (" _Willkie_ ") has acted as
legal counsel to Seller and certain of its Affiliates (including, prior to
the Closing, the Acquired Companies) prior to the date hereof, and that
Willkie intends to act as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates (which,
following the Closing, shall not include the Acquired Companies), the
Acquired Companies (i) hereby waive, on their own behalf and agree to cause
their controlled Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with Willkie representing Seller or its Affiliates after the
Closing with respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) shall not, and shall cause their controlled Affiliates not
to, seek to have or have Willkie disqualified from any such representation
based on the prior representation of the Acquired Companies by Willkie.

(b) The Acquired Companies further agree that all communications in any form
or format whatsoever between or among Willkie, Seller, or any of their
respective Representatives, that result from or arise out of the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Deal Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be retained and owned by Seller,
shall be controlled by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates. All Deal Communications that
are attorney-client privileged (the " _Privileged Deal Communications_ ")
shall remain privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely
to Seller, shall be controlled by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed
by the Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, Buyer Parent and its Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, Buyer Parent and its Subsidiaries) intentionally or inadvertently
come into possession of Privileged Deal Communications and in the event that
a 

 



143  dispute arises between the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and a third
party other than Seller, on the other hand, the Acquired Companies may assert
the attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged
Deal Communications to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Acquired Companies may not waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of Seller.

their respective duly authorized officers, all as of the date first written
above.
