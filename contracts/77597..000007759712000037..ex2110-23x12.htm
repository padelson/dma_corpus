AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 23, 2012,
by and among PolyOne Corporation, an Ohio corporation ("Parent"), 2012
RedHawk, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), 2012 RedHawk, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger LLC"), and Spartech Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent, and Merger
Sub, and the sole member of Merger LLC, have each determined that the
transactions described herein are in the best interests of their respective
companies and stockholders and, accordingly, the Board of Directors of the
Company and Parent have agreed to effect the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), whereby each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.75 per share, of the Company ("Company
Common Stock"), other than Dissenting Shares and any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent or held
in the treasury of the Company, will be converted into the right to receive
0.3167 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") and cash as provided in Section 2.1;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the Merger
is advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders;

WHEREAS, immediately following the Merger, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger to merge with and into Merger LLC (the "Subsequent
Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act
(the "LLC Act");

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (i) the
Merger and the Subsequent Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and the treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), and any comparable
provisions of state or local Law and (ii) this Agreement will be, and hereby
is, adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354, 361,
and 368 of the Code and Treasury Regulations, with the Merger and Subsequent
Merger constituting integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER AND THE SUBSEQUENT MERGER

Section 1.1 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company at the Effective Time, and the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub will thereupon cease. Following the Effective Time, the Company
will be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger,
the Subsequent Merger, the issuance by Parent of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger, the payment of cash consideration in connection
with the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
referred to herein as the "Transactions."

Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Transactions (the "Closing") will take
place at a time and on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, which is
to be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver by the party entitled to the
benefit thereof of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their terms,
cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the fulfillment or
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver by the party entitled to
the benefit of those conditions) set forth in Article VI, unless another time
or date is agreed to by the parties hereto. The Closing will be held at the
offices of Jones Day, 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, or such
other location to which the parties hereto agree in writing. The date on which
the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."

Section 1.3 Effective Time. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, (i) as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the
parties shall file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in
such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and the terms of this Agreement and (ii) as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger will become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date, or at such
subsequent date or time as the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth
in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will be vested in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.

(a) The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Company
Charter") shall be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before
the Effective Time, and, as so amended, such Company Charter shall be the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, will be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

Section 1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

Section 1.7 The Subsequent Merger.

(a) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to merge with and into Merger LLC, the separate corporate
existence of the Surviving Corporation will thereupon cease, Merger LLC will
continue as the surviving entity (the "Surviving Company"), and all of the
rights and obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement will
be deemed the rights and obligations of the Surviving Company. The Subsequent
Merger will have the effects set forth in Section 18-209(g) of the LLC Act.
Immediately following the completion of the Subsequent Merger, the Certificate
of Formation and Operating Agreement of the Surviving Company shall be in the
forms attached hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B, respectively.

(b) The Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, are intended to be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent and the Company are to be
parties under Section 368(b) of the Code).

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its affiliates to,
report the Merger and the Subsequent Merger for all Tax purposes consistent
with Section 1.7(b) unless required to do so otherwise by applicable Law.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) Merger Sub\'s Common Stock. Each share of Merger Sub\'s common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or any direct or indirect
subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
and any Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time will automatically be canceled and retired and
will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2(e), each issued
and outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting
Shares, will be converted into the right to receive (i) $2.67 in cash (the
"Cash Consideration") without interest and (ii) a number of validly issued,
fully paid, and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Consideration"). The Cash Consideration, the Stock
Consideration, and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by Section 2.2(e) are referred to collectively as the "Merger
Consideration."

(d) Cancellation of Shares of Company Common Stock. As of the Effective Time,
all shares of Company Common Stock, other than Dissenting Shares, shall no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing any
shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Certificate") or book entry shares
("Book-Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, certain dividends or
other distributions, if any, upon surrender of such Company Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, in each case, in accordance with this Article II, without
interest.

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a
national bank or trust company, that is reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, to act as agent of Parent for purposes of, among other things,
mailing and receiving transmittal letters and distributing the Merger
Consideration to the Company stockholders (the "Exchange Agent"). Parent and
the Exchange Agent shall enter into an agreement which will provide that
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent as of the Effective Time, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, (i) immediately
available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and (ii)
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (such cash and
such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time
and any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

(b) Exchange Procedures.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after, but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days following, the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Certificate or
Book-Entry Share whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which
will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company
Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and such
letter of transmittal will be in customary form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify consistent with this Agreement) and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates
or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(ii) After the Effective Time, and within five (5) Business Days upon
surrender in accordance with this Article II of a Company Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration in the form of (A) a certificate or book-entry share
representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II,
after taking into account all the shares of Company Common Stock then held by
such holder under all such Book-Entry Shares or Company Certificates so
surrendered and (B) a check for the full amount of cash that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, including
the Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, certain dividends
or other distributions, if any, in accordance with Section 2.2(c), and the
Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered will forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Company
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is 

registered (the "Transferee") if such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the
Transferee pays any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such payment
to a person other than the registered holder of such Company Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares or establishes to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Company Certificate and each Book-
Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that
the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Company
Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and certain
dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with Section 2.2(c).
No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II.

(c) Dividends; Other Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), and all such dividends, other
distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
will be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and will be included in the
Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Company Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such Company
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance herewith, there will be paid to
the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, in addition to all other
amounts to which such holder is entitled under this Article II (i) at the time
of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu
of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued and all Cash Consideration paid upon the surrender for
exchange of Company Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article
II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and Section 2.2(e))
will be deemed to have been issued or paid, as the case may be, in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Company Certificates and such Book-Entry
Shares, and there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(e) No Fractional Shares.

(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Parent will relate to
such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in
cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent and without interest) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which
such former holder would otherwise be entitled (rounded up to the nearest ten
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) by (B) the average closing price
for a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite
Transactions Reports (as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not
reported thereby, any other authoritative source) for the ten (10) consecutive
trading days ending with the fifth complete trading day prior to, but not
including, the Closing Date (the "Average Closing Price").

(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts to such holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock subject to and in accordance with
the terms of Section 2.2(c).

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time will be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II may thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration and
any dividends or distributions, if any, with respect to Parent Common Stock
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

(g) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, or the Exchange Agent will be
liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock, any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any cash from the Exchange Fund,
in each case, delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis,
provided, that, (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days, or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody\'s Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation,
respectively. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose,
except as provided in this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments will be paid to Parent.

(i) Lost Certificates. If any Company Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Certificate, the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid
dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect thereof and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, in each case, due to such person pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.3 Certain Adjustments. If at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of capital stock, of the Company or Parent shall occur
as a result of any merger, business combination, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration, the Exchange Ratio, the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, and any
other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to provide the holders of Company Common Stock
(or such rights that are convertible into shares of Company Common Stock) the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
provided that nothing in this Section 2.3 shall be construed to permit either
the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its respective
securities that is prohibited or not expressly permitted by the terms of this
Agreement. 

Section 2.4 Appraisal Rights. Shares of Company Common Stock that have not
been voted for adoption of this Agreement and with respect to which appraisal
has been properly demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
("Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration at or after the Effective Time unless and until the
holder of such shares (a "Dissenting Stockholder") withdraws such demand for
such appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or becomes
ineligible for such appraisal. If a holder of Dissenting Shares withdraws such
demand for appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or
becomes ineligible for such appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, each of such holder\'s
Dissenting Shares will cease to be a Dissenting Share and will be converted as
of the Effective Time into and represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments received by the Company relating to stockholders\'
rights of appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required
by applicable Law. The Company shall not, except with prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, unless and to the extent required to do so under applicable Law.

Section 2.5 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 2.6 Withholding Rights. The Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger LLC
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
(including pursuant to Section 5.4(g)) to any person such amounts, if any, as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger LLC or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such amounts withheld shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Merger LLC or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. Parent shall
pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so withheld to the appropriate
taxing authority within the period required under applicable Law.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Section 3.1 Representations and Warranties of the Company. Subject only to
those exceptions and qualifications listed and described (including an
identification by section reference to the representations and warranties to
which such exceptions and qualifications relate) on the disclosure letter
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the "Company Disclosure Letter"), provided, however, that a matter disclosed
in the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to one representation or
warranty shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect to each other
representation or warranty to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the
text of such disclosure that such disclosure relates to or qualifies such
other representation or warranty, and except as set forth in the Recent SEC
Reports (excluding any forward-looking statements, risk factors and other
similar statements in such Recent SEC Reports that are cautionary, non-
specific or predictive in nature), the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC as follows:

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. The Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized and has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be,
and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company and
each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such
concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have or result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of the
Company Charter and the bylaws of the Company, each as amended to date.

(b) Subsidiaries. All outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Company
Subsidiaries" and, together with the Company, the "Company Entities") (i) have
been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) are free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens and (iii) are free of any other
restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests). All outstanding
shares of capital stock (or equivalent equity interests of entities other than
corporations) of each of the Company Subsidiaries are beneficially owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company. The Company does not, directly or
indirectly, own more than 20% but less than 100% of the capital stock or other
equity interest in any person other than the Company Subsidiaries.

(c) Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
(i) 55,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) 4,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. At the close of business on

and outstanding (including 137,212 shares of unvested restricted stock under
the Company Stock Plan ("Company Restricted Shares")); (ii) 2,335,550 shares
of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury; (iii)

and the Spartech Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan (collectively, the
"Company Stock Plan"); (iv) 472,102 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved for issuance in respect of outstanding options to purchase Company
Common Stock under the Company Stock Plan ("Company Stock Options"); (v)
1,721,793 stock appreciation rights under the Company Stock Plan were
outstanding ("Company SARs"); (vi) 217,114 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved for issuance in respect of outstanding restricted stock units under
the Company Stock Plan ("Company RSUs"); and (vii) no shares of the Company\'s
preferred stock were issued and outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company are, and all shares that may be issued will be, when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to or issued in violation of preemptive rights. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 3.1(c), there are not issued, reserved for issuance
or outstanding (i) any shares of capital stock or other voting securities of
the Company, (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, or (iii) any warrants, calls, options or other rights
to acquire from the Company or any Company Subsidiary any capital stock,
voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.1(c), there
are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to (i)
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any capital
stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or (ii) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
securities. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
voting agreement with respect to the voting of any such securities. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 3.1(c) and for payments under Company
Benefit Plans, there are no agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character (contingent or otherwise) pursuant to which any person is or may be
entitled to receive from the Company or a Company Subsidiary any payment based
on the revenues, earnings or financial performance of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or assets or calculated in accordance therewith. The
Company does not have a "poison pill" or similar stockholder rights plan. The
Company has made available to Parent a list (the "Equity Award List"), as of
the close of 

business on October 19, 2012, of the holders of Company Stock Options, Company
SARs, Company RSUs and Company Restricted Shares, including the name of the
holder, the number of shares outstanding, the vesting schedule and other
forfeiture provisions and, with respect to Company Stock Options and Company
SARs, the exercise price or base price and the number of shares exercisable.
The Company will make available to Parent, no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, an updated Equity Award List,
current as of the date which is ten (10) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date.

(d) Authority; Noncontravention. The Company has all requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to the Company
Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions. Subject, in the case of
the Merger, to the Company Stockholder Approval, the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company, including the adoption by the Board of Directors of
the Company of resolutions (i) approving the Merger and the other
Transactions, and (ii) determining that in its judgment the terms of the
Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC, constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
generally affecting the rights of creditors and subject to general equity
principles. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement will not, (i) conflict with the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws (or comparable organizational documents) of any of the Company Entities,
(ii) assuming that all the consents, approvals and filings referred to in the
next sentence are duly obtained and/or made, (A) result in any breach,
violation or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,
or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or creation or
acceleration of any material obligation or material right of a third party or
loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon
any of the material properties or material assets of any of the Company
Entities under, any material loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease or other material agreement, instrument, permit, concession,

Entities or their respective properties or assets or (B) conflict with or
violate any judgment, order, decree or Law applicable to any of the Company
Entities or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
clause (ii)(A) and (B), any such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults,
rights, losses or Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have or result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.
No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in respect of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state or local or
foreign government, any court, administrative, regulatory or other
governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-governmental United
States or foreign self-regulatory agency, commission or authority or any
arbitral tribunal (each, a "Governmental Entity") or any third party is
required by the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions, except for: (i) the filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") of (A) a proxy statement/prospectus relating to the
Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement/prospectus, as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy Statement") and (B) such reports
under Section 13(a), 13(d), 15(d) or 16(a) or such other applicable sections
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as
may be required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions; (ii)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the

form by the Company under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"); (iv) notifications to the NYSE; and (v) such

or obtained, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) SEC Reports and Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal
Controls.

(i) The Company has timely filed all required reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other information
incorporated therein) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act") and the Exchange Act with the SEC since October 30, 2010 (as
such reports, schedules, forms, statements and documents have been amended
since the time of their filing, collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). As
of their respective dates, or if amended prior to the date of this Agreement,
as of the date of the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of
the Company SEC Documents when filed, or as so amended, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC staff.

(ii) The financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents comply as to form, as of their respective date of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted
by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and on that basis
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders\' equity for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal recurring year-end audit adjustments). No Company Subsidiary is
required to make any filings with the SEC. Except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Documents filed since October 30, 2010 and prior to the date of this
Agreement (the "Recent SEC Reports"), since October 30, 2010, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities (direct, contingent
or otherwise), that are of a nature that would be required to be disclosed on
a balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or the footnotes
thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than (A) liabilities incurred
in the ordinary course of business, and (B) liabilities that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have or
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(iii) As and to the extent described in the Company SEC Documents, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP. The Company (A) has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the
Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the
management of the Company by others within those entities, and (B) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
the Company\'s auditors and the audit committee of the Company\'s Board of
Directors (1) any significant deficiencies or material weakness in the design
or operation of internal controls which would adversely affect in any material
respect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company\'s
internal controls. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any
such disclosure made by Company management to the Company\'s auditors or audit
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and copies of any "audit
response letters" received from the Company\'s legal counsel, in each case,
during the past three years.

(f) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the "Form
S-4") will, at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, or (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first
mailed to the Company\'s stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all

the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted, except
where such violations, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and

other bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive
compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, equity
compensation, retirement, vacation, employment, disability, death benefit,
hospitalization, medical insurance, life insurance, welfare, severance, change

understanding (whether written or oral, qualified or nonqualified, funded or
unfunded, foreign or domestic), in each case which is sponsored, maintained or
contributed to, or required to be contributed to, by the Company or any trade
or business, whether or not incorporated, which, together with the Company,
would be deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
4001(b) of ERISA or Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code (a "Company ERISA
Affiliate") in respect of any current or former employees, officers,
directors, consultants or independent contractors of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans"). Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any material liability (including
material contingent liability) with respect to any plan, agreement,
arrangement or understanding of the type described in this paragraph other
than the Company Benefit Plans.

(ii) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered or
made available to Parent a true and complete copy of: (A) each writing
constituting a part of such Company Benefit Plan (or a written description
thereof if such Company Benefit Plan is not in writing), including all Company
Benefit Plan documents, trust agreements, insurance contracts and other
documents relating to the funding or payment of benefits; (B) the most recent
Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules, annual financial
reports and actuarial reports, if any; (C) the most recent determination or
opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), if any; (D) each
current summary plan description and summary of material modifications, if
any; and (E) any other materials relating to any Company Benefit Plan
reasonably requested by Parent.

(iii) Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained, operated and administered
in material compliance with its terms, all applicable Laws, and the terms of
all applicable collective bargaining agreements. There is no pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened assessment, complaint, proceeding, or
investigation of any kind in any court or Governmental Entity with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), nor to the
knowledge of the Company is there any basis for one. The Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company ERISA Affiliates have reserved all rights
necessary to amend or terminate each of the material Company Benefit Plans
without the consent of any other person, except to the extent any such consent
is explicitly set forth by the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan.

(iv) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter
from the IRS as to its qualified status and each trust created thereunder has

qualified status under Section 501(a) of the Code, and to the knowledge of the
Company, there exist no facts or circumstances that have caused or could cause
a failure of such Company Benefit Plan or trust to be so qualified.

(v) None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor the Company ERISA
Affiliates currently has, and at no time in the past six (6) years has had, an
obligation to contribute to (A) a "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section

Affiliates has incurred any material withdrawal liability under a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, a
"Multiemployer Plan") that has not been satisfied in full, nor does the
Company or any Company Subsidiary have any material contingent liability with
respect to any withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan. None of the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Company ERISA Affiliates
would incur any withdrawal liability (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle
E of Title I of ERISA) if the Company, a Company Subsidiary or any Company
ERISA Affiliate withdrew (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title
I of ERISA) on or prior to the Closing Date from each Multiemployer Plan to
which the Company, a Company Subsidiary or any Company ERISA Affiliate has an
obligation to contribute on the date of this Agreement except as, individually
or in the aggregate, would not be likely to be material to the Company. No
Multiemployer Plan to which the Company, a Company Subsidiary or any Company
ERISA Affiliate contributes or otherwise has any material liability
(contingent or otherwise) has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency

is insolvent, is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section 4241 of

Letter, no Company Benefit Plan provides medical or life insurance benefits
(whether or not insured), with respect to current or former employees,
officers or directors after retirement or other termination of service, other
than coverage required by applicable Law, including pursuant to Section 4980B
of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B or Title I of ERISA. With respect to each
group health plan benefiting any current or former employee of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any Company ERISA Affiliate that is subject to
Section 4980B of the Code, the Company and each Company Subsidiary and Company
ERISA Affiliate has complied with the continuation coverage requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA.

(viii) To the knowledge of the Company, there have been no prohibited
transactions for which an exemption or exception (whether an individual or
class exemption or exception) is unavailable or breaches of any of the duties
imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by
ERISA with respect to the Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably be
anticipated to result in any liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code
being imposed on the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

(ix) To the knowledge of the Company, all contributions, transfers and
payments in respect of any Company Benefit Plan, other than transfers incident
to an incentive stock option plan within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code, have been or are expected to be fully deductible in all material
respects under the Code (x) No Company Benefit Plan is or at any time was
funded through a "welfare benefit fund" as defined in Section 419(e) of the
Code, and no benefits under any Company Benefit Plan are or at any time have
been provided through a voluntary employees\' beneficiary association (within
the meaning of subsection 501(c)(9) of the Code) or a supplemental
unemployment benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(17) of the
Code).

(xi) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be likely to have
or result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, with respect to any insurance
policy providing funding for benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, (i)
there is no liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in the nature
of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement, or other actual or
contingent liability, nor would there be any such liability if such insurance
policy was terminated on the date hereof, and (ii) no insurance company
issuing any such policy is in receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or
similar proceeding or has entered into a solvent or insolvent scheme and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no such proceedings with respect to any such
insurer are imminent.

(xii) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section
409A of the Code, (i) the written terms thereof have at all times since
January 1, 2009 been in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A
of the Code, and (ii) it has, at all times while subject to Section 409A of
the Code, been operated in compliance in all material respects with Section
409A of the Code. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(i)(xii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, no Company Benefit Plan provides for the reimbursement of
Taxes incurred under Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code or other income
taxes incurred under the Code.

(xiii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(xiii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the consummation of the Transactions will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (A) entitle any current or former employee,
officer, director, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (B) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any
such employee, officer, director, consultant or independent contractor or (C)
result in any payment or other benefit that may be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code)
that would be nondeductible under Section 280G of the Code.

(xiv) The term "Foreign Plan" shall mean any Company Benefit Plan that is
maintained for the benefit of employees or other service providers outside of
the United States. Each Foreign Plan complies with all applicable Law
(including, without limitation, applicable Law regarding the form, funding and
operation of the Foreign Plan) in all material respects. The Company\'s
financial statements accurately reflect the Foreign Plan liabilities and
accruals for contributions required to be paid to the Foreign Plans, in
accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. All contributions required to have been made to all
Foreign Plans as of the Closing Date will have been made as of the Closing
Date. There are no actions, suits or claims pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to the Foreign Plans (other than routine
claims for benefits). There have not occurred, nor are there continuing any
transactions or breaches of fiduciary duty under applicable Law with respect
to any Foreign Plan which would have a Company Material Adverse Effect on (1)
any Foreign Plan or (2) the condition of the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any Company ERISA Affiliate.

comparable provision of Law) as a result of a change in method of accounting
for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date
(a "Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (B) pursuant to any installment sale or other
open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, (C) as a
result of any indebtedness discharged in connection with any election under

such third party use of the Company Intellectual Property; and (D) neither the
Company nor the Company Subsidiaries nor the conduct of their respective
businesses has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise conflicted with any
intellectual property rights or other rights of any third parties that
constitutes a claim that is currently outstanding or threatened except with
respect to clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), as would not reasonably be expected
to have or result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(iii) The Transactions will not have a Company Material Adverse Effect on the
right, title and interest of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in and
to, or on the Company\'s and the Company Subsidiaries\' right to use, the
Company Intellectual Property.

(iv) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(n) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
to the knowledge of the Company, the Company or each of the Company
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has taken all necessary action to pay all
maintenance fees and annuities for the Company Intellectual Property set forth
in Schedule 3.1(n) of the Company Disclosure Letter and, until the Effective
Time, shall continue to pay such fees and annuities for the Company
Intellectual Property set forth in Schedule 3.1(n) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, unless otherwise mutually agreed to with Buyer.

(o) Labor Agreements and Employee Issues. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have made available to Parent all collective bargaining
agreements or other agreements with any union or labor organization to which
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries are in material compliance with each such collective
bargaining agreement or other agreement. The Company is unaware of any effort,
activity or proceeding of any labor organization (or representative thereof)
to organize any other of its or their employees. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are not, and have not since October 30, 2010, been subject to any
pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened (i) unfair labor
practice charges and/or complaint, (ii) grievance proceeding or arbitration
proceeding arising under any collective bargaining agreement or other labor
agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, (iii)
claim, suit, action or governmental investigation relating to employees,
including discrimination, wrongful discharge, or violation of any state and/or
federal statute relating to employment practices, (iv) strike, lockout or
dispute, slowdown or work stoppage or (v) claim, suit, action or governmental
investigation, in respect of which any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is or may be entitled to claim
indemnification from the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except, in the
case of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have or result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries is a
party to, or is otherwise bound by, any consent decree with any Governmental
Entity relating to employees or employment practices of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries.

(p) Certain Contracts. As of October 19, 2012, Schedule 3.1(p) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and correct list of each contract,
arrangement, 

commitment or understanding to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a
party to or is bound (i) which is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC); (ii) that contains
covenants that limit the ability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or
which, following the consummation of the Transactions, would restrict the
ability of the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective affiliates) to compete in any business or with any person or in any
geographic area or distribution or sales channel, or to sell, supply or
distribute any service or product, in each case, that would be material to the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii)
which would prohibit or delay the consummation of any of the Transactions;
(iv) for or relating to the material indebtedness of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
made material advances or material loans to any other person other than
advances made to employees with respect to business expenses in the ordinary
course of business, or which grants any Liens on any material property or
material asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (v) relating to joint
ventures or partnerships; (vi) for the sale of any material assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary other than in the ordinary course of
business or for the grant to any person of any preferential rights to purchase
any material assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (vii) for the
acquisition (by merger, purchase of stock or assets or otherwise) by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary of any operating business or material assets
or the capital stock of any other person; (viii) which prohibits or restricts,
in each case, in any material respect, the employment or solicitation for
employment of any persons; (ix) containing a "favored nation" pricing
agreement, special warranties, agreements to take back or exchange goods,
consignment arrangements or similar understandings with a material customer or
material supplier; (x) which is an employment, consulting and non-competition
agreement with any employee, officer or consultant whose base annual
compensation is equal to or greater than $250,000; and (xi) which is a
collective bargaining agreement or agreement with any labor union or
association representing any employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; (each of the foregoing, a "Company Material Contract"). Each
Company Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company and any Company
Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the knowledge of the Company, each
other party thereto and is in full force and effect. There is no default under
any Company Material Contract by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or, to
the knowledge of the Company, by any other party, and no event has occurred
that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a
default thereunder by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the
knowledge of the Company, by any other party, except, in each case, as would
not have or reasonably be expected to have or result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. All contracts, agreements, arrangements or understandings of
any kind between any affiliate of the Company (other than any wholly owned
Company Subsidiary), on the one hand, and the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, on the other hand, are on terms no less favorable to the Company
or to such Company Subsidiary than would be obtained with an unaffiliated
third party on an arm\'s-length basis.

(q) Insurance. Schedule 3.1(q) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
list of all material insurance policies, having open policy periods as of the
date of this Agreement, that were issued to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or which name the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as
an insured (or loss payee), including those which pertain to the Company\'s or
any of the Company Subsidiaries\' assets, employees or operations. All such
insurance policies are in such amounts and cover such losses and risks as are
consistent with industry practice and, in the reasonable judgment of senior
management of the Company, are adequate to protect the properties and
businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and all premiums due
thereunder have been paid. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
in material breach or material default under, or, since January 1, 2010, has
received written notice of permanent cancellation of any such insurance
policies (other than in connection with ordinary course reviews and renewals).

(r) Affiliate Transactions. Except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, during the period commencing on the
date of the Company\'s last proxy statement filed with the SEC through the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that would be required to be
reported by the Company pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated
by the SEC under the Securities Act.

(s) Voting Requirement. The affirmative vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders
of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to adopt this Agreement is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company\'s capital
stock necessary to adopt and approve this Agreement, the Merger and the
Transactions (collectively, the "Company Stockholder Approval").

(t) State Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors of the Company has taken
all necessary action so that no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other anti-takeover Law (each, a "Takeover Statute")
(including the interested stockholder provisions codified in Section 203 of
the DGCL) or any anti-takeover provision in the Company Charter or the
Company\'s by-laws is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the Subsequent
Merger and the Transactions. No other Takeover Statute is applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, the Subsequent Merger or the Transactions. The Board of
Directors of the Company has (i) duly and validly approved this Agreement,
(ii) determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and
(iii) unanimously resolved to recommend to such stockholders that they vote in
favor of the Merger and the Transactions, subject to Section 4.2(c).

(u) Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company has received the opinion of
Barclays Capital Inc., dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that,
as of such date, the Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of
view to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, a signed copy of which
opinion will be delivered to Parent, solely for information purposes, upon
receipt by the Company.

(v) Brokers. Except for Barclays Capital Inc., no broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other person is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s,
financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. The
Company has furnished to Parent true and complete copies of all agreements
under which any such fees, commissions or expenses are payable and all
indemnification and other agreements related to the engagement, in connection
with the Transactions, of the persons to whom such fees, commissions or
expenses are payable.

Section 3.2 Representations and Warranties of Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger
LLC. Subject only to those exceptions and qualifications listed and described
(including an identification by section reference to the representations and
warranties to which such exceptions and qualifications relate) on the
disclosure letter delivered by Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC to the
Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure
Letter"), provided, however, that a matter disclosed in the Parent Disclosure
Letter with respect to one representation or warranty shall also be deemed to
be disclosed with respect to each other representation or warranty to the
extent it is reasonably apparent from the text of such disclosure that such
disclosure relates to or qualifies such other representation or warranty, and
except as set forth in the Recent Parent SEC Reports (excluding any forward
looking statements, risk factors and other similar statements in such Recent
SEC Reports that are cautionary, non-specific or predictive in nature), each
of Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC hereby represents and warrants to the
Company as follows:

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate authority to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Merger LLC is a limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation and has the requisite corporate authority to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of Parent, the Parent
Subsidiaries, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have or result
in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company
prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Parent and Merger Sub, each as
amended to date, and the certificate of formation and the operating agreement
of Merger LLC, each as amended to date. Merger LLC is, and has since the date
of its formation been, treated as an entity that is disregarded as 

separate from Parent for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

(b) Subsidiaries. All outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the "Parent
Subsidiaries" and, together with Parent, the "Parent Entities") (i) have been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) are free and clear
of all Liens other than Permitted Liens and (iii) are free of any other
restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests). All outstanding
shares of capital stock (or equivalent equity interests of entities other than
corporations) of each of the Parent Subsidiaries are beneficially owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent. Parent does not, directly or indirectly,
own more than 20% but less than 100% of the capital stock or other equity
interest in any person other than the Parent Subsidiaries.

(c) Capital Structure.

(i) Capitalization of Parent. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists
of (i) 400,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) 40,000,000 shares of

future awards under Parent\'s equity incentive plans (the "Parent Stock Plans"
and all options to purchase Parent Common Stock granted pursuant to the Parent
Stock Plans, the "Parent Stock Options"); and (iv) no shares of Parent\'s
preferred stock were issued or outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital
stock of Parent are, and all shares that may be issued will be, when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject

in this Section 3.2(c), there are not issued, reserved for issuance or

from Parent or any Parent Subsidiary any capital stock, voting securities or
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock
or voting securities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 3.2(c), there are no outstanding obligations of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to (i) issue, deliver or sell, or caused to be
issued, delivered or sold, any capital stock, voting securities or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or voting
securities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or (ii) repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any such securities. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary is a party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of
any such securities. Except as otherwise provided in this

Section 3.2(c), there are no agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character (contingent or otherwise) pursuant to which any person is or may be
entitled to receive from Parent or a Parent Subsidiary any payment based on
the revenues, earnings or financial performance of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary or assets or calculated in accordance therewith.

(ii) Capitalization of Merger Sub. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists solely of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all
of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, directly
owned by Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date
hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets,
liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its
formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger, the Subsequent Merger
and the Transactions.

(iii) Capitalization of Merger LLC. All of the issued and outstanding
membership interests of Merger LLC are, and at the Effective Time will be,
directly owned by Parent. Merger LLC has not conducted any business prior to
the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no,
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger, the Subsequent
Merger and the Transactions.

(iv) Stock Ownership. None of Parent, Merger Sub, or Merger LLC owns, or,
prior to the Effective Time, will own, beneficially or of record, any shares
of capital stock of the Company.

(d) Authority; Noncontravention. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC
has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power, as the case
may be, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, Merger
Sub, and Merger LLC and the consummation by Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC
of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or
limited liability company action, as the case may be, on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, and Merger LLC, respectively, including, but not limited to, the
adoption by the Board of Directors of Parent of resolutions approving this
Agreement, the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent, Merger Sub,
and Merger LLC and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
the Company, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent,
Merger Sub, and Merger LLC enforceable against Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger
LLC in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar Laws generally affecting the rights of creditors and subject to
general equity principles. The execution and delivery of this Agreement does
not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with the articles of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of any of
the Parent Entities, (ii) assuming that all the consents, approvals and
filings referred to in the next sentence are duly obtained and/or made, (A)
result in any breach, violation or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
creation or acceleration of any material obligation or loss of a material
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the material
properties or assets of Parent, Merger Sub, or Merger LLC under any material
loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
material agreement, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license or
other authorization applicable to any of the Parent Entities or their
respective properties or assets, or (B) conflict with or violate any judgment,
order, decree or Law applicable to Parent, Merger Sub, or Merger LLC or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (ii) (A)
and (B), any such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults, rights, losses or
Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have or result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No consent, approval,
order or authorization of, action by or in respect of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or third party is required
by Parent, Merger Sub, or Merger LLC in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC or the
consummation by Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC of the Transactions, except
for: (i) the filing with the SEC of (A) the Form S-4 and (B) such reports
under Section 13(a), 13(d), 15(d) or 16(a) or such other applicable sections
of the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and

Merger to be listed on the NYSE; and (vi) such consents, approvals, orders or
authorizations the failure of which to be made or obtained, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(e) SEC Reports and Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal
Controls.

(i) Parent has timely filed all required reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated
therein) under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with the SEC since
December 31, 2010 (as such reports, schedules, forms, statements and documents
have been amended since the time of their filing, collectively, the "Parent
SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, or if amended prior to the date
of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC
Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents when filed, or as so amended,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in 

comment letters received from the SEC staff.

(ii) The financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents
comply as to form, as of their respective date of filing with the SEC, in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and on
that basis fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders\' equity for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal recurring year-end audit adjustments). No Parent Subsidiary is required
to make any filings with the SEC. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Documents filed since December 31, 2010 and prior to the date of this
Agreement (the "Recent Parent SEC Reports"), since December 31, 2010, Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities (direct,
contingent or otherwise) that are of a nature that would be required to be
disclosed on a balance sheet of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries or the
footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than (A) liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business, and (B) liabilities that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have or result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(iii) As and to the extent described in the Parent SEC Documents, Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP. Parent (A) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Parent by others
within those entities, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parent\'s auditors and the audit
committee of Parent\'s Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies or
material weakness in the design or operation of internal controls which would
adversely affect in any material respect Parent\'s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parent\'s internal controls.

(f) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent, Merger Sub, or Merger LLC specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Proxy Statement will,
at the date it is first mailed to the Company\'s stockholders or at the time
of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no
representation or warranty is made by Parent, Merger Sub, or Merger LLC with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4.

(g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except for liabilities incurred in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, since December 31, 2011,
(i) each of the Parent Entities has conducted its respective operations in all
material respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, (ii)
there has not been any event, circumstance, change, occurrence or state of
facts that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (iii) except as set
forth on Schedule 3.2(g), none of the Parent Entities has taken any action
that if taken after the date of this Agreement would constitute a violation of
the following clauses: Section 4.1(b)(i) and Section 4.1(b)(iii) (but solely
with respect to the foregoing enumerated clauses).

(h) Compliance with Applicable Laws; Litigation.

(i) The operations of the Parent Entities have not been since January 1, 2010
and are not being conducted in violation of any Law (including the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001) or any Permit necessary for
the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted, except
where such violations, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have or result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Since January 1, 2010, none of the Parent Entities has received any
written notice regarding any actual or possible violation in any material
respect, or failure to comply in any material respect with, any Law or Permit.

(ii) The Parent Entities hold all Permits necessary for the conduct of their
respective businesses as currently conducted, except where the failure to hold
such Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have or result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
None of the Parent Entities has received written notice that any such material
Permit will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary
course of business. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions do not and will not violate any such
Permit, or result in any termination, modification or nonrenewals thereof,
except for such violations, terminations, modifications or nonrenewals thereof
as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
or result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(iii) There is no suit, action or proceeding by or before any Governmental
Entity pending (or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened) to which Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary is a party or against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or
any of their properties or assets that would reasonably be expected to have or
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there is no
suit, action or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
challenging or seeking to prohibit the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement or any of the Transactions.

(i) Employee Benefit Plans.

(i) Each (A) "employee benefit plan," as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA and
(B) other bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive
compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, equity
compensation, retirement, vacation, employment, disability, death benefit,
hospitalization, medical insurance, life insurance, welfare, severance, change
of control or other employee benefit plan, agreement, arrangement or
understanding (whether written or oral, qualified or nonqualified, funded or
unfunded, foreign or domestic), in each case which is sponsored, maintained or
contributed to, or required to be contributed to, by Parent or any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated, which, together with Parent, would be
deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of
ERISA or Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code (a "Parent ERISA Affiliate") in
respect of any current or former employees, officers, directors, consultants
or independent contractors of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (collectively,
the "Parent Benefit Plans") has been maintained, operated and administered in
compliance with its terms, all applicable Laws, and the terms of all
applicable collective bargaining agreements.

(ii) Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter
from the IRS as to its qualified status and each trust created thereunder has
received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS as to its
qualified status under Section 501(a) of the Code, and to the knowledge of
Parent, there exist no facts or circumstances that have caused or could cause
a failure of such Parent Benefit Plan or trust to be so qualified.

(iii) None of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor the Parent ERISA Affiliates
currently has, and at no time in the past six (6) years has had, an obligation
to contribute to (A) a "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA, (B) a pension plan subject to the funding standards of Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or (C) a "multiple employer plan" within the
meaning of Section 210(a) of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code. The funding
status of each Parent Benefit Plan or other Benefit Plan maintained by any
Parent ERISA Affiliate subject to Title IV of ERISA has been fully and
accurately disclosed in the Parent\'s audited financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

(iv) None of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor the Parent ERISA Affiliates
has incurred any material withdrawal liability under a Multiemployer Plan that
has not been satisfied in full, nor does Parent or any Parent Subsidiary have
any material contingent liability with respect to any withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan. None of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective Parent ERISA Affiliates would incur any withdrawal liability
(within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) if Parent, a
Parent Subsidiary or any Parent ERISA Affiliate withdrew (within the meaning
of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) on or prior to the Closing Date
from each Multiemployer Plan to which Parent, a Parent Subsidiary or any
Parent ERISA Affiliate has an obligation to contribute on the date of this
Agreement, except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not be likely to
be material to Parent. No Multiemployer Plan to which Parent, a Parent
Subsidiary or any Parent ERISA Affiliate contributes or otherwise has any
material liability (contingent or otherwise) has incurred an accumulated
funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 431(a) of the Code or Section

satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification will affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or

Section 4.2 No Solicitation by the Company.

(a) Company Takeover Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company
shall and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their officers,
directors, employees, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors, investment bankers, representatives and agents retained by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company
Representatives") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated immediately
all existing activities, discussions and negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal. From the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, and shall direct the Company Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information), or knowingly
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes a
Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement or enter
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any of the other 

Transactions, or (iii) initiate or participate in any way in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish or disclose to any person (other than a
party hereto) any non-public information with respect to, or take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes any Company Takeover Proposal (other than a Company Representative
contacting the person making a Company Takeover Proposal or its
representatives for the sole purpose of clarifying such Company Takeover
Proposal); provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in
response to an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and Barclays Capital Inc. or another
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Company Takeover
Proposal was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 4.2 (other than from an immaterial breach of this
Section 4.2, the effect of which is not material), the Company may, if and
only to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do
so would be reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Delaware Law, and subject to
compliance with Section 4.2(c), if applicable, (i) furnish information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such
Company Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive (in the aggregate) of such
person than the Confidentiality Agreement (provided, however, that no such
confidentiality agreement need include "standstill" provisions); provided,
however, that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or
is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person, and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its
representatives) regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting
the foregoing, the parties agree that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 4.2(a) (other than from an immaterial violation of this
Section 4.2, the effect of which is not material) by any Company
Representative, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 4.2 by the Company.

(b) Definitions. As used herein:

(i) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal
(except that the references in the definition thereof to "30%" shall be
replaced by "60%") that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
its good faith judgment (after consulting with outside counsel and Barclays
Capital Inc. or another financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation), taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal, the likelihood and anticipated timing of required
governmental approvals and consummation, and the ability of the person making
the proposal to finance and pay for the contemplated consideration, would be
more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the Transactions
(including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in
response to such Company Takeover Proposal, including with respect to the
Merger Consideration); and

(ii) "Company Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer from any person
(other than Parent or its affiliates) relating to any (A) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 30% or more of the net
revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase
of 30% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 30% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
or (D) any merger, consolidation, business combination, asset purchase,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company, or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated or permitted by
this Agreement, that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning 30% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries.

(c) Actions by the Company. Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor
any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such
Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger
or the other Transactions or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, or fail to reject, any Company
Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to
as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
4.2(a)) (an "Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith that failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Delaware Law, the Company may (A) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and cause the Company to enter into
an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (which was made
after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 4.2 (other than from an immaterial breach of this Section 4.2, the
effect of which is not material)) or (B) make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, if, in either case of (A) or (B): (x) the Company provides written
notice (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") advising Parent that the Board
of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor, including, if applicable, the material terms and conditions
of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board
of Directors (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the amount
of consideration or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation); (y) during the Parent Review
Period the Company negotiates with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger
and not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and (z) if
applicable, at the end of such Parent Review Period, the Board of Directors of
the Company continues to believe that the Company Takeover Proposal, if any,
constitutes a Superior Proposal (after taking into account such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement). No Company Adverse Recommendation
Change shall change a prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company
that caused any state takeover Law (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or
other state Law to be inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notice of Company Takeover Proposal. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within 36 hours after
receipt) notify Parent in the event that the Company receives, directly or
indirectly, (i) any Company Takeover Proposal; (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to any of the Company Entities by any person that informs
the Company or any Company Representative that such person is considering
making, or has made, a Company Takeover Proposal, or (iii) any request for
discussions or negotiations relating to a possible Company Takeover Proposal.
Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate
the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the other party
or parties involved and promptly furnish to Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC
a copy of any such written inquiry, request or proposal and copies of any
information provided to or by any third party relating thereto. The Company
undertakes that it shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed, in all
material respects, of the status and details (including amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and
promptly keep Parent reasonably informed, in all material respects, as to the
details of any information requested of or provided by the Company and as to
the details of discussions or negotiations with respect to any such request,
Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry, including by providing a copy of all
documentation or material correspondence relating to the Company Takeover
Proposal.

(e) Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Other Applicable Law. Nothing contained in
this Section 4.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company
from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors (after consultation with outside counsel),
failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to violate its
obligations under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors of the Company may not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, unless permitted to do so by Section 4.2(c), provided, further, that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in and of itself shall not be considered a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change. 

(f) Return or Destruction of Confidential Information. The Company undertakes
that, immediately following the execution of this Agreement, it shall request
each person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with such person\'s consideration of acquiring the Company to

person by or on the Company\'s behalf.

ARTICLE V

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 5.1 Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Company
Stockholder Meeting.

(a) Form S-4/Proxy Statement. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement and Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will
be included as a prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cause the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC, (ii) to promptly notify the other of, cooperate with each other with
respect to, and respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff,
(iii) to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and (iv) to keep the Form S-4
effective through the Closing in order to permit the consummation of the
Transactions. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders, as promptly
as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by
Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
will be made by the Company or Parent, in each case, without providing the
other party and its respective counsel the reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon and giving due consideration to such comments.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Company may amend or
supplement the Proxy Statement to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger. Parent will advise the Company,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective, the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information must be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

(b) Stockholders Meetings. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
special meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") in
accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter and by-laws for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section
4.2(c), the Company shall (A) through the Board of Directors of the Company,
recommend to its stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the
Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other Transactions and include in the
Proxy Statement such recommendation and (B) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit and obtain such approval and adoption. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, subject to Section 4.2(c), the Company
acknowledges that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 5.1(b) shall not be affected by any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company or its stockholders of any Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with the Company\'s stockholder
list as and when requested by Parent, including at any time and from time to
time following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after
consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting: (1) to the extent the Company believes in good faith it is necessary
to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that is
required by applicable Law is timely provided to the Company\'s stockholders;
(2) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally
scheduled there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business to be conducted at the Company Stockholders Meeting; or (3) to the
extent it believes in good faith that additional time is reasonably required
to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement; provided,
however, that any such adjournment or postponement shall not exceed ten (10)
calendar days.

Section 5.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of (a) the Effective Time or (b) the date on which
this Agreement is terminated, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
subject to the agreement, dated August 7, 2012, between the Company and Parent
(as amended, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the Company shall, and shall
cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to the Parent\'s
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to all of its
properties, books, Tax work papers, Tax Returns, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request upon reasonable
prior notice. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. With respect to all
information furnished by the Company to Parent or its Representatives under
this Agreement, Parent shall comply with, and shall cause its respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.3 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation.

(a) Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including Section 5.3(c), each of the
parties undertakes to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other Transactions and
to obtain satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the Merger, including
without limitation (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, clearances, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) preventing
the entry, enactment or promulgation of any injunction or order or Law that
could materially and adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to
consummate the Transactions under this Agreement, (iv) seeking the lifting or
rescission of any injunction or order or Law that could materially and
adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
Transactions under this Agreement, (v) cooperating to defend against any
proceeding or investigation relating to this Agreement or the Transactions and
to cooperate to defend against it and respond thereto, (vi) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement, (vii) using commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for the
Company\'s independent accountants to provide such comfort letters, consents
and other services that are reasonably required in connection with Parent\'s
financings of the Cash Consideration and (viii) assisting in the marketing and
sale or any other syndication of any such financings by making appropriate
officers of the Company available for due diligence meetings and for
participation in the road show and meetings with prospective participants in
such financings upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, provided, that
in the case of clauses (vii) and (viii), Parent shall promptly reimburse the
Company for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by, and otherwise indemnify
and hold harmless, the Company, its Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors, accountants and representatives from and 

against all liabilities, relating to such actions other than those arising
from such person\'s willful misconduct or gross negligence. For purposes of
this Agreement, commercially reasonable efforts shall not require the parties
to (i) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct the business of
the Company, Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates in a manner
which would resolve such objections or suits, (ii) agree to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct the business of the Company,
Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates in a manner which would
resolve such objections or suits, (iii) permit the sale, holding separate or
other disposition of, any of the assets of the Company, Parent and/or any of
their respective affiliates or the execution of any agreement or order to do
so, and (iv) conduct the business of the Company, Parent and/or any of their
respective affiliates in a manner which would resolve such objections or
suits. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Company undertakes to make an appropriate filing under HSR with
respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and in any event within
15 Business Days following the date hereof and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable.

(b) No Takeover Statutes Apply. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC shall (i) take all
action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
Transactions and (ii) if any Takeover Statute or similar Law becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions,
take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions
may be lawfully consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on the Merger and the other Transactions.

(c) Information Cooperation. In connection with the efforts referenced in
Section 5.3(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
Transactions under the HSR Act, and to obtain all such approvals and
authorizations under any other applicable Antitrust Law, each of Parent and
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other party informed in
all material respects of any material communication (and if in writing,
provide a copy of such communication) received by such party from, or given by
such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) permit the other
party to review any material communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any such Governmental
Entity or in connection with any proceeding by a private party, (iv) consult
and cooperate with the other party and consider in good faith the views of the
other party in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals made or submitted by or on
behalf of the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates to any
such Governmental Entity or private party and (v) not participate in any
substantive meeting or have any substantive communication with any
Governmental Entity unless it has given the other parties a reasonable
opportunity to consult with it in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate
therein. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and any attorney-client,
work product or other privilege, each of the parties hereto will coordinate
and cooperate fully with the other parties hereto in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as such other parties may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of
any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act. Any competitively sensitive
information that is disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.3(c) will be limited
to each of Parent\'s and the Company\'s respective counsel pursuant to a
separate customary confidentiality agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all
other Laws that are designed, intended or operate to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(d) If applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall be responsible for preparing and timely submitting any and all
filings and other submissions and taking any and all other steps and actions
as required by any Governmental Entity of any jurisdiction identified on
Section 3.1(l)(vi) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to comment on all such
filings and submissions prior to submittal to any Governmental Entity.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.3, if any objections are asserted with respect to
the Transactions under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted or
threatened to be instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party
challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any Law or which would
otherwise prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC, and the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so
as to permit the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, and
they shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to
acquire any assets, business, securities, person or subdivision thereof, if
the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of
such acquisition, could reasonably be expected to materially delay or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining the applicable action,
nonaction, waiver, clearance, consent or approval under the Antitrust Laws or
any other competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Laws.

(f) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC acknowledge and agree that
their obligations to consummate the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the
other Transactions are not conditioned or contingent upon receipt of any
financing.

Section 5.4 Stock Options; Restricted Stock and Performance Shares.

(a) Assumption of Company Stock Plans and Award Agreements. At the Effective
Time, the Company Stock Plan and all awards granted thereunder that are
assumed by Parent pursuant to the following provisions of this Section 5.4
(together with all agreements that govern the treatment of such assumed awards
(each, an "Award Agreement")), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of any holder of any such award, be assumed by
Parent. Parent shall take all necessary and appropriate corporate actions to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock upon
the exercise or other settlement of the Adjusted Options, Adjusted SARs and
Adjusted RSUs, as applicable, including registering such shares on an
appropriate form of registration statement under the Securities Act, and
maintaining the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as
such Adjusted Options, Adjusted SARs and Adjusted RSUs, as applicable, remain
outstanding.

(b) Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and
unexercised Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall, without any further action on the part of any
holder of a Company Stock Option, be assumed by Parent. Each such outstanding
Company Stock Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable in
connection with the Merger in accordance with the existing terms thereof.
Except for the acceleration of the Company Stock Options in accordance with
the terms of the Company Stock Plan and applicable Award Agreements prior to
or at the Effective Time, each such Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent
hereunder (an "Adjusted Option") shall continue to have, and be subject to,
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
corresponding Company Stock Option under the Company Stock Plan and applicable
Award Agreements immediately before the Effective Time, except that, (x) each
Adjusted Option will be exercisable for that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock to which the corresponding Company
Stock Option related immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, and (y) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Adjusted Option
will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per share exercise
price of the Company Stock Option by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (rounded
up 

to the nearest whole cent). The date of grant of each Adjusted Option will be
the date on which the corresponding Company Stock Option was granted.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjustment described in this Section 5.4(b)
shall be made in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the Code and, with
respect to each Company Stock Option that is an incentive stock option (within
the meaning of Section 422(b) of the Code), no adjustment will be made that
would be a modification (within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code) to
such Company Stock Option.

(c) Company Stock Appreciation Rights. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
and unexercised Company SAR, whether vested or unvested immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall, without any further action on the part of any
holder of a Company SAR, be assumed by Parent. Each such outstanding Company
SAR shall become immediately vested and exercisable in connection with the
Merger in accordance with the existing terms thereof. Except for the
acceleration of the Company SARs in accordance with the terms of the Company
Stock Plan and applicable Award Agreements prior to or at the Effective Time,
each such Company SAR so assumed by Parent hereunder (each, an "Adjusted SAR")
shall continue to have, and be subject to, substantially the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the corresponding Company SAR under the
Company Stock Plan and applicable Award Agreements immediately before the
Effective Time, except that, (x) each Adjusted SAR will relate to a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock to which the
corresponding Company SAR related immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by the sum of the Equity Award Exchange Ratio and (y) the per share
base price relating to each such Adjusted SAR will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the per share base price of the Company SAR by the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The date
of grant of each Adjusted SAR will be the date on which the corresponding
Company SAR was granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjustment
described in this Section 5.4(c) shall be made in a manner consistent with
Section 409A of the Code.

(d) Company Restricted Shares. At or prior to the Effective Time, each Company
Restricted Share shall become vested and no longer subject to restrictions, in
accordance with the Company Stock Plans and applicable Award Agreements, and
as a result shall be treated in the Merger as set forth in Section 2.1.

(e) Company Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU
shall, without any further action on the part of any holder of a Company RSU,
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as if such
Company RSU was one (1) share of Company Common Stock and otherwise as set
forth in Section 2.1; provided, however, that to the extent that such
treatment would cause additional Taxes to be paid by the holder thereof under
Section 409A of the Code, Parent shall, without any further action on the part
of any holder of a Company RSU, assume the applicable Company RSU and each
such Company RSU so assumed by Parent hereunder (each, an "Adjusted RSU")
shall continue to have, and be subject to, substantially the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the corresponding Company RSU under the
Company Stock Plan and applicable Award Agreements immediately before the
Effective Time, except that such Adjusted RSU will be converted into the right
to receive a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
to which the Company RSU related immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

(f) Required Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all
actions necessary to provide for and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 5.4, including, (i) to the extent determined
necessary or advisable by the Company (in consultation with Parent), using
commercially reasonable efforts to acquire the written consent of each holder
of a Company Stock Option, Company SAR and Company RSU, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, to the treatment of such Company Stock Option, Company
SAR and Company RSU as provided in this Section 5.4, and (ii) satisfying all
applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.
The Company shall provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity
to comment upon, all resolutions and other written actions as may be required
to give effect to the provisions of this Section 5.4.

(g) Withholding; Interest. All amounts payable at the Effective Time pursuant
to this Section 5.4 shall be paid net of any required withholding of federal,
state, local or foreign Taxes, unless withholding is effected otherwise with
the consent of the recipient, and shall be paid without interest.

Section 5.5 Indemnification; DandO Insurance.

(a) Rights Assumed by Surviving Corporation and Surviving Company. Parent,
Merger Sub, and Merger LLC agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, or exculpation arising from, relating to, or
otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors,
officers, employees, fiduciaries, or agents of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation,
by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement between
the Company or Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or
former director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of the Company or
Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in effect on the date hereof shall
survive the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, will be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Company without further action, as of the
Effective Time, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms and such rights will not be amended, or otherwise modified, for a
period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of individuals who on or prior to the Effective
Time were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries, or agents of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, unless such modification is required by
Law. In the event that any claim for indemnification or advancement of
expenses is asserted or made prior to the Effective Time or within such six-
year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall
continue until the final disposition of such claim.

(b) Indemnification under this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time,
each of Parent, Surviving Corporation and, following the Subsequent Merger,
the Surviving Company shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless and advance
expenses to each present and former director and officer of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against
all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, inquiries, liabilities and settlement amounts
paid in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their
capacity as such (including any claim arising out of this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the Transactions), whether occurring before or after the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the
Indemnified Parties shall have the right to retain counsel (including local
counsel) satisfactory to them, the reasonable fees and expenses of which shall
be paid by Parent, Surviving Corporation and Surviving Company, following
commencement of such action or proceeding, promptly after statements or
invoices therefor are received and (ii) Parent, Surviving Corporation and
Surviving Company shall cooperate in and use commercially reasonable efforts
so as to assist in such director\'s or officer\'s vigorous defense of any such
matter; provided, however, that Parent, Surviving Corporation and Surviving
Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their
respective written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned); and provided, further, that Surviving Corporation and
Surviving Company shall not be obligated pursuant to this subsection (b) to
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one counsel (plus
appropriate local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in any single action
unless there is, as determined by counsel to the Indemnified Parties, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict or a reasonable
likelihood of a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any
two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case such additional counsel
(including local counsel) as may be required to avoid any such conflict or
likely conflict may be retained by the Indemnified Parties at the expense of
the Surviving Corporation and Surviving Company. The Surviving Corporation and
Surviving Company shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.5.

(c) Successors and Assigns. In the event that Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(or any of their respective successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or 

(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
or the Surviving Company, or the properties and assets thereof, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5.

(d) Continuing Coverage. From the Effective Time and for a period of six (6)
years thereafter, Parent, Surviving Corporation and, following the Subsequent
Merger, the Surviving Company shall cause to be maintained in effect
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance (including Side A coverage)
covering claims arising from factors or events that accrued at or prior to the
Effective Time to the extent that such claims are of the type covered by the
Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy (a
copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent) (the "Current DandO
Policy"), including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions to the extent that such
acts or omissions are covered by the Current DandO Policy) and covering each
Indemnified Party who is covered as of the Effective Time by the Current DandO
Policy, in any case on terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less
favorable than those of the Current DandO Policy; provided, however, that in no
event will Parent, Surviving Corporation or Surviving Company be required to
expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for the Current DandO Policy; and provided,
further, that, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Parent will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and provided, further,
however, that at Parent\'s option in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage,
the Surviving Corporation, Surviving Company or Parent may purchase six-year
"tail" insurance coverage in favor of the Indemnified Parties on terms with
respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than the
Current DandO Policy.

(e) Intended Beneficiaries. The obligations under this Section 5.5 shall not
be terminated, amended, or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, and his or her representatives
and, in the case of Section 5.5(a), current and former directors, officers,
employees, fiduciaries, or agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
without the prior written consent of such affected person. The provisions of
this Section 5.5 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, and his or her
representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all agreements of or entered into by Company
or any Company Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).
The provisions of this Section 5.5 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and the Subsequent Merger.

Section 5.6 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before holding any press conferences, analysts calls or other
meetings or discussions and before issuing any press release or other public
announcements with respect to the Transactions, including the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger. The parties will provide each other the opportunity to
review and comment upon any press release or other public announcement or
statement with respect to the Transactions, including the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or other public
announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange. The parties agree
that the initial press release or releases to be issued with respect to the
Transactions shall be mutually agreed upon prior to the issuance thereof.

Section 5.7 NYSE Listing. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Parent Common Stock issuable either to the Company\'s
stockholders as contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant to Section 5.4, to
be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event
prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.8 Stockholder Litigation. The parties to this Agreement shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and consult with one another in
connection with any stockholder litigation against any of them or any of their
respective directors or officers with respect to the Transactions. In
furtherance of and without in any way limiting the foregoing, each of the
parties shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to prevail in
such litigation so as to permit the consummation of the Transactions in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company undertakes that it will not
compromise or settle any litigation commenced against it or its directors or
officers relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (including the Merger)
without Parent\'s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

Section 5.9 Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality Agreements. During the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company
shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, is a party, other than (a) the
Confidentiality Agreement, pursuant to its terms or by written agreement of
the parties thereto, (b) confidentiality agreements under which the Company
does not provide any confidential information to third parties, or (c)
standstill agreements that do not relate to the equity securities of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. During such period, the Company
shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
provisions of any such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to
prevent any breaches of such agreements and by enforcing specifically the
terms and provisions thereof in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 5.10 Section 16(b). Parent and the Company shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) in
connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

Section 5.11 Employee Benefit Matters.

(a) Company Obligations. To the extent permitted by the Company Benefit Plans,
prior to the Closing, the Company shall adopt such amendments to the Company
Benefit Plans as reasonably requested by Parent prior to the Prepayment Notice
Date, if applicable, and only such amendments as may be necessary to ensure
that Company Benefit Plans cover only employees and former employees (and
their dependents and beneficiaries) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries following the consummation of the Transactions; provided that
nothing herein shall prohibit Parent or the Company from amending the Company
Benefit Plans on or after the Closing. With respect to any Company Common
Stock held by any Company Benefit Plan as of the date of this Agreement or
thereafter, the Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate
(including such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent prior to the
Prepayment Notice Date, if applicable) to ensure that all participant voting
procedures contained in the Company Benefit Plans relating to such shares, and
all applicable provisions of ERISA, are complied with in full.

(b) Credit for Service of Company Employees. If employees of the Company at
the Effective Time other than individuals covered by a collective bargaining
agreement ("Company Employees") are included in any benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (a "Parent Plan") following the Effective
Time, such Company Employees shall receive credit for service with the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to the Effective
Time to the same extent such service was counted under similar Company Benefit
Plans for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit
accrual under such Parent Plan, provided that (i) such recognition of service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefits payable to the Company Employee
with respect to the same period of service, (ii) service of Company Employees
subject to collective bargaining agreements or obligations shall be determined
under such collective bargaining agreements or obligations, (iii) in no event
will such recognition of service for purposes of benefit levels or benefit
accrual under a defined benefit pension plan of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary apply for any purpose, and (iv) in no event will such recognition
of service be taken into account for purposes of determining a Company
Employee\'s 

eligibility to participate in a retiree medical benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. If Company Employees or their dependents are
included in any medical, dental or health plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (a "Successor Plan") other than the plan or plans in which they
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Prior Plan"), any
such Successor Plan shall not include any restrictions or limitations with
respect to pre-existing condition exclusions or any actively-at-work
requirements (except to the extent such exclusions were applicable under any
similar Prior Plan at the Effective Time) and any eligible expenses incurred
by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of such Prior Plan ending on the date such Company
Employee\'s participation in such Successor Plan begins shall be taken into
account under such Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Successor Plan; provided
however, that the rights under a Successor Plan of any Company Employee
subject to collective bargaining agreements or obligations shall be determined
pursuant to such collective bargaining agreements or obligations.

(c) Company Employee Compensation and Benefits. From the Effective Time until
the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, provide to each Company Employee compensation and benefit
arrangements (other than equity-based awards) that are substantially similar,
in the aggregate, to the compensation and benefit arrangements (other than
equity-based awards) to which such Company Employee was entitled immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(d) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall (i)
confer any rights upon any person, including any Company Employee or former
employees of the Company, other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, (ii) constitute or create an employment
agreement, or (iii) constitute or be treated as the amendment, modification or
adoption of any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Company of any of their
Affiliates.

Section 5.12 Company Credit Facility. The Company shall, prior to the Closing
Date, deliver to Parent a payoff letter in customary form, providing that upon
receipt from the Surviving Corporation of the repayment amount stated therein
on the Closing Date, all of the Company\'s outstanding obligations (other than
contingent obligations for indemnification that are not then due and payable)
under that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated June 9, 2010,
as amended, by and among the Company, PNC Capital Markets LLC, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo Bank and PNC Bank National Association will be
satisfied and all Liens thereunder will be released or terminated, as
applicable.

Section 5.13 Tax Treatment.

(a) Parent shall adopt and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to adopt an
agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with respect to the Subsequent
Merger pursuant to which the Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and
into Merger LLC with Merger LLC surviving and becoming the Surviving Company.
Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC intend that the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, be treated, and each of them shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken
together, to be treated, for federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization"
under Section 368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent and the Company are
to be parties under Section 368(b) of the Code). Each party hereto agrees to
cooperate with the other parties and to provide to the other parties such
information and documentation as may be necessary, proper or advisable, to
cause the Merger and the Subsequent Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt,
negotiation, settlement or payment of appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL shall be treated as an action taken pursuant to this Agreement.
Each of the parties hereto and their respective Affiliates shall file all Tax
Returns consistent with, and take no position inconsistent with, such
treatment unless required to do so by applicable Law. Each of Parent and the
Company shall deliver to Jones Day and KandL Gates LLP customary representation
letters in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, and at
such time or times that may be reasonably requested by such counsel (the
representation letters referred to in this sentence are collectively referred
to as the "Tax Certificates"). The parties to this Agreement agree to make
such reasonable representations as requested by counsel for the purpose of
rendering the opinions described in Section 6.2(c) and Section 6.3(c),
including representations in the Tax Certificates. Parent\'s and the
Company\'s respective tax counsel shall be entitled to rely upon such
representations in rendering their opinions

(b) Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC hereby adopt this
Agreement as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company expects to be able to make
representations at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by
counsel, including the effective date of the Form S-4 and the Closing Date,
for purposes of rendering the opinions described in Section 6.2(c) and Section
6.3(c). The Company shall immediately notify Parent, if, at any time before
the Effective Time, the Company becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, from being treated as a "reorganization"
under Section 368(a) of the Code.

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent expects to be able to make
representations at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by
counsel, including the effective date of the Form S-4 and the Closing Date,
for purposes of rendering the opinions described in Section 6.2(c) and Section
6.3(c). Parent shall immediately notify the Company, if, at any time before
the Effective Time, Parent becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, from being treated as a "reorganization"
under Section 368(a) of the Code.

Section 5.14 Obligations of Merger Sub and Merger LLC. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub and Merger LLC and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and Surviving Company to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 5.15 Certain Pre-Closing Matters. If requested by Parent (a
"Prepayment Request"), no later than one (1) Business Day following the
Prepayment Notice Date, the Company will deliver a prepayment notice to the
holders of the Notes providing for the 30-day notice of prepayment of the
Notes pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Notes Agreement in order to
prepay the Notes on the 31st day following such notice (the "Prepayment
Notice"). The prepayment notice shall be prepared by the Company and its
counsel, with Parent and Merger Sub and its counsel having the opportunity to
review and provide reasonable comments thereon, with the Company giving due
consideration to such comments. The specified date for prepayment of the Notes
in the Prepayment Notice shall be the 31st day from the date of such
Prepayment Notice.

except that the Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 7.2, Section 7.3, and
Article VIII shall survive such termination and shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms; provided, however, that,

Section 7.3 Fees and Expenses.

(a) Division of Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger,
this Agreement and the Transactions, including attorney\'s fees, will be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is

half of the costs and expenses, other than attorney\'s fees, incurred (i) in
connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement (including SEC filing fees) and (ii) in connection with the
solicitation of proxies from the Company\'s stockholders (including the fees

7.1(b)(ii), or Section 7.1(c)(i), and (A) prior to such termination, a Company

directly to its stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly

or (B) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Company Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall (1) in the
case of termination pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 7.3(b), promptly,
but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such
termination, (2) in the case of termination pursuant to clause (ii) of this
Section 7.3(b), on the date of termination of this Agreement, or (3) in the
case of termination pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 7.3(b), within
two (2) Business Days after the earlier to occur of the execution of such
definitive agreement and such consummation, pay by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account designated in writing to the Company by Parent, to Parent
a non-refundable fee equal to $8,800,000 (the "Company Termination Fee"), less
any Out-of-Pocket Expenses paid to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(c). For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay, or
cause to be paid, the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. If
the Company becomes obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee, Parent
agrees that its right to receive the Company Termination Fee shall be its sole
and exclusive remedy against the Company and, upon payment of the Company
Termination Fee, the Company shall not have any liability or obligation to
Parent relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

(c) Other Expenses and Fees. In the event of a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) (other than in any circumstance in which a
Company Termination Fee is paid pursuant to Section 7.3(b)) or Section
7.1(b)(ii), the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Out-of-
Pocket Expenses of Parent by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated in writing to the Company by Parent promptly, but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination. In the event of
a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i), the Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Out-of-Pocket Expenses of
the Company by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in
writing to the Parent by the Company promptly, but in no event later than two
(2) Business Days after the date of such termination. "Out-of-Pocket Expenses"
means, with respect to any party hereto, all out-of-pocket expenses and fees
(including all fees and expenses payable to all legal, accounting, financial,
public relations and other professional advisors arising out of in connection
with or related to the Merger or other Transactions) of such party up to a
maximum of $1,750,000 in the aggregate.

(d) Failure to Pay Fees and Expenses. Each party acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails to pay promptly the amounts
due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, the
other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party,
such party shall pay to the other party its reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of such overdue amount (for the
period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required
to be paid through the date such overdue amount is actually paid to the other
party in full) at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing
at such time, as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus two percent per
annum.

agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Subject to
Section 8.1, the failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

Section 8.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any

or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to
