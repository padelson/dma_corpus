The Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Company&rsquo;s auditors
and the audit committee of the Company Board (i)&nbsp;all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company&rsquo;s internal controls, and the Company has made available to Parent copies
of any material written materials relating to the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to the Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge
of the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Company&rsquo;s principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information required to be included in the Company&rsquo;s periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer (as defined in Rule&nbsp;3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
of the Company.</P>

described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (&ldquo;<U>Qualifying Income</U>&rdquo;) and Parent has $1,000,000 of
income from unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which

below in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(d)</U> or (y) an opinion from Parent&rsquo;s outside counsel as described below in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(d)</U>,

secure the Company&rsquo;s obligation to pay these amounts, the Company shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Company on such terms (subject to this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(d)</U>) as
shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination
Payment pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(d)</U> shall be made at the time the Company is obligated to pay such amount to Parent
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.3</U> by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment in escrow
or any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following:
(i)&nbsp;a letter from the Company&rsquo;s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow
agent to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and Parent has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during
such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which
case the escrow agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (ii)&nbsp;a letter from Parent&rsquo;s counsel indicating that (A)&nbsp;Parent
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B)&nbsp;Parent&rsquo;s
outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Payment should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code,
in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Termination Payment to Parent. The Company agrees to amend this
<U>Section&nbsp;8.3(d)</U> at the reasonable request of Parent in order to (i)&nbsp;maximize the portion of the Termination Payment
that may be distributed from escrow to Parent hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, (ii)&nbsp;improve Parent&rsquo;s chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(d)</U>
or (iii)&nbsp;assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(d)</U>.
Any amount of the Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during
the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this <U>Section&nbsp;8.3(d)</U>, <U>provided</U> that the obligation
of the Company to pay the unpaid portion of the Termination Payment shall terminate on the December&nbsp;31 following the date
which is five (5) years from the date of this Agreement.</P>

Performance</U>. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be

failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge
and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
