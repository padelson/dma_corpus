formerly represented thereby.

  



  

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent or the Surviving Entity
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection
by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of
transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of Transmittal
shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as the Company
and Parent may reasonably agree upon prior to the Closing (it being understood
that the forms of Letter of Transmittal to be mailed to the holders of
Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred stock may vary in certain respects due to differences in
the respective securities), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, previously represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the applicable Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, formerly represented by such
Certificate by check or wire transfer, to be mailed or delivered by wire
transfer within two (2) Business Days following the later to occur of (A) the
Effective Time or (B) the Exchange Agent's receipt of such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
customary exchange practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed, at any time after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_.
No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates.

  



  

(iii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent or the Surviving
Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue and deliver to each holder of
Book-Entry Shares and each holder of Class B Units a check or wire transfer
representing the applicable Merger Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_ or
_Section 3.1(b)(ii)_ , as applicable, in each case without such holder being
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the
Exchange Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares and Class B Units shall then be
canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
Book-Entry Shares or Class B Units on the Merger Consideration payable in

applicable, it shall be a condition of payment that any Certificate
surrendered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section
3.2(c)_ shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for
transfer, or any Book-Entry Share or Class B Unit, as applicable, shall be
properly transferred, and that the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer Taxes and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Class B Unit surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable.

(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock and holders of Class B Units on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock and Class B Units who have not theretofore received
any Merger Consideration to which they are entitled under this  _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only to, in the case of former holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, Parent and the Surviving Entity,

shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock or Class B Units in respect of any part of the Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of any such shares or units immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Entity or the Surviving Partnership, as
applicable, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or
their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Company Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
then-outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock shall become fully vested
and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such number of
shares of Company Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon such
acceleration to satisfy any applicable income and employment withholding
Taxes (assuming a fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock equal
to the closing price of the Company Common Stock on the last completed trading
day immediately prior to the Closing); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any
such deduction or withholding would result in the issuance of a fractional
share, the Company may pay such holder an amount in cash equal to the fair
market value of such fractional share in lieu thereof. All shares of Company
Common Stock then-outstanding as a result of the full vesting of the shares
of Company Restricted Stock and the satisfaction of any applicable income and
employment withholding Taxes shall have the right to receive the Merger

(b) _Company Performance Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(x) with respect to a Company Employee employed on the Closing Date, 100% of
the target number of shares of Company Common Stock under any then-
outstanding Company Performance Shares held by such Company Employee
shall become fully earned and settled, and (y) with respect to a former
Company Employee whose employment terminated prior to the Closing Date and
who following termination was entitled to retain any then outstanding Company
Performance Shares in accordance with the terms of such award, a number of
shares of Company Common Stock equal to 100% of the target number of shares of
Company Common Stock under any Company Performance Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days from and after January 1, 2013 that
such former Company Employee was employed by the Company and the denominator
of which is 1,095, shall become fully earned and settled. In each case, the
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such number of shares of
Company Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon such settlement to satisfy any
applicable income and employment withholding Taxes (assuming a fair market
value of a share of Company Common Stock equal to the closing price of the
Company Common Stock on the last completed trading day immediately prior to
the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such deduction or
withholding would result in the issuance of a fractional share, the Company
may pay such holder an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such
fractional share in lieu thereof. All shares of Company Common Stock then-
outstanding as a result of such settled Company Performance Shares and the
satisfaction of any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes shall
have the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will pay to the holder of a Performance Share that becomes fully
earned and settled pursuant to this _Section 3.3(b)_ the amount of any cash
dividend equivalent that has accrued with respect to such Performance Share.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to (i) effectuate
the provisions of this _Section 3.3_ and (ii) to terminate all Company Stock
Plans effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall

shall be subject to review and reasonable approval by Parent) not later than
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Withholding Rights_. Each and any Parent Party, the Surviving
Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as such Parent
Party, the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by a
Parent Party, the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Parent Party, the Surviving Entity,
the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

Section 4.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The Company has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis)
to, the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required
to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from
and after January 1, 2010 (collectively, and including any exhibits thereto
and all documents and information incorporated by reference therein, the "
_Company SEC Filings_ "). Each Company SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented,
if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the
date of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became
effective in the case of registration statements), or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement
thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, no Company
Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated
by reference in the Company SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated,
if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared
(except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such
consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of
the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants, except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have devised
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in
accordance with management's authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets
is permitted only in accordance with management's authorization; (4) the
reporting of such assets is compared with existing assets at regular
intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are
recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to
effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. The Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed
to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal controls, and the Company has made available to
Parent copies of any material written materials relating to the foregoing.
The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company required
to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those
entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in the
Company's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer
(as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the Company.

  



  

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on the
Company's most recent consolidated balance sheet (or, in the notes thereto)
included in the Company SEC Filings, none of the Company or its consolidated
subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or
obligations (i) expressly contemplated by or under this Agreement, including
_Section 6.1_ hereof, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since the most recent consolidated balance
sheet set forth in the Company SEC Filings filed with the SEC on or prior to
the date of this Agreement, (iii) described in any section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or (iv) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

the subject of ongoing SEC review, and the Company has not received any
comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Filings since
January 1, 2010, that remain unresolved, nor has it received any written
inquiry or information request from the SEC as to any matters affecting the
Company that has not been adequately addressed. The Company has made available
to Parent true and complete copies of all written comment letters from the
staff of the SEC received since January 1, 2010, through the date of this
Agreement relating to the Company SEC Filings and all written responses of
the Company thereto through the date of this Agreement. None of the Company
SEC Filings is the subject of any confidential treatment request by the
Company.

and the date hereof, except as contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth
in _Section 4.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and each
Company Subsidiary has conducted its business in all material respects in the
ordinary course. Between January 1, 2013 and the date hereof, there has not

circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate with all other

Section 6.3 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement
in preliminary form. Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself,
its Affiliates and the holders of its stock to the Company and provide such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Proxy
Statement shall include all information reasonably requested by such other
party to be included therein. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the
Proxy Statement received from the SEC and advise Parent of any oral comments
with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable
to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, the Company shall cooperate and provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response).

  



  

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that such document
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of
any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the
extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this
_Section 6.3(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section
6.3(a)_. For purposes of _Section 4.8_, _Section 5.4_ and this _Section
6.3_, any information concerning or related to the Company, its Affiliates or
the Company Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the
Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent or its
Affiliates (including Merger Sub) will be deemed to have been provided by
Parent.

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and
Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be required to hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting prior to the No Shop Period Start Date. The Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company
entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable
after the No Shop Period Start Date, it being understood and agreed that
during the period between the date that the Proxy Statement is filed in
preliminary form with the SEC and the No Shop Period Start Date, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to finalize the Proxy Statement
for the purpose of having the Proxy Statement in substantially final form by
the No Shop Period Start Date. The Company shall, through the Company Board,
recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder
Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made an
Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section 6.5_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3(c)_, if, on a date for which
the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present,
the Company shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements
or adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_  that the
Company Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is
more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Company Stockholder
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable Law). The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, its obligations
to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to this _Section 6.3(c)_
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal or by any
Adverse Recommendation Change.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and

cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to the Parent
Parties, Parent's financing sources and their respective Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice to all of their respective properties, offices, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, each of the

schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws,

(b) Prior to the Closing, with the prior written consent of the Company

reasonable access during normal business hours in order to prepare or
cause to be prepared surveys, inspections, engineering studies, environmental
assessments and other tests, examinations or studies with respect to each
Company Property that the Parent Parties deem to be reasonably necessary
(collectively, " _Tests_ "), so long as such Tests do not damage any property
or any portion thereof in any material respect. The Parent Parties shall be
required to conduct such Tests in a manner so as not to significantly disturb
or interfere with the current use of the Company Properties, and upon
completion of such Tests, the Parent Parties agree at their sole expense to
restore the Company Properties in all material respects to their respective
conditions immediately prior to such Tests. The Parent Parties shall
indemnify, defend (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company
Parties), protect and hold the Company Parties and all Company Subsidiaries
harmless from and against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or
expense (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs), that the
Company Parties or any Company Subsidiaries sustain or incur by reason of or
in connection with any Tests conducted by the Parent Parties or their
Representatives relating to or in connection with the Company Properties, or
entry by the Parent Parties or their Representatives onto the Company
Properties, solely to the extent that such Tests or entries were the proximate
cause of any such losses, costs, damages or expense.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Parties shall not be required
by this _Section 6.4_ to provide the Parent Parties, Parent's financing
sources or their respective Representatives with access to or to disclose
information (x) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement
with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered
into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (y)
the disclosure of which would violate any Law or fiduciary duty ( _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company Parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or fiduciary duty) or (z)
that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the
extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney
work product or other legal privilege).

  



  

(d) The Parent Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any disruption to the business of the Company Parties or any Company
Subsidiaries that may result from any requests for access, data or
information hereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, without prior notice to
and reasonable consultation with the Company, each of the Parent Parties
shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates
not to, contact or otherwise communicate with the employees of the Company
Parties or any Company Subsidiary (other than those employees set forth on
_Section 6.4(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) or tenants, lenders or
other parties with which the Company Parties or any Company Subsidiary has a
business relationship regarding the business of the Company Parties and the
Company Subsidiaries or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(f) The Company Parties agree to give prompt written notice to the Parent
Parties upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any
event or circumstance relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries which
could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

discussions or negotiations or the making of any Company Acquisition
Proposal. No later than one (1) Business Day after the No Shop Period Start

agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or any of its Representatives from
(A) (1) informing any Third Party of the provisions set forth in this

Person) that made any Company Acquisition Proposals solely for the purpose of
seeking clarification of solely those terms or conditions of such Company
Acquisition Proposal that require clarification so as to determine whether
such Company Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Proposal; and (B) to the extent the Relevant Period extends beyond
the No Shop Period Start Date with respect to any Qualified Go Shop Proposal,
continuing to engage during such portion of the Relevant Period in the
activities described in _Section 6.5(a)_  with respect to the Go Shop Bidder

Business Days of the request of Parent and/or reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of the request of Parent (any of
the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this _Section
6.5(e)_, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (v) approve, adopt,
declare advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve,
adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause the Company to enter into,
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.5_
). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ if the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) (x) has received a _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not a Qualified Go Shop Proposal or from a Go Shop Bidder) that, in the
good faith determination of the Company Board (or any committee thereof),
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not
withdrawn, and (y) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors' duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall be entitled to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 6.5(e)_ unless:

  



   

64 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(i) the Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") to Parent and Merger Sub that the Company intends to take such
action, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor and describing
the material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the
Superior Proposal and the terms of any and all agreements in connection
therewith, including any financing arrangements, that is the basis of such
action (it being understood that such material terms shall include the
identity of the Third Party);

  



  

(ii) during the four (4) Business Day period following Parent's and Merger
Sub's receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in
good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(iii) following the close of business on the last day of the four (4)
Business Day period, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have
determined in good faith (x) after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, taking into account any changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub in response to the Notice of
Superior Proposal, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the directors' duties under
applicable Law; and

  



  

(iv) in connection with such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
promptly thereafter terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ , concurrently pays the Termination Payment pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ and then promptly enters into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.

  



   

65 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

If, following such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board (or
applicable committee) determines not to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change because the Company Acquisition Proposal ceased to constitute a
Superior Proposal and thereafter any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material amendment of such Company Acquisition Proposal that previously
constituted a Superior Proposal occurs, such amendment shall require a
new Notice of Superior Proposal, and the Company shall be required to comply
again with the requirements of this _Section 6.5(e)_,  _provided_ that
references to the four (4) Business Day period above shall then be deemed to
be references to a two (2) Business Day period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall be obligated to negotiate with Parent and Merger
Sub for such two (2) Business Day period pursuant to the foregoing sentence
on only one occasion if, but only if, the Company Acquisition
Proposal relates to a Qualified Go Shop Proposal before (y) the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) can effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or (z)
the Company can terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ , in
each case, with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof),
directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from disclosing to the
Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, an express
rejection of any applicable Company Acquisition Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation to the Company's stockholders in
favor of the Merger shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change;
and _provided_ _further_ that the taking of any such position or making of any
such disclosure contemplated by this _Section 6.5(f)_ shall not affect the
Company's obligations under this _Section 6.5_.

  



  

(g) At the No Shop Period Start Date, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and employees shall, and
the Company shall instruct its and the Company Subsidiaries' Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions, negotiations or communications with any Third Party conducted
prior to the No Shop Period Start Date with respect to any
Company Acquisition Proposal and shall request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished
in connection therewith. From and after the No Shop Period Start Date, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors
and employees shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any
confidentiality provisions or provisions of similar effect to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or of which the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a beneficiary.

  



  

(h) From and after the No Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , the Company shall not amend or grant any waiver
or release under, or fail to enforce, any standstill or similar contract with
respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries unless the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' duties under
applicable Law.

Subsidiary representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated

determined on a book value basis, (iii) any issue, sale or other disposition
of (including by way of merger, consolidation, joint venture, business
combination, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, such
securities) representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power of
the Company, (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer in which any Person or
"group" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) shall seek to acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in

beneficial ownership, of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company, or (v)
any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other
similar type of transaction with respect to the Company in which a Third Party
shall acquire beneficial ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the term "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall
not include the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the
references in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" to "fifteen
percent (15%)" shall be replaced by "more than fifty percent (50%)") made by
a Third Party after the date hereof that did not result from a breach of
_Section 6.5(b)_ on terms that the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and any other aspects of the transaction described in such
proposal, including the identity of the Person making such proposal,
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation, as well as any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent and Merger Sub in response to such proposal or otherwise,
to be (A) more favorable to the holders of the Company Common Stock (solely
in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) reasonably likely to
receive all required governmental approvals on a timely basis and otherwise
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed.

which any Company Party or any Company Subsidiary is party or by which any
Company Party or any Company Subsidiary is bound to the extent necessary to
consummate the Mergers and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including all prepayment, defeasance or other fees and penalties

this _Section 6.6_ , the parties shall cooperate in good faith with respect
to accommodations that may be reasonably requested or appropriate to obtain
such consents.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.6_ to the contrary, no
approval, waiver or consent from, nor any notice to, any Third Party (other
than a Governmental Authority that is required by Law) with respect to this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated herein shall be

Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Company Parties shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and

untrue or inaccurate such that the applicable closing conditions
would reasonably expected to be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside
Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to provide such prompt
notice under this _Section 6.7(b)_ pursuant to clause (i) above shall not
constitute a breach of a covenant for purposes of _Section 7.2(b)_.

the Parent Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company Parties, of any

_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without obtaining the other
parties' consent, issue such press release or make such public statement
or filing as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of any
stock exchange or the applicable provisions of any listing agreement of any
party hereto, provided that such party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such press release
or making any such public statement with respect to this Agreement or any of

Section 6.9 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Entity shall provide exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for each Indemnitee, which is at least as favorable
in scope and amount to such Indemnitee as the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided to such Indemnitee by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, immediately prior to
the Effective Time in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws or the
applicable Company Subsidiary's respective articles or certificates of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents),
as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses shall cover actions and omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including all transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of  _Section 6.9(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity to): (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnitee against
and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent such Action arises out of or pertains to (x)
any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitee's
capacity as a director, officer, partner, manager, member, trustee, employee
or agent of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or of any other
corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company,
trust, association, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for whom such
person served in such capacity at the request of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Mergers; and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such Action the expenses (including attorneys' fees and
any expenses incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with enforcing any
rights with respect to indemnification or advancement of expenses) of any
Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that
such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Entity
(i) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnitee to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is
prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnitee shall
promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the amount of all such
expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto with respect to which such
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
coverage afforded by the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each
case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from one or more
insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions and retentions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
coverage provided under the Company's existing policies and with limits of
liability that are no lower than the limits on the Company's existing policies
as long as the annual premium in the aggregate does not exceed 175% of the
annual aggregate premium(s) under the Company's existing policies. If the
Company or the Surviving Entity for any reason fails to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Entity shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
coverage provided under the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof,
or (ii) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide,
for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time,
the Indemnitees who are insured under the Company's DandO Insurance with
comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier, that is no less
favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of the Company (which may
be provided under Parent's directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable,
the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies are intended to be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.9_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his
or her successors, heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or
representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in successfully
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.9_.

  



  

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.9_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person or any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee or any employee with the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries listed in _Section 4.12_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
6.9_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7_ to
the contrary, this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Mergers indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries,
and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.9_. The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees
the payment and performance of the Surviving Entity's obligations pursuant to
this _Section 6.9_.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Termination of Certain Obligations_. Unless otherwise notified
by Parent in writing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to terminate all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code that include a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "
_Company 401(k) Plans_ "), in each case effective immediately prior to the
Closing. If a Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, the Company shall provide
Parent with evidence of such termination pursuant to resolutions of the
Company Board (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date. In the event of any such termination, Parent shall cause each Company
Employee who is eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) Plans and
following the Closing continues as an employee of the Surviving Entity or
becomes an employee of Parent's advisor, AR Capital, LLC ( " _Advisor_
") (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") to be eligible to
participate as of the date immediately following the Closing Date in a plan
of the Parent or one of its Affiliates or of Advisor, as applicable, intended
to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that includes a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the
Code (a " _Continuing 401(k) Plan_ ") and the Continuing Employees' service
with the Company and any predecessor shall be recognized for eligibility and
vesting purposes under the applicable Continuing 401(k) Plan to the same
extent as recognized under the Company 401(k) Plans solely to the extent such
recognition of service for eligibility or vesting does not have a
negative impact on the applicable Continuing 401(k) Plan's tax qualified
status. Further, in the event of any such termination, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Continuing 401(k) Plan
to accept direct rollovers from a Company 401(k) Plan with respect to
accounts of the applicable Continuing Employees, which rollover may consist of
cash, a promissory note (as described below) or any combination thereof from
such Company 401(k) Plan. The Company shall ensure that the Company

_Section_ \\\t \\\\* MERGEFORMAT  _8.3(a)(i)_ , the references to "fifteen
percent (15%)" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)"; or

  



  

(ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ , then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee together with the
Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by

_however_ , that in the event of a termination by the Company pursuant to

Agreement with respect to an Unmatched Superior Proposal during the Relevant
Period, the amount of the Termination Fee payable to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ shall be $11,000,000; or

  



  

(iii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ , then the Company shall

Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
Parent, within two (2) Business Days of such termination; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such termination by Parent relates to an Unmatched

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that:

  



  

(i) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee or Expense Amount, as applicable, earlier than one (1)
full Business Day after receipt of appropriate wire transfer instructions

(ii) the Company's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ during the Relevant Period and pay the Termination Fee
set forth in the proviso to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ shall not be prejudiced by

Relevant Period; and

  



   

82 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(iii) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Payment is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Parent in
the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a final and non-
appealable judgment against the Company for the payment of any amount set
forth in this _Section 8.3_, the Company shall pay Parent its Expenses in

rate of five percent (5%) for the period from the date such payment was
required to be made through the date such payment was actually received, or
such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment is
required to be paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement by wire

accordance with this _Section 8.3(d)_. In the event that the Company is
obligated to pay Parent the Termination Payment, the amount payable to Parent
in any tax year of Parent shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Termination
Payment of the Parent and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be
paid to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of
Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and
Parent has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which
is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income
which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by Parent's
independent accountants, plus (B) in the event Parent receives either (x) a
letter from Parent's counsel indicating that Parent has received a ruling from
the IRS as described below in this _Section 8.3(d)_ or (y) an opinion from
Parent's outside counsel as described below in this _Section 8.3(d)_, an
amount equal to the excess of the Termination Payment less the amount payable
under clause (A) above.

  



  

(i) To secure the Company's obligation to pay these amounts, the Company
shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Termination Payment
with an escrow agent selected by the Company on such terms (subject to this
_Section 8.3(d)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent
and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the
Termination Payment pursuant to this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be made at the
time the Company is obligated to pay such amount to Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the
Termination Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to
Parent unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the
following: (i) a letter from the Company's independent accountants indicating
the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without
causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income and Parent has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources
during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (ii) a letter from Parent's
counsel indicating that (A) Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding
that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Payment would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B) Parent's outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent of the
Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the
Termination Payment to Parent. The Company agrees to amend this  _Section
8.3(d)_ at the reasonable request of Parent in order to (i) maximize the
portion of the Termination Payment that may be distributed from escrow to
Parent hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve Parent's chances of
securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 8.3(d)_ or (iii)
assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel
as described in this _Section 8.3(d)_. Any amount of the Termination Payment
that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as
possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this _Section 8.3(d)_, _provided_ that the obligation of the
Company to pay the unpaid portion of the Termination Payment shall terminate
on the December 31 following the date which is five (5) years from the date
of this Agreement.

governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall
not be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form
of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of
Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules of any stock exchange requires the further approval of the stockholders
of the Company without such further approval of such stockholders, or (b) any
amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

  



  

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject
to the proviso of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement or
condition contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any party hereto in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder.

Notes Redemption, the Trust Preferred Securities Redemption, and the
prepayment of all amounts under the Loan Agreements or the prepayments,
consents, waivers or approvals under any other contracts, agreements or
instruments, in accordance with _Section 6.6(c)_ and (ii) the Company and
Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement, other than attorneys' and accountants'
fees.

preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax,
" _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity and the Surviving Partnership shall pay or cause to be paid, without
deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders
of the Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Class B Units, all
Transfer Taxes.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall include the
Company Disclosure Letter. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Appendix or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article
or Section of, or an Appendix or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other instrument made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by
succession of comparable successor Laws. References to a Person are also to
its successors and permitted assigns. All references to "dollars" or
"$" refer to currency of the United States of America.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or
future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Other than to the Surviving Entity and
the Surviving Partnership, neither this Agreement nor any rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole
or in part, by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

  



  

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for the provisions of _Section 6.9_ (which shall be to the benefit of the
Persons referred to in such section). The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with _Section 8.5_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto and may have
been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of this
Agreement. Accordingly, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely
upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations
of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of
any other date.

  



  

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Actions (whether based
on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Maryland, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws provision
or rule (whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Maryland.
