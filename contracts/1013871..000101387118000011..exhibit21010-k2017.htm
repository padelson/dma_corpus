agrees to purchase from Seller, all of the right, title and interest of Seller
in and to the Acquired Interests at the Closing on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

2.02 Payment of Purchase Price. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth, in consideration of the delivery by Seller of the
Acquired Interests, Purchaser shall by wire transfer of immediately available
United States funds to an account or accounts that have been designated by

plus (b) the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount, minus (c) the
Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount, minus (d) the aggregate amount of
Leakage set forth in the Leakage/Indebtedness Certificate, minus (e) the
aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Company Entities as of the Closing
Date set forth in the Leakage/Indebtedness Certificate. The Base Purchase
Price shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 5.06 (such adjusted amount,
the "Final Purchase Price").

2.03 Closing.

(a) The closing of the transactions described in Section 2.01 (the "Closing")
will take place at the offices of Jones Day, counsel to Seller, at 250 Vesey
Street, New York, NY 10281-1047, or at such other place as the Parties
mutually agree, at 10 A.M. local time, on the first (1st) day of the calendar
month ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the conditions set
forth in Article 7 and Article 8 have been either satisfied or waived by the
party for whose benefit such condition exists (or at such other time as the
Parties mutually agree).

(b) At the Closing, the following shall occur:

(i) Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to (a) the Base Purchase Price, plus
(b) the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount, minus (c) the
Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount, minus (d) the aggregate amount of
Leakage set forth in the Leakage/Indebtedness Certificate, minus (e) the
aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Company Entities as of the Closing
Date set forth in the Leakage/Indebtedness Certificate by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Seller's account as provided on Exhibit B; and

(ii) The Parties shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the other Parties
the certificates and other deliverables pursuant to Article 7 and Article 8. 

2.04 Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount.

(a) Prior to the earlier of (x) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior
to the scheduled Closing Date and (y) the date that is five (5) Business Days
after completion of the audit contemplated by Section 5.13, Seller will
prepare and deliver to Purchaser a worksheet setting forth Seller's good faith
estimate of the Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount as of the Balance Sheet
Effective Date (the "Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount"), as well
as a computation thereof (which computation shall be prepared (i) in
accordance with GAAP and (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with GAAP, the
Company Accounting Principles).

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare (at
Purchaser's expense) and deliver to Seller a worksheet setting forth
Purchaser's good faith computation of the actual Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount as of the Balance Sheet Effective Date (the "Proposed Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount"), which computation shall be prepared (i) in
accordance with GAAP and (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with GAAP, the
Company Accounting Principles, together with a reasonably detailed explanation
of, and documentation reasonably sufficient to confirm the accuracy of the
computation of, such Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount. If within
thirty (30) days following delivery of such worksheet and supporting
documentation, Seller does not object in writing thereto to Purchaser, then
the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount shall constitute the actual
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount as of the Closing Date for purposes of
this Agreement (the "Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount"). If, within
thirty (30) days following delivery of such worksheet and supporting
documentation, Seller objects in writing thereto to Purchaser (describing in
reasonable detail the specific line items and values that are in dispute and
the reasons for such dispute, and proposing alternative values with respect to
such specific line items) such Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount
shall be subject to the objection and resolution provisions set forth in
Section 2.04(e) below.

(c) If the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is not prepared and
delivered by Purchaser within the sixty (60) day period set forth in Section
2.04(b) above, Seller shall be entitled (but not obligated) during the sixty
(60) day period commencing on the sixty-first (61st) day after the Closing
Date to prepare (at Seller's expense) and deliver to Purchaser a worksheet
setting forth Seller's good faith computation of the Proposed Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount, which computation shall be prepared in the same format
and on the same basis used to prepare the Estimated Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount, and based upon information available to Seller, and
accompanied by the documentation that supports Seller's determinations and
calculations. If within ten (10) days following delivery of such worksheet and
supporting documentation, Purchaser does not object in writing thereto to
Seller, then the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount submitted by
Seller pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall constitute the Final Aggregate
Net Working Capital Amount. If, within ten (10) days following delivery of
such worksheet and supporting documentation, Purchaser objects in writing
thereto to Seller (describing in reasonable detail the specific line items and
values that are in dispute and the reasons for such dispute, and proposing
alternative values with respect to such specific line items), such Proposed
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount shall be subject to the objection and
resolution provisions set forth in Section 2.04(e) below.

(d) If neither Purchaser nor Seller prepare and timely deliver a Proposed
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount in accordance with Section 2.04(b) or
(c), above, the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount delivered at
Closing shall become the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount for all
purposes hereunder.

(e) If Seller timely objects to Purchaser's Proposed Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or if Purchaser timely objects to
Seller's Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount pursuant to Section
2.04(c), then Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and attempt
to resolve the particular items and values that are identified in the
applicable written notice of objection over a 

twenty (20) day period commencing on delivery of written notice of objection
pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or (c), as the case may be. Should such
negotiations not result in an agreement as to the Final Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount within such twenty (20) day period (or such longer period as
Purchaser and Seller may mutually agree), then either Purchaser or Seller may
submit such disputed items and values to the Neutral Auditor. Each Party
agrees to promptly execute a reasonable engagement letter, if requested to do
so by the Neutral Auditor. Purchaser and Seller, and their respective
Representatives, shall cooperate fully with the Neutral Auditor. The Neutral
Auditor, acting as an expert and not an arbitrator, shall resolve such
disputed items and determine the values to be ascribed thereto, and using
those values (together with other items not in dispute) determine the Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount as of the Closing Date only (prepared on
the same basis used to prepare the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount). The Parties hereby agree that the Neutral Auditor shall only decide
the specific disputed items, the values ascribed thereto and using those
values (together with the other items included in the applicable Proposed
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount) determine the Final Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount, and the Neutral Auditor's decision with respect to
such disputed items and values must be within the range of values assigned to
each such item in the applicable Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount
and the notice of objection, respectively. All fees and expenses relating to
the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor will be borne equally
by Purchaser and Seller. The Neutral Auditor shall be directed to resolve the
disputed items and amounts and deliver to Purchaser and Seller a written
determination of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount (such
determination to be made consistent with this Section 2.04(e), including a
worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination and to be based solely on information provided to the Neutral
Auditor by Purchaser and Seller) within thirty (30) days after being retained
(or such longer period as the Neutral Auditor may reasonably require), which
determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and their
respective Affiliates and representatives, successors and assigns.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the dispute resolution
mechanism contained in this Section 2.04(e) shall be the exclusive mechanism
for resolving disputes, if any, regarding the Aggregate Net Working Capital,
if any, and neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Article 11 for Losses resulting or arising from the amount of the
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount or the determination of Aggregate Net
Working Capital.

(f) The "Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount" shall
be the amount equal to (i) the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount
minus (ii) the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount. If the Post-
Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a positive amount,
then Purchaser shall pay in cash to Seller the amount of the Post-Closing
Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Post-Closing Aggregate
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, then Seller shall
pay in cash to Purchaser the amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-
Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. Any such net excess
or deficit payment in respect of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount will be due and payable within fifteen (15) days after the Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is finally determined as provided in this
Section 2.04 and will be payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account or accounts as shall be specified by Purchaser or
Seller, as applicable. Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.04(f)
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(g) Following the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate and provide
each other and, if applicable the Neutral Auditor, and their respective
representatives, reasonable assistance and access to such books, records and
employees (including those of the Company and the Subsidiaries) as are
reasonably requested in connection with the matters addressed in this Section
2.04. Consistent with the foregoing, if Purchaser prepares the worksheet in
accordance with Section 2.04(b), Purchaser shall, at its expense, provide or
provide reasonable access (in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to its
business) to Seller or the Neutral Auditor to review the books and records,
documents and work papers related to the preparation of the worksheet and
computation of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount and if Seller
prepares the 

worksheet in accordance with Section 2.04(c), then Seller shall, at its
expense, provide or provide reasonable access (in a manner not unreasonably
disruptive to its business) to Purchaser or the Neutral Auditor to review the
books and records, documents and work papers related to the preparation of the
worksheet and computation of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount.
If Purchaser prepares the worksheet in accordance with Section 2.04(b), Seller
and the Neutral Auditor shall be entitled to make reasonable inquiries and
information requests of Purchaser regarding the worksheet setting forth the
computation of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount and the
calculations set forth therein and if Seller prepares the worksheet in
accordance with Section 2.04(c), Purchaser and the Neutral Auditor shall be
entitled to make reasonable inquiries and information requests of Seller
regarding the worksheet setting forth the computation of the Final Aggregate
Net Working Capital Amount and the calculations set forth therein.

Agreements. Neither Seller nor any Company Entity has been informed in writing

treatment, transportation, manufacture, handling, production, or release of
any Hazardous Substance.

to license, sublicense, agreement or permission, in each case free and clear
of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, any intellectual property necessary

Purchaser has deemed necessary and appropriate in order for Purchaser to
investigate to its satisfaction the Business and properties of the Company
Entities sufficiently to make an informed investment decision to purchase the
Acquired Interests and to enter into this Agreement. Purchaser (either alone
or together with its Representatives) has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its purchase of the Acquired Interests and is capable of bearing
the economic risks of such purchase. Purchaser's acceptance of the Acquired
Interests on the Closing Date shall be based upon its own investigation,
examination and determination with respect thereto as to all matters and
without reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of
any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller, except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 4.12 shall in any way diminish the liability of Seller with respect to
a breach of a representation or warranty expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

of its investment decision to purchase the Acquired Interests and to enter
into this Agreement and not on the advice of Seller or its Representatives.
Purchaser acknowledges that any financial projections that may have been
provided to it are based on assumptions of future operating results based on
assumptions about certain events (many of which are beyond the control of
Seller). It understands that no assurances or representations can be given
that the actual results of the operations of any Company Entity will conform
to the projected results for any period. Except with respect to any
representation or warranty expressly set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser
specifically acknowledges that no representation or warranty has been made,
and that Purchaser has not relied on any representation or warranty, as to the
accuracy of any projections, estimates or budgets, future revenues, future
results from operations, future cash flows, the future condition of any
Project or any assets of any Company Entity, the future financial condition of
such Company Entity, or any other information or documents made available to
Purchaser, its Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives.

necessary for Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder. Purchaser acknowledges that
receipt or availability of funds or financing by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates shall not be a condition to Purchaser's obligations hereunder.

been derived from, or constitute, either directly or indirectly, the proceeds
of any criminal activity under the anti-money laundering laws of the United
States.

all right, title and interest in and to the Entergy Litigation Client Trust

with the applicable Governmental Authority such amendment or supplement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall provide
Purchaser (or its advisors), upon request, copies of all correspondence
between Seller or any of its Affiliates (including any Company Entity) and any
Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given

that none of Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives,
shall conduct any environmental site assessment, compliance evaluation or

written consent of Seller (it being understood and agreed that Seller may have
no such authority, whether contractual or otherwise, to consent to such
undertakings with respect to any Project) and without ongoing consultation
with Seller with respect to any such activity (it being understood and agreed
that in no event shall any subsurface investigation or testing of any
environmental media be conducted); provided, further, that, for the avoidance
of doubt, none of Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives shall have any right to access or review any Tax Return of
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including any consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Return including any such entity), except for separate Tax Returns
of the Company Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its
Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser with
information contained in such returns, or derived from those returns without
undue burden, that is reasonably requested by Purchaser and relevant to its
tax due diligence. All requests for access to the offices, properties, books

foregoing indemnification obligation shall survive the Closing or termination
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall not be required to provide any access or
information to Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives which Seller reasonably believes it or the Company Entities
are prohibited from providing to Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives by reason of applicable Law, which constitutes or allows
access to information protected by attorney-client privilege, or which Seller
or the Company Entities are required to keep confidential or prevent access to

any Seller or any of its Affiliates to a material risk of Liability. For
purposes of this Section 5.02(a), Purchaser's Representatives shall include
the Financing Sources.

extent that would be required if Seller were a "Receiving Party" pursuant to
the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, the obligations of Seller set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall remain in full force and
effect following the execution of this Agreement and shall survive any
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms 

5.03 Exhibits and Schedules; Notification of Certain Matters.

(a) All exhibits and schedules and the Disclosure Schedules attached hereto
are hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation nor
the mere inclusion of any item in a schedule or in the Disclosure Schedules as
an exception to a representation or warranty shall be deemed an admission by a
Party that such item represents a material fact, event or circumstance or that
such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company Entities or Purchaser.

(c) Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to deliver to
Purchaser, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a
supplement to the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Closing Date Schedule
Supplement") to disclose any matter arising or discovered after the date
hereof, that, if existing at, or arising or discovered prior to the date
hereof, would have been required to be set forth in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule for the representations and warranties of Seller set forth herein to
be true and correct as of the date hereof, and the Seller Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to be modified, supplemented and amended to include the items
listed in the Closing Date Schedule Supplement for all purposes hereunder,
other than to cure any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
of Seller contained in this Agreement for purposes of ARTICLE 11. If any item
set forth in the Closing Date Schedule Supplement discloses any event,
circumstance or development that, individually or in the aggregate when taken
together with other previously disclosed events, circumstances or
developments, would prevent any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 to
be satisfied, then Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by delivering notice
of termination to Seller within twenty (20) Business Days of its receipt of
such Closing Date Schedule Supplement; provided, that if Purchaser does not
deliver such notice within such twenty (20) Business Day period, then
Purchaser shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived their right to terminate
this Agreement with respect to such item and their right to not consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby with respect to such item, in each case,
after giving effect to such item under any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01, but shall not be deemed to have irrevocably waived their right
to indemnification under Section 11.01 with respect to such item.

operated in the ordinary course of business consistent with Laws and Permits,
past practice, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve,

during the Interim Period, Seller shall provide Purchaser with reports (the

Entity, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (other than a Company

reasonably requested in connection with its review and verification of the
Interim Reports.

provision of such services; (iii) use reasonable efforts to replace any such
employees whose employment with Seller and its Affiliates terminates, or who
otherwise cease to spend the majority of their working time to the provision

in any wholesale power market in the United States; and (iv) not materially
alter the methodology for compensating any such employees (including incentive

(a) From and after the Closing Date, except as provided in Section 5.05(b),
(x) the Company Entities shall cease to be insured by, have access or
availability to, be entitled to make claims on, be entitled to claim benefits
or seek coverage under, any of Seller's or its Affiliates' insurance policies
or any of their self-insured programs for any event or occurrence after the
Closing; and (y) Purchaser shall be solely responsible for obtaining or
providing insurance coverage for the Company Entities for any event or
occurrence after the Closing sufficient to comply with any and all of the
contractual and statutory obligations of the Company Entities.

(b) Seller shall transfer, or cause to be transferred, to Purchaser at the
Closing the Company Entities' excess liability retroactive dates. Furthermore,
Purchaser shall be entitled to make claims on and seek coverage under Seller's
or its Affiliates' insurance policies, and negotiate and control the
resolution and settlement with those insurers, for claims which arise relating
to incidents that occurred before the Closing Date. This right is limited to
recourse to such insurance policies to the extent such claims are covered by
such insurance policies, and not recourse to any self-insured program of
Seller or its Affiliates. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed or delivered, all such documents
and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or
other actions as may be necessary to assist Purchaser with the foregoing.

5.06 Risk of Loss; Casualty. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
5.06, during the Interim Period, all risk of loss or damage to the property or
assets of the ProjectCos including the Projects, shall, as between Purchaser
and Seller, be borne by Seller unless such loss is caused or created by
Purchaser. If during the Interim Period, the property or assets of the
ProjectCos, including the Projects, are damaged by fire or other casualty
(each such event, an "Event of Loss"), or are taken by a Governmental
Authority by exercise of the power of eminent domain (each, a "Taking"), then
the following provisions of this Section 5.06 shall apply:

(a) Following the occurrence of (i) any one or more Events of Loss, if the
aggregate costs to restore, repair or replace the property or assets of the
ProjectCos subject to such Event of Loss to a condition reasonably comparable
to its or their condition prior to such Event of Loss, plus the amount of any
lost profits reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as a direct result of
such Event of Loss (such amount pursuant to this clause (i) to be determined
by an independent third party appraiser mutually selected by the Parties
(collectively, "Restoration Costs")) and/or (ii) any one or more Takings, if
the value of the property subject to such Taking plus the amount of any lost
profits reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as a direct result of such
Taking, less any condemnation award received by Purchaser (provided, that any
such condemnation award is made available to Purchaser) (such amount pursuant
to this clause (ii) to be determined by an independent third party appraiser
mutually selected by the Parties (collectively, the "Condemnation Value")),
is, in the aggregate, less than or equal to one percent (1%) of the Base
Purchase Price, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), net of and after
giving effect to (A) any insurance, condemnation award or other third party
proceeds reasonably expected to be available to the applicable ProjectCos of
Seller for such event, (B) any tax benefits related thereto, and (C) any
amounts expended by the applicable Project Company or Seller prior to Closing
to restore damage caused by such casualty event there shall be no effect on
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Subject to the termination right of Purchaser and Seller set forth in
Section 5.06(d), upon the occurrence of any one or more Events of Loss and/or
Takings involving aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value in excess
of one percent (1%) of the Base Purchase Price (a "Major Loss"), Seller shall
have, in the case of a Major Loss relating solely to one or more Events of
Loss, the option, exercised by notice to Purchaser, to restore, repair or
replace the damaged assets or properties prior to Closing to a condition
comparable in all material respects to their condition prior to such Event of
Loss or Taking, as the case may be. If Seller elects to so restore, repair or
replace the assets or properties relating to a Major Loss, 

which election shall be made by notice to Purchaser prior to the Closing Date
and as soon as practicable following the occurrence of the Major Loss, Seller
will complete or cause to be completed the repair, replacement or restoration
of the damaged assets or property prior to the Closing and the Closing Date
shall be postponed for the amount of time reasonably necessary to complete the
restoration, repair or replacement of such property or assets as reasonably
agreed between Purchaser and Seller (including, if necessary, the extension of
the date contemplated by Section 12.01(b) (but for no more than thirty (30)
days) to allow for the restoration, repair or replacement of such assets or
properties). Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep
Purchaser reasonably informed with respect to such restoration, repair or
replacement, including, subject to its reasonable discretion, allowing
Purchaser to participate in meetings, communications and inspections
pertaining thereto, in order to enable Purchaser to evaluate the quality and
sufficiency thereof. If the Restoration Costs exceed $2,000,000 in the
aggregate, Seller will not grant its final acceptance of any such restoration,
repair or replacement without Purchaser's prior written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If Seller elects not to
cause the restoration, repair or replacement of the property or assets
affected by a Major Loss, or such Major Loss is the result in whole or in part
of one or more Takings or is otherwise not capable of being restored, repaired
or replaced, the provisions of Section 5.06(c) will apply.

(c) Subject to the termination right of Purchaser and Seller set forth in
Section 5.06(d), in the event that Seller elects not to cause the restoration,
repair or replacement of a Major Loss, or in the event that Seller, having
elected to cause repair, replacement or restoration of the Major Loss, fails
to cause its completion within the period of time agreed upon by the Parties
pursuant to Section 5.06(b) (subject to extension for up to ninety (90) days
for causes beyond Seller's control), or in the event that a Major Loss is the
result in whole or in part of one or more Takings or is otherwise not capable
of being restored, repaired or replaced, then the Parties shall, within thirty
(30) days following Seller's election not to cause the restoration, repair or
replacement, failure to complete, or the occurrence of such Major Loss, as the
case may be, adjust the Purchase Price downward by the aggregate Restoration
Cost and Condemnation Value, and proceed to Closing. To assist Purchaser in
its evaluation of any and all Events of Loss, Seller shall provide Purchaser
such access to the properties and assets and such information as Purchaser may
reasonably request in connection therewith.

(d) In the event that the aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value
with respect to one or more Events of Loss and/or Takings equals an amount in
excess of seven and one half percent (7.5%) of the Base Purchase Price, then
either Purchaser or Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement. 

5.07 Fulfillment of Conditions. Seller (a) shall take all commercially
reasonable steps necessary or desirable, and proceed diligently and in good
faith to satisfy each condition to the obligations of Seller contained in this
Agreement and (b) shall not, and shall not permit the Company, any Subsidiary
or any of its other Affiliates to, take or fail to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to result in the non-fulfillment of any such condition
or materially delay or impair the approval of any Governmental Authority.

5.08 Further Assurances. During the Interim Period, and post-Closing, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall
take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as may be
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including such actions at its expense as are necessary in connection with
obtaining any third-party consents and all Governmental Approvals required to
be obtained by Seller. During the Interim Period, Seller shall cooperate with
Purchaser and provide any information regarding Seller necessary to assist
Purchaser in making any filings or applications required to be made with any
Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, the transfer of
environmental Permits to Purchaser, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 5.08, if the Parties are in an
adversarial relationship in litigation or arbitration, the furnishing of any
documents or information in accordance herewith shall be solely subject to
applicable rules relating to discovery and the remainder of this Section 5.08
shall not apply.

5.09 Post-Closing Access; Preservation of Records. From and after the Closing,
Seller shall make or cause to be made available to Purchaser and its
Representatives all books, records and documents of Seller relating to the
Business (and the assistance of employees responsible for such books, records
and documents) during regular business hours for the same purposes, to the
extent applicable, as set forth in Section 6.06; provided, however, that
access to such books, records, documents and employees shall not interfere
with the normal operations of Seller and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
of Seller incurred in connection therewith shall be paid by Purchaser;
provided, further, that none of Purchaser, its Affiliates or their
Representatives shall have any right to access or review any Tax Return of
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including any consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Return including any such entity); provided, for the avoidance of
doubt, that the foregoing limitation shall not limit Purchaser's right to
receive information from Seller, including Tax Returns filed by Seller (but
not any Tax Return of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than Seller)) to
the extent that such information or Tax Return is reasonably necessary for (i)
investigating, settling, preparing for the defense or prosecution of,
defending or prosecuting any Action or Proceeding, (ii) preparing reports to
stockholders and Government Authorities or (iii) such other purposes for which
access to such documents is determined by Purchaser to be reasonably
necessary, including preparing and delivering any accounting or other
statement provided for under this Agreement or otherwise, preparing Tax
Returns, pursuing Tax refunds or responding to or disputing any Tax audit, or
the determination of any matter relating to the rights and obligations of
Seller or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates under this Agreement. Seller
shall maintain and preserve all such Tax Returns, books, records and other
documents for any applicable statutory or regulatory retention period, as the
same may be extended and, in each case, shall offer to transfer such records
to Purchaser at the end of any such period. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Seller shall not be required to provide any access or
information to Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives which Seller reasonably believes it is prohibited from
providing to Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives by
reason of applicable Law, which constitutes or allows access to information
protected by attorney-client privilege, or which Seller is required to keep
confidential or prevent access to by reason of any Contract with a third party
or which would otherwise expose Seller or any of its Affiliates to a material
risk of Liability. For purposes of this Section 5.09, Purchaser's
Representatives shall include the Financing Sources. 

5.10 Data Room. Within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing, Seller shall

Company, any Subsidiary, any of its other Affiliates or any of its or their
respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit,
initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information
to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into
any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an
Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, and shall cause the Company, any Subsidiary, any of its other
Affiliates, and all of its and their Representatives to immediately cease and
cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person concerning (a) a merger,
consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange or other business
combination transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary; (b) the
issuance or acquisition of equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary;
or (c) the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any significant
portion of the Company's or any Subsidiary's properties or assets.

(5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause New Roads to
distribute up, transfer or otherwise assign to the Company and the Company to
distribute up, transfer or otherwise assign to Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller (other than a Company Entity) the Oxbow Property (the result of such
distributions, transfers or assignments, the "Oxbow Property Transfer")
pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser.

5.13 Audited Financials. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the
Seller shall prepare, and shall engage KPMG to conduct an SAS 100 review of
combined financial statements for the Business as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017, including balance sheets and the related statements of
income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows,
which financial statements shall be delivered to Purchaser on or before April
30, 2018. Up to $100,000 of the out-of-pocket costs of preparation of such
financial statements may be paid for the Company Entities and any such
payments (not to exceed $100,000) shall not constitute Leakage.

5.14 Financing Cooperation. During the Interim Period, Seller shall use, and
shall cause the Company Entities and its and their respective Representatives
(including, as applicable, legal, tax, regulatory and accounting) to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate as reasonably requested by
Purchaser in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (provided
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company Entities). Purchaser shall reimburse Seller
for any reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket third party expenses actually
incurred by it in connection with fulfilling its obligations under this
Section 5.14. In no event shall Purchaser or any of its Affiliates have any
obligation to bring any Action or Proceeding against any Financing Source with
respect to the Debt Financing or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and Seller hereby agrees that it shall not
undertake any action (and shall not cause or permit any of its Affiliates to
undertake any action) that seeks to cause Buyer to bring any such Action or
Proceeding against any Financing Source.

5.15 Equity Settlement of Certain Accounts. No later than February 28, 2018,

within five (5) Business Days of receipt thereof from PJM. Any payment under

account as the Purchaser shall designate in writing to Seller. For the
avoidance of doubt, any PJM 2018/2019 Capacity Revenue or other PJM net
capacity revenue for prior delivery years related to the BC II Unit I Project

herewith shall be solely subject to applicable rules relating to discovery and
the remainder of this Section 6.03 shall not apply.

6.04 Support Obligations. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller and certain
Affiliates have provided certain credit support pursuant to the support
obligations and related agreements described on Schedule 3.23 (the "Support
Obligations"). During the Interim Period, in each case, at Purchaser's sole
risk, cost and expense:

(a) Purchaser shall take all steps reasonably necessary, including offering
substitute guarantees of Purchaser Parent, and Seller shall cooperate (it
being understood that such cooperation shall not include any requirement to
pay any consideration or offer or grant any financial accommodation) in all
reasonable respects with Purchaser, to endeavor to ensure that, effective as
of the Closing Date, (i) Seller and its Affiliates (other than any Company
Entity) shall be released from one hundred percent (100%) of any and all
obligations or Liabilities relating to or arising under or out of or in
connection with each Support Obligation, and (ii) substitute arrangements, if
required by a beneficiary of any Support Obligation, of Purchaser or Purchaser
Parent shall be in effect, including by providing (or causing to be provided)
letters of credit or similar support, and

(b) without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the requirements set
forth in clause (a) of this Section 6.04 are not met as of the Closing Date,
and subject to acceptance by Seller in its reasonable discretion, Purchaser or
its relevant Affiliates shall, in lieu of providing substitute arrangements in
respect of Support Obligations pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of this Section
6.04, enter into such indemnification and reimbursement agreements with Seller
or any of its Affiliates as reasonably necessary to provide Seller and such
Affiliates with an effective release or full indemnification with respect to
all obligations and Liabilities of Seller and such Affiliates to be released
pursuant to in clause (b) of this Section 6.04; provided that, Purchaser's
indemnification obligations under clause (i) shall not affect Seller's
indemnification obligations under Section 11.01. 

6.05 Purchaser Parent Guaranty. Purchaser shall concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, cause to be executed and delivered
to Seller the Purchaser Parent Guaranty.

6.06 Post-Closing Access; Preservation of Records. From and after the Closing,
Purchaser and Purchaser Parent shall make or cause to be made available to
Seller all books, records, Tax Returns and documents of the Company Entities
(and the assistance of employees responsible for such books, records and
documents) during regular business hours as may be reasonably necessary for
(i) investigating, settling, preparing for the defense or prosecution of,
defending or prosecuting any Action, (ii) preparing reports to stockholders
and Government Authorities or (iii) such other purposes for which access to
such documents is determined by Seller to be reasonably necessary, including
preparing and delivering any accounting or other statement provided for under
this Agreement or otherwise, preparing Tax Returns, pursuing Tax refunds or
responding to or disputing any Tax audit, or the determination of any matter
relating to the rights and obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates
under this Agreement; provided, however, that access to such books, records,
documents and employees shall not interfere with the normal operations of
Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Company Entities and the reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses of Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Company Entities incurred
in connection therewith shall be paid by Seller. Purchaser shall cause each
Company Entity to maintain and preserve all such Tax Returns, books, records
and other documents for any applicable statutory or regulatory retention
period, as the same may be extended and, in each case, shall offer to transfer
such records to Seller at the end of any such period. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be required to provide any access
or information to Seller, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives which Purchaser reasonably believes they or the Company
Entities are prohibited from providing to Seller, its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives by reason of applicable Law, which constitutes or
allows access to information protected by attorney-client privilege, or which
Purchaser or the Company Entities are required to keep confidential or prevent
access to by reason of any Contract with a third party or which would
otherwise expose Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company
Entities) to a material risk of Liability. 

6.07 Offers of Employment and Terminations.

(a) At least sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause any applicable relevant Affiliates or designated third-party
operators to, make offers of employment to each Business Employee listed on
Schedule 6.07(a), which offers shall comply with the requirements set forth in
this Section 6.07. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser currently intends
to offer employment to each Business Employee who performs operational
services to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in Louisiana.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required pursuant to the
terms of a Collective Bargaining Agreement or other applicable Law, the
Purchaser does not intend to offer employment to any Business Employee who, as
of the Closing Date, is on short- or long-term disability or workers
compensation, unless and until such Business Employee on short-term disability
is able (in the judgment of the Purchaser) to return to active employment for
the Company or Subsidiary within three (3) months following the Closing Date
and Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all Liabilities in respect of such
Business Employees unless and until such Business Employee becomes employed by
the Company or any Subsidiary within such three (3) month period. Each such
offer of employment shall be for a position having a comparable title and
comparable duties as provided to the applicable offered Business Employee as
of immediately prior to Closing. The Business Employees who accept the terms
and conditions of such offers and who become employed by Purchaser, any of its
relevant Affiliates or any designated third-party operators are hereinafter
referred to as the "Continuing Employees." Seller shall release each
Continuing Employee from any confidentiality agreement or other restrictive
covenant agreement solely as it applies to Purchaser and solely with respect
to matters relating to the Business, any of the Company Entities or the sale
of the Projects that may interfere with such Continuing Employee's prospective
employment with Purchaser, such Affiliate or such designated third-party
operator.

(b) With respect to all Continuing Employees who are covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement as of the Closing ("Transferred Union Employees"),
Purchaser shall, or shall cause any applicable relevant Affiliates or
designated third-party operators employing such Transferred Union Employees
to, assume the terms and conditions of the applicable Collective Bargaining
Agreement.

(c) With respect to all Continuing Employees who are not covered by a
Collective Bargaining Agreement as of the Closing ("Transferred Non-Union
Employees"), Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all pay and benefits
and other costs, expenses, Liabilities, claims, wages, accrued vacation, sick
or paid time off, severance, separation, Taxes, unemployment, and all other
obligations and Liabilities of any nature whatsoever relating to the period on
and after the Lockbox Start Date with respect to the Transferred Non-Union
Employees, except for 2017 AIP Incentive Bonuses.

(d) Seller shall remain liable for all pay and benefits and other costs,
expenses, Liabilities, claims, wages, Taxes and all other obligations and
Liabilities of any nature whatsoever (including any Liabilities under any
Company Employee Plan) relating to (i) the period prior to the Lockbox Start
Date with respect to the Business Employees that become Continuing Employees
relating in any way to their employment with Seller and (ii) relating to all
periods before or after the Lockbox Start Date with respect to Business
Employees who do not become Continuing Employees relating in any way to their
employment with Seller (collectively, "Seller Employment Liabilities");
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller Employment Liabilities shall
include 2017 AIP Incentive Bonuses.

(e) Purchaser shall ensure that each Transferred Non-Union Employee shall (i)
be paid, for at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, an annual
rate of salary or an hourly wage that is not less than what is being paid to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) (A) as of the
Closing, be immediately eligible to participate in Employee Plans of
Purchaser, its relevant Affiliates or designated third-party operator (other
than equity compensation plans) that are substantially similar, in the
aggregate, to those Employee Plans (other than equity compensation plans)
covering similarly situated 

employees of Purchaser, its relevant Affiliates or designated third-party
operator and (B) if applicable, receive a bonus opportunity for at least
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date that is not less than what such
Continuing Employee is eligible for immediately prior to the Closing, and
(iii) as of the Closing, be credited by Purchaser, its Affiliates or
designated third-party operator for all accrued vacation.

(f) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees that for each Continuing
Employee (i) Purchaser's, its relevant Affiliates' and their designated third-
party operator's Employee Plans, which are analogous to the Company Employee
Plans, shall recognize all previous service recognized by such Company
Employee Plans for the purpose of determining eligibility for and entitlement
to benefits (except where doing so would result in a duplication of benefits),
including vesting, and such Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive
benefits under, and participate in, such analogous Employee Plans to the same
extent as similarly situated employees of Purchaser, its relevant Affiliates
or designated third-party operator; and (ii) Purchaser will cause its, or its
relevant Affiliate's or designated third-party operator's, group health plan
to recognize all documented and verifiable deductibles and coinsurance
payments accrued by the Continuing Employees prior to the Closing Date (for
the plan year in which Closing occurs) (or, in the alternative, at Purchaser's
discretion, Seller shall provide to each Continuing Employee a cash payment in
lieu of such recognition of deductible and coinsurance payments) and to waive
any preexisting condition limitations, actively at work exclusions and waiting
periods for the Continuing Employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) no
Transferred Union Employee who is not participating as of the date hereof in a
defined benefit plan of Seller and no Transferred Non-Union Employee shall be
eligible for, entitled to or accrue any benefits under any defined benefit
plan of Purchaser, its Affiliates or designated third party operators, and (2)
Transferred Union Employees who are participating in a defined benefit plan of
Seller as of the date hereof shall be eligible to participate in a cash
balance defined benefit plan established or maintained by Purchaser, its
Affiliates or designated third party operators and such Transferred Non-Union
Employees shall receive credit for prior service with Seller and its
Affiliates for purposes of determining pay credits under any such cash balance
defined benefit plan of Purchaser, its Affiliates or designated third party
operators in accordance with the terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining
Agreement in effect at the time.

(g) Following the Closing Date, to the extent any Company Employee Plan is
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, Purchaser shall take the necessary
action to cause Purchaser's, its relevant Affiliate's or designated third-
party operator's defined contribution plan or plans to accept a trustee-to-
trustee transfer of account balances of the Continuing Employees from such
Company Employee Plan, including outstanding plan loans of Continuing
Employees from any Company Employee Plan, which is a qualified defined
contribution plan, in which Continuing Employees are participating immediately
prior to Closing Date.

(h) With respect to any "mass layoff" or "plant closing" as defined by the
WARN Act or similar applicable state or local Law affecting any of the
Business Employees or other individuals performing work or services related to
or for the Business or the Company Entities, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates or third party operators, as applicable, to: (i) comply fully with
the WARN Act and any and all similar applicable state and local Laws, (ii)
perform and discharge the obligation, if any, to serve in a timely manner and
fashion all notices required by the WARN Act or similar applicable state or
local Law to Business Employees ("WARN Notices") or other individuals
performing work or services related to or for the Business or the Company
Entities who may be legally classified as employees of Seller or any Affiliate
of Seller or third party operator, as applicable, and (iii) cooperate with
Purchaser in providing WARN Notices following the date hereof to the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser.

(i) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or shall, (i) establish, amend
or modify any employee benefit plan (including any Employee Plan), (ii) affect
the rights of Seller, Purchaser, or any of their respective Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit plan (including any Employee
Plan) pursuant to the terms of such plan or any applicable Collective
Bargaining Agreement, (iii) confer upon 

any Business Employee any right to employment or continued employment for any
period of time, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment,
(iv) limit the right of Seller, Purchaser, or any of their respective
Affiliates, as applicable, to change or eliminate any term or condition of
employment or the compensation or benefits available to any Business Employee,
or to terminate the employment of any such employee, or (v) without limiting
anything in Section 6.07, confer any third-party beneficiary or other rights
on any Person, including any Business Employee, other than the parties to this
Agreement.

TAX MATTERS

9.01 Certain Taxes.

(a) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar obligations
of the Company and the Subsidiaries imposed by any Governmental Authority that
are due or become due for Tax periods within which the Closing Date occurs
shall be apportioned between the pre-Closing Date period, on the one hand, and
the post-Closing Date period, on the other hand, as of the Closing Date, based
upon the actual number of days of the Tax period that have elapsed before and
including, and after, the Closing Date, and all income Taxes and Transfer
Taxes imposed on the Company and the Subsidiaries shall be allocated between
the pre-Closing Date period and the post-Closing Date period as though a
taxable year of the Company and the Subsidiaries have ended on the Closing
Date. Seller shall be responsible for the portion of such Taxes described in
the preceding sentence (the "Apportioned Obligations") attributable to the
pre-Closing Date period. Purchaser shall be responsible for such Apportioned
Obligations attributable to the period beginning on or after the Closing Date.
Each Party shall cooperate in assuring that Apportioned Obligations that are
the responsibility of Seller pursuant to the preceding sentences are paid by
Seller, and that Apportioned Obligations that are the responsibility of
Purchaser pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid by Purchaser. If
any refund, rebate or similar payment is received by the Company, the
Subsidiaries, Seller and/or Purchaser for any Taxes that are Apportioned
Obligations, such refund shall be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser as
aforesaid on the basis of the obligations of the Company and the Subsidiaries
during the applicable Tax period, provided any such Tax refund shall belong to
Purchaser if it was included as an asset in the Final Aggregate Net Working
Capital.

(b) Seller shall timely prepare and file with the appropriate authorities all
Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary
with respect to any Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax
Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior
positions and past practice to the extent consistent with applicable Law.
Seller shall provide Purchaser with a completed draft of such Tax Return if it
relates to income Taxes or other material Taxes for Purchaser\'s review as
soon as reasonably practicable once a draft is available. Seller will consider
in good faith any reasonable changes to such Tax Return timely proposed by
Purchaser and provide Purchaser with a copy of any such revised Tax Return as
soon as reasonably practicable after filing. Seller shall timely remit (or
cause to be timely remitted by the applicable Company Entity) any Taxes shown
as due on any such Tax Return, except to the extent such Taxes do not exceed
the liabilities for such Taxes specifically taken into account in determining
the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital.

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, employees and agents reasonably to cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary,
including maintaining and making available to each other all records that are
necessary for the preparation of any Tax Returns that the Party is required to
file under this Article 9, and in resolving all disputes and audits with
respect to such Returns.

(d) All sales, use, transfer, controlling interest transfer, recording, stock
transfer, real property transfer, value-added and other similar Taxes and fees
("Transfer Taxes"), if any, arising out of or in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
shared equally by Purchaser and Seller. Tax Returns that must be filed in
connection with such Transfer Taxes shall 

be prepared and filed by the Party primarily or customarily responsible under
applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other Party
at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to
be filed.

9.02 Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a) The Purchase Price (including for these purposes the amount of any assumed
liabilities included as a part of the purchase price for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes) shall be allocated among the Company Entity assets in the manner
required by Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) (the
"Allocation"). A draft Allocation shall be prepared by Purchaser for the
review and approval of Seller within sixty (60) days after the date of
Closing. If within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Allocation, Seller
notifies Purchaser in writing that Seller objects to the allocation set forth
in the Allocation, Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days thereafter. In the
event that Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within such
thirty (30) day period, Purchaser and Seller shall, within thirty (30) days
after such thirty (30) day period, submit the disputed items to the Neutral
Auditor for resolution under the procedures set forth in this Section.
Purchaser and Seller shall make available to the Neutral Auditor, in
connection with the foregoing, all relevant work papers relating to the
Allocation calculation. Each Party agrees to promptly execute a reasonable
engagement letter, if requested to do so by the Neutral Auditor. Purchaser and
Seller, and their respective Representatives, shall cooperate fully with the
Neutral Auditor. The Neutral Auditor, acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator, shall resolve such disputed items and determine the values to be
ascribed thereto, and using those values (together with other items not in
dispute) determine the final Allocation as of the Closing Date. The Parties
hereby agree that the Neutral Auditor shall only decide the specific disputed
items, the values ascribed thereto and using those values (together with the
other items included in the draft Allocation) determine the final Allocation,
and the Neutral Auditor's decision with respect to such disputed items and
values must be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the
draft Allocation and the notice of objection, respectively. All fees and
expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor
will be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. The Neutral Auditor shall be
directed to resolve the disputed items and amounts and deliver to Purchaser
and Seller a written determination of the final Allocation (such determination
to be made consistent with this Section, including a worksheet setting forth
all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be
based solely on information provided to the Neutral Auditor by Purchaser and
Seller) within thirty (30) days after being retained (or such longer period as
the Neutral Auditor may reasonably require), which determination will be
final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and their respective Affiliates
and representatives, successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the dispute resolution mechanism contained in this Section
shall be the exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes, if any, regarding the
Allocation and neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Article 11 for Losses resulting or arising from
the Allocation.

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including, but not
limited to, IRS Form 8594) consistent with the Allocation. Neither Purchaser
nor Seller shall take any Tax position inconsistent with such Allocation and
neither Purchaser nor Seller shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the
Allocation by any Taxing authority without first giving the other party prior
written notice; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent
Purchaser or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Taxing authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation, and neither
Purchaser nor Seller shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any taxing authority challenging such
Allocation.

(c) Not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the filing of their
respective IRS Forms 8594 relating to this transaction, each of Purchaser and
Seller shall deliver to the other party a copy of its 

IRS Form 8594. If the Final Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to this
Agreement, the Allocation shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with such
adjustment.

(d) Seller and Purchaser agree that the final Allocation shall be used by
Seller and Purchaser as the basis for reporting asset values and other items
for purposes of all federal, state, and local Tax Returns, and that neither
Seller nor Purchaser or their respective Affiliates will take positions
inconsistent with such allocation in notices to any Governmental Authority, in

11.07 on or prior to the applicable survival expiration date, then the
obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article 11 shall survive with respect to such claim until
such claim is finally resolved. With respect to any claims related to
violations or possible violations of an applicable NERC reliability standard,
no claim under this Agreement may be made unless such Party shall have
delivered, with respect to any such claim for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation made in this Agreement, a written
notice of claim prior to the date occurring six months after the conclusion of
any Regional Entity compliance audit covering a period prior to the Closing
Date. 

11.04 Limitations on Claims.

(a) No Party shall have any obligation to indemnify an Indemnified Party until
the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by such Party that are subject to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.01(a) or Section 11.02(a), as
applicable, equals or exceeds one percent (1%) of the Final Purchase Price
(the "Deductible") in which event the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to
pay in full all such Losses (commencing with the first dollar thereof);
provided, however, that the Deductible shall not apply to Losses resulting
from, arising out of or relating to (w) any breach of the Fundamental
Representations, (x) any breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.15 (Environmental), Section 3.26 (No Debt), or the second
sentence of Section 3.03, (y) any willful breach of any representation or
warranty or (z) fraud.

(b) No Party shall have any obligation to indemnify an Indemnified Party in
connection with any single item or group of related items that result in
Losses that are subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.01(a) or
Section 11.02(a), as applicable, in the aggregate of less than Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000); provided, however, that such threshold shall not apply to
Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any breach of the
Fundamental Representations, (ii) any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.15 (Environmental) or Section 3.26 (No
Debt), (iii) any willful breach of any representation or warranty, or (iv)
fraud.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.04(d), the aggregate liability
of the Indemnifying Parties under this Article 11 resulting from breaches of
representations or warranties herein and in any certificates delivered
pursuant hereto shall be limited to an amount equal to twelve percent (12%) of
the Final Purchase Price (the "Cap"); provided, however, that the Cap shall
not apply to Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any
breach of the Fundamental Representations, (ii) any breach of the covenant set
forth in Section 5.07 or the representation or warranty set forth in Section
3.26 (No Debt), (iii) Losses covered by Sections 11.01(b), 11.01(c) (which is
subject to the Special Item Cap), 11.01(e), 11.01(f), 11.01(g), 11.01(h),
11.01(i), 11.01(j) or 11.01(k), (iv) any willful breach of any representation
or warranty, or (v) fraud.

(d) Separate from the Cap established in Section 11.04(c), the aggregate
liability of the Indemnifying Parties under this Article 11 resulting from
Losses covered by Section 11.01(c) shall be limited to an amount equal to
twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) (the "Special Item Cap"); provided,
however, that Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify a Purchaser
Indemnified Party for any Losses covered by Section 11.01(c) that are incurred
to defend an Action or Proceeding that does not result in a prohibition on the
placement of CCR or non-CCR waste-streams in an impoundment or closure of an
impoundment until the aggregate amount of such Losses equals or exceeds Two
Million Dollars ($2,000,000) ("Special Item Deductible"), in which event the
Seller shall be liable for such Losses only to the extent they are in excess
of the Special Item Deductible; provided, further, that neither the Special
Item Cap nor the Special Item Deductible shall apply to Losses resulting from,
arising out of or relating to (i) any willful breach of any representation or
warranty or (ii) fraud.

(e) For purposes of this Article 11, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

(f) In the event that any Losses are subject to indemnification pursuant to
both (x) Section 11.01(a) in respect of a breach of Section 3.15 and (y)
Section 11.01(c):

(i) if there occurs a prohibition on the placement of CCR or non-CCR waste-
streams in an impoundment or closure of an impoundment, such Losses shall be
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 11.01(c) and the Special Item Cap shall
apply (subject to the second proviso set forth in Section 11.04(d)); and 

(ii) if there does not occur a prohibition on the placement of CCR or non-CCR
waste-streams in an impoundment or closure of an impoundment, such Losses
shall be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 11.01(a) and the Cap shall apply
(subject to the proviso set forth in Section 11.04(c)).

11.05 Procedure for Indemnification of Third Party Claims.

(a) Notice. Whenever any claim by a third party shall arise for
indemnification under this Article 11, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim and, when known, the facts
constituting the basis for such claim and, if known, the notice shall specify
the amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability arising therefrom.
The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party copies of all
material notices and documents (including court papers) received or
transmitted by the Indemnified Party relating to such claim. The failure or
delay of the Indemnified Party to deliver prompt written notice of a claim
shall not affect the indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party was actually materially
disadvantaged by such failure or delay in delivery of notice of such claim.

(b) Settlement of Losses. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of
any claim by a third party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder pursuant
to Section 11.06(d), the Indemnified Party shall not settle, consent to the
entry of a judgment of or compromise such claim without the prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the
Indemnifying Party.

11.06 Rights of Indemnifying Party in the Defense of Third Party Claims.

(a) Right to Assume the Defense. In connection with any claim by a third party
which may give rise to indemnity hereunder, except any third party claim
seeking equitable relief or any claim relating to Taxes (which the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume defense thereof), the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after the date the Indemnifying
Party is notified of such claim by the Indemnified Party to assume the defense
of any such claim, which defense shall be prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party
to a final conclusion or settlement in accordance with the terms hereof.

(b) Procedure. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall (i) select counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such claim and (ii) take
all steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof, at its sole cost and
expense. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any such claim, with its own counsel and at its sole
cost and expense; provided, that, if the claim includes allegations for which
the Indemnifying Party both would and would not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall in
that case jointly assume the defense thereof. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall fully cooperate with each other and their respective
counsel in the defense or settlement of such claim and make available to the
other Party all information reasonably available (unless it would adversely
affect the ability of a Party to assert attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product privilege or similar privilege). The Party in charge of the
defense shall keep the other Party appraised at all times as to the status of
the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto.

(c) Settlement of Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a
settlement of or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or
legal proceeding, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(d) Decline to Assume the Defense. The Indemnified Party may defend against
any such claim, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, in
such manner as it may deem reasonably appropriate, including settling such
claim in accordance with the terms hereof if (i) the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of any such claim resulting therefrom within thirty
(30) days after the date the Indemnifying Party is notified of such claim by
the Indemnified Party or (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably 

concludes that the Indemnifying Party is (a) not diligently defending the
Indemnified Person, (b) not contesting such claim in good faith through
appropriate proceedings or (c) has not taken such action (including the
posting of a bond, deposit or other security) as may be necessary to prevent
any action to foreclose a Lien against or attachment of any asset or property
of the Indemnified Party for payment of such claim.

(e) Defense of Certain Claims. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend against and control any claim subject to indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.01(c), 11.01(d) or 11.01(i), at its sole cost and expense (subject
to, in the case Sections 11.01(c) and 11.01(d), the percentage allocations
with respect to Losses set forth therein), in such manner as it may deem
reasonably appropriate; for the avoidance of doubt, Section 11.05 shall apply
to the defense of any claim pursuant to this Section 11.06(e). The
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the
defense of any such claim, with its own counsel and at its sole cost and
expense. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall fully
cooperate with each other and their respective counsel in the defense or
settlement of such claim and make available to the other Party all information
reasonably available (unless it would adversely affect the ability of a Party
to assert attorney-client privilege, attorney work product privilege or
similar privilege). The Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party
appraised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement
negotiations with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have full control, in
their discretion and without any obligation to consult with Seller or its
Affiliates, of all negotiations with respect to, and the execution of, any
extensions of or amendments to any Contracts with any Cooperative Customer;
provided that, to the extent that any such extension or amendment contains an
affirmative obligation to make a payment to any such Cooperative Customer that
would be subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.01(i), the prior
written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) shall be required. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not enter into
any such extension or amendment with a Cooperative Customer that contains a
waiver of damages of the type claimed in the Actions or Proceedings set forth
on Schedule 11.01(i) in respect of the period from the Closing Date through
the date of such extension or amendment unless such extension or amendment
also contains a waiver of such damages in respect of the period prior to the
Closing Date; provided that the limitation in this sentence shall not apply if
Seller\'s consent is required pursuant to the foregoing sentence and Seller
withholds such consents.

11.07 Direct Claims. In the event that any Indemnified Party has a claim
against any Indemnifying Party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder that
does not involve a claim brought by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim and the facts constituting
the basis for such claim and, if known, the amount or an estimate of the
amount of the liability arising therefrom. The failure or delay of the
Indemnified Party to deliver prompt written notice of a claim shall not affect
the indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party was actually materially disadvantaged by such
failure or delay in delivery of notice of such claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days from
receipt of such claim notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim,
the amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder; however if the Indemnifying Party does notify
the Indemnified Party that it disputes such claim within the required thirty
(30) day period, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective Parties with respect to such claim. If the Parties
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
and signed promptly by both Parties. If such Parties shall not agree within
the aforementioned thirty (30) day period, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to take any action in law or in equity as such Indemnified Party
shall deem necessary to enforce the provisions of this Article 11 against the
Indemnifying Party; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any disputes
relating to the indemnity set forth in Section 11.01(i) shall be submitted
following the expiry of such thirty (30) day period or by such earlier date as
agreed by the parties to the Neutral Auditor for resolution under the
procedures set forth in this Section 11.07. Purchaser and Seller shall make
available to the Neutral Auditor, in connection with the foregoing, all
relevant work papers relating to the Leakage calculation. Each Party agrees to
promptly execute a reasonable engagement letter, if requested to do so by the
Neutral Auditor. Purchaser and Seller, and their respective Representatives, 

shall cooperate fully with the Neutral Auditor. The Neutral Auditor, acting as
an expert and not an arbitrator, shall resolve such disputed items and
determine the values to be ascribed thereto, and using those values (together
with other items not in dispute) determine the final actual aggregate amount
of Leakage. The Parties hereby agree that the Neutral Auditor shall only
decide the specific disputed items, the values ascribed thereto and using
those values determine the final actual aggregate amount of Leakage, and the
Neutral Auditor's decision with respect to such disputed items and values must
be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the
Leakage/Indebtedness Certificate and Purchaser\'s claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.01(i), respectively. All fees and expenses relating to
the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor will be borne equally
by Purchaser and Seller. The Neutral Auditor shall be directed to resolve the
disputed items and amounts and deliver to Purchaser and Seller a written
determination of the final actual aggregate amount of Leakage (such
determination to be made consistent with this Section 11.07, including a
worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination and to be based solely on information provided to the Neutral
Auditor by Purchaser and Seller) within thirty (30) days after being retained
(or such longer period as the Neutral Auditor may reasonably require), which
determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and their
respective Affiliates and representatives, successors and assigns.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the dispute resolution
mechanism contained in this Section 11.07 involving the Neutral Auditor shall
be the exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes, if any, regarding any claim
for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.01(i).

11.08 General.

(a) Absent fraud or willful breach, the indemnities set forth in this Article
11 shall be the exclusive remedies of Purchaser and Seller and their
respective members, officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates due
to misrepresentation, breach of warranty, nonfulfillment or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and the Parties shall
not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or to any further
indemnification rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof,
all of which the Parties hereto hereby waive. The provisions of this Article
11 shall not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action under Section 13.03.

(b) Solely for purposes of calculating Losses for which an indemnity
obligation arises under this Article 11, any express qualification or
limitation set forth in the applicable representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation as to materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" (or
words of similar effect) contained therein shall be disregarded.

(c) Any indemnification payment hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account or accounts as the Indemnified
Party may designate in writing to the Indemnifying Party at least two (2)
Business Days before the date payment of the Taxes to which such payment
relates is due, or, if no Tax is payable, within fifteen days after written
demand is made for such payment.

(d) An Indemnifying Party shall not be subrogated to any right of action
(whether pursuant to contract, arising under applicable Law or otherwise)
which the Indemnified Party may have against any other Person with respect to
any matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.

11.09 Indemnity Treatment. Any amount of indemnification payable pursuant to
the provisions of this Article 11 shall, to the extent reasonable under the
Tax Laws, be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise
directed by a Governmental Authority. 

11.10 Mitigation. The amount which an Indemnifying Party is or may be required
to pay to an Indemnified Party in respect of damages for which indemnification
is provided under this Agreement shall be reduced by any amounts actually
received (including amounts received under insurance policies) by or on behalf
of any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates from third parties and any Tax
benefit to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with
the payment of any such damages (such amounts and benefits are collectively
referred to herein as "Indemnity Reduction Amounts"). If any Company Entity or
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates receives any Indemnity Reduction Amounts
in respect of a claim for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement after the full amount of such claim has been paid by an Indemnifying
Party or after an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment of such claim
and such Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid balance of
such claim, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount
theretofore paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim, less (ii)
the amount of the indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity
Reduction Amounts in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity
payment was made. An insurer or other third party who would otherwise be
obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with
respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof,
have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly
understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be
entitled to any benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence
of the indemnification provisions by virtue of the indemnification provisions
hereof. Each of Seller and Purchaser, as appropriate, shall, or shall cause
each Indemnified Party to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
promptly any claims or rights it may have against all third parties which
would reduce the amount of damages for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement and take all commercially reasonable actions to mitigate
damages. Tax benefits under this Section 11.10 shall be determined assuming
full utilization of any resulting deduction or loss in the Tax period in which
the damage is sustained and using the highest combined marginal Tax rate in
effect for federal and applicable state, local and foreign income Taxes for
such Tax period.

warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which (i) would

notification thereof; provided, however, that if, at the end of such 30 day
period, Purchaser is endeavoring in good faith, and proceeding diligently, to
cure such breach, Purchaser shall have an additional 30 days in which to
effect such cure.

12.02 Effect of Termination. 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 12.01, this
Agreement will forthwith become null and void, and there will be no liability
or obligation on the part of either Seller or Purchaser (or any of their
respective Representatives or Affiliates) in respect of this Agreement, except
that the applicable portions of Article 1, this Section 12.02, and the
entirety of Article 11 and Article 13 will continue to apply following any
termination; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 12.02 shall
release any Party from liability for any breach of this Agreement by such
Party prior to the termination of this Agreement (and any attempted
termination by the breaching Party shall be void).

Subsidiaries, the assets of the Company, the assets of the Subsidiaries or
Seller shall remain subject to the provisions of Section 13.06 and the

13.02 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referenced herein
supersede all prior discussions and agreements, whether oral or written,
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and contains
the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

13.03 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that if any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur and money damages may
not be a sufficient remedy. In the event of any breach or threatened breach by
the other Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the
non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without the necessity of posting bonds or
similar undertakings in connection therewith, this being in addition to any
other remedy which may be available to such non-breaching party at law or in
equity, including monetary damages.

13.04 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence with regard to all duties
and time periods set forth in this Agreement.

13.05 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each
Party will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement. The parties
acknowledge and agree that any filing fees required by FERC or in respect of
the HSR Act shall be shared equally by the Parties.

13.06 Public Announcements. None of the Parties nor any of their Affiliates
shall make any written or other public disclosure, announcement or other
similar statement regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as
required by Law, any regulatory authority or under the applicable rules and
regulations of a stock exchange or market on which the securities of the
disclosing Party or any of its affiliates are listed provided, further, that
the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures of information made by or on
behalf of (i) Seller and/or its Affiliates or successors, or (ii) Purchaser
and/or its Affiliates or successors, in each case, to their respective direct
and indirect Affiliates, equity holders, partners, members, financing sources,
counsel, accountants, consultants and other advisors (so long as, in each
case, such disclosure has a valid business purpose and is effected in a manner
consistent with customary practices (including with respect to
confidentiality)). If any disclosure, announcement or similar statement is
required by Law, regulatory authority or rules and regulations of a stock
exchange or market, the disclosing Party shall give the non-disclosing Party
prior notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment promptly on, the
proposed disclosure and shall limit such disclosure to such information as
reasonably required to comply with such applicable Law, regulatory authority
Order or stock exchange or market rules and regulations. 

13.07 Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by
or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition and delivered
pursuant to Section 13.01. No waiver by any Party of any term or condition of
this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or
construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition of this
Agreement on any future occasion. All remedies, either under this Agreement or
by Law or otherwise afforded, will be cumulative and not alternative. The
waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
obligation, or the waiver of the fulfillment of any such condition, shall not
affect the right to indemnification or other remedy based on such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, this sentence of this Section 13.07, Section
13.08, Section 13.09, Section 13.13, Section 13.14 and Section 13.19 may not
be waived in a manner materially adverse to the Financing Sources without the
prior written consent of the Financing Sources, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

13.08 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only
by a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each Party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Section 13.07,
this sentence of this Section 13.08, Section 13.07, Section 13.09, Section
13.13, Section 13.14 and Section 13.19 may not be amended, supplemented,
modified or terminated in a manner materially adverse to the Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

13.09 No Third Party Beneficiary. The terms and provisions of this Agreement
are intended solely for the benefit of each Party and their respective
successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the Parties to
confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other Person other than any
Person entitled to indemnity under Article 11, and the terms and provisions of
this Agreement do not confer such beneficiary rights upon any other Person;
provided that the Financing Sources shall be intended third party
beneficiaries of Section 13.07, Section 13.08, this Section 13.09, Section
13.13, Section 13.14 and Section 13.19 and shall be entitled to enforce such
provisions directly.

13.10 Assignment. The obligations of the Parties under this Agreement are not
assignable without the prior written consent of the other Party, which such
Party may withhold in its discretion; provided that, Purchaser may assign this
Agreement, including the right to purchase the Acquired Interests, without the
prior written consent of Seller, to (a) any Affiliate of Purchaser, or (b) any
Financing Source providing financing to Purchaser from time to time as
collateral security for such financing, in each case so long as Purchaser
remains fully liable for its obligations under this Agreement.

13.11 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the rights or
obligations of any Party under this Agreement shall not be materially and
adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision shall be fully severable, (b)
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision
or by its severance herefrom.

13.12 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS BY THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS
PRINCIPLES THEREOF EXCEPT FOR SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK
GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW. 

13.13 Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a) For all purposes of this Agreement, and for all purposes of any Action or
Proceeding arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, each Party hereto submits
to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the
federal courts of the United States sitting in New York County, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that any such Action or Proceeding may
be heard and determined in such New York court or, to the extent permitted by
law, in such federal court. Each Party hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such Action or Proceeding may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any right that any Party may otherwise have to bring
any Action or Proceeding relating to this Agreement against the other Party or
its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and subject to the waivers in Section 13.19, each Party agrees that
it will not, and it will not permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives
to, bring or support any Action or Proceeding of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or tort or otherwise, against
the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the definitive documentation of the Debt Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in
any forum other than that courts of the State of New York and the federal
courts of the United States sitting in New York County.

(b) Each Party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so:

(i) any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any Action or Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
related matter in any New York state or federal court located in New York
County, and

(ii) the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action or
Proceeding in any such court.

(c) Each Party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process by registered
mail, return receipt requested, as provided in Section 13.01. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any Party hereto to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.

13.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH PARTY
HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO
ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THAT OTHERWISE
RELATES TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING SOURCES,
THE DEBT FINANCING AND THE DEFINITIVE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE DEBT FINANCING AND
ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY).

13.15 Limitation on Certain Damages. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS
AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, SPECULATIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
(COLLECTIVELY, "CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES") FOR ANY REASON WITH RESPECT TO ANY
MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON STATUTE,
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM THE OTHER PARTY'S
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ANY LOSSES ARISING OUT OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS FOR WHICH
A PARTY IS ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT
CONSTITUTE CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, AN ACTION FOR
THE PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES. 

13.16 Disclosures. Any Party may, at its option, include in the Disclosure
Schedules items that are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding,
and any such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be
deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation that such items are material,
to establish any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of
such terms for purposes of this Agreement. In no event shall the inclusion of
any matter in the Disclosure Schedules be deemed or interpreted to broaden
Seller's or Purchaser's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed an admission by a Party that such item
represents a material exception or fact, event, or circumstance.

13.17 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and applicable Law, the Parties shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations or otherwise to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, including such actions or things as any other Party may
reasonably request in order to cause any of the conditions to such other
Party's obligation to consummate such transactions specified in ARTICLE 7 and
ARTICLE 8 to be fully satisfied. Purchaser and Purchaser Parent shall not
enter into any agreement or complete any transactions that would reasonably be
expected to delay, hinder or prohibit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including causing the failure of the closing conditions
set forth in ARTICLE 7 and ARTICLE 8 to be satisfied. Purchaser acknowledges
that, for purposes of Section 6.01 only, for purposes of using its
"commercially reasonable efforts," Purchaser shall, and shall cause Purchaser
Parent and its and Purchaser Parent's respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and representatives to consult
(subject to Section 6.01(e) and Section 6.01(f) above) and fully cooperate
with and provide reasonable assistance to Seller in (a) obtaining all
necessary Consents or other permission or action by, and giving all necessary
notices to and making all necessary filings with and applications and
submissions to, any Governmental Authority or other Person, (b) defending
against all Actions or Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) lifting any
permanent or preliminary injunction or restraining order or other similar
order issued or entered by any court or Governmental Authority (an
"Injunction") of any type referred to in Section 7.03 and Section 7.09 in
general, provided, that Purchaser shall not be required to seek rehearing of
or appeal any ruling of the LPSC or FERC, and (d) consummating and making
effective the transactions contemplated hereby

13.18 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by any number of
counterparts (including by facsimile, PDF or other electronic transmission),
each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will
constitute one and the same instrument.

13.19 Limitation on Liability; Waiver of Claims. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, Seller (on behalf of itself and any of its
Affiliates and Representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims against any
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
definitive documentation of the Debt Financing or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
or in respect of any oral or written representations made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith or therewith and Seller (on behalf of itself and
any of its Affiliates and Representatives) agrees not to commence any Action
or Proceeding against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement,
the Debt Financing, the definitive documentation of the Debt Financing or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity and agrees to cause
any such Action or Proceeding asserted by Seller (on behalf of itself and any
of its Affiliates and Representatives) or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
definitive documentation of the Debt Financing or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity against any Financing Source to be
dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source shall
have any liability for any claims or damages to Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the definitive documentation of the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby 

or thereby. This Section 13.19 is intended to benefit and may be enforced by
