such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such
consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests; provided, further,
that, to the extent necessary to pay the Merger Consideration, Parent shall
promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such
consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent
upon termination of the Exchange Fund.

  


 

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The
shares of Parent Common Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration,
at Parent's option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a
physical certificate is requested by a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock or is otherwise required under Applicable Law.

  


 

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or similar Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  


 

  

(d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon
the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented
to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.03(f) and any cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section
2.07, in each case to the extent provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

  


 

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, and any such holder
who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration and any
dividends and distributions (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock) with respect thereto, in respect of such shares without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company
Common Stock

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent
constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 2.07, shall be paid to the holder of
any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered
or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 2.03.
Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest,
to the Person in whose name the securities of Parent constituting part of the
Merger Consideration have been registered, (i) promptly after the time of such
surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.07 and the
aggregate amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect
to securities of Parent constituting part of the Merger Consideration with a
record date after the Effective Time that were paid prior to the time of such
surrender or transfer with respect to such securities of Parent, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of all dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to securities of Parent constituting part
of the Merger Consideration with a record date after the Effective Time and
prior to the time of such surrender or transfer and with a payment date
subsequent to the time of such surrender or transfer.

  


 

  

(g) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred solely by a holder of Company Common Stock in connection with the
Merger, and the filing of any related Tax returns and other documentation with
respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole responsibility of such
holder.

  


 

  

Section 2.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of
the Delaware Law (such stockholders, the "Dissenting Stockholders" and such
shares of Company Common Stock, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the Delaware Law (and, at the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware Law), unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
waived, withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the Delaware Law. If any
Dissenting Stockholders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
waived, withdrawn or lost such rights, the Dissenting Shares held by such
Dissenting Stockholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.02, without interest. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the Delaware Law and received by the Company relating to
stockholders' rights of appraisal in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the Delaware Law, and Parent shall have the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to all such demands. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to, settle or offer or agree to settle any such demands. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.03 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which
appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

  


 

  

Section 2.05. Stock Awards. (a) At the Effective Time:

  


 

  

(i) each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under
any Employee Plan (each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not vested or
exercisable, with a per share exercise price less than the Equity Award Cash
Consideration, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the excess, if
any, of (1) the sum of (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration plus (y) the value
equal to the product of the Parent Stock Price multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio (the sum of the amounts in clauses (x) and (y), the "Equity Award Cash
Consideration") over (2) the applicable per share exercise price of such
Company Stock Option multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option;

  


 

  

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock outstanding that is subject to
forfeiture risk under any Employee Plan (collectively, "Company Restricted
Shares") and that, pursuant to its terms as of the date of this Agreement, is
vested or becomes vested as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration;

  


 

  

(iii) (A) each performance share unit and restricted stock unit outstanding
under any Employee Plan (collectively, "Company Stock Units") that, pursuant
to its terms as of the date of this Agreement, is vested or becomes vested as
of the Effective Time, and each performance-

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

based Company Stock Unit held by the individual listed on Section 2.05(iii)(A)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (1) the
Equity Award Cash Consideration multiplied by (2) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such unit; and

  


 

  

(B) each Company Stock Unit that, pursuant to its terms as of the date of this
Agreement, is not vested and will not become vested as of the Effective Time
(other than any performance-based Company Stock Unit held by the individual
listed on Section 2.05(iii)(A) of Company Disclosure Schedule), in the event
that the Merger is consummated, shall convert at the Effective Time into a
cash-settled restricted stock unit with the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock underlying such cash-settled restricted stock unit equal to (1) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Unit
(as determined in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable thereto)
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Equity Award
Cash Consideration divided by the Parent Stock Price; provided, that each such
cash-settled restricted stock unit shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including service-based vesting) as applied to the corresponding
Company Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(b) During the 60-day period commencing on the date of this Agreement, Parent,
in consultation with the Company, shall consider, after taking into account
the terms and conditions of each applicable Company Stock Option, the
appropriate treatment of each Company Stock Option, whether or not vested or
exercisable, with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the
Equity Award Cash Consideration.

  


 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (and/or
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company) shall
pass such resolutions as are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.05.

  


 

  

Section 2.06. Adjustments. Without limiting or affecting any of the provisions
of Section 6.01 or Section 7.01, if, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split), merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision
or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such
event on the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 2.07. Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a holder of
shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a
result of the Merger shall be aggregated and, if a fractional share results
from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu
thereof, an amount in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying the
Parent Stock Price by the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

  


 

  

Section 2.08. Withholding Rights. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of any Applicable Law, including federal,
state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. Parent
shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to
the appropriate Taxing Authority within the period required under Applicable
Law.

  


 

  

Section 2.09. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

  


 

  

Section 2.10. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Merger Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or Merger Subsidiary, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.

the date of this Agreement, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC
Document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act prior to the date of this Agreement
did not, and each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act
subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  


 

  

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date
such registration statement or amendment or supplement became effective, did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  


 

  

(e) The Company is and since January 1, 2010, has been in compliance in all
material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being
prepared. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in the Company's
periodic and current reports required under the 1934 Act. For purposes of this
Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer"
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under
the 1934 Act) ("internal controls"). Such internal controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's
financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have disclosed, based on
their most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company (x) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in internal controls. The Company has made available to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete summary of any
disclosure of the type described in the preceding sentence made by management
to the Company's auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2010.

  


 

  

(h) Since January 1, 2010, each of the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has
made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act
and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained
in any such certifications are true and complete.

  


 

  

Section 4.08. Financial Statements and Financial Matters.

respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as may

Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to
normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments in the case of any unaudited
interim financial statements).

  


 

  

(b) From January 1, 2010 to the date of this Agreement, the Company has not
received written notice from the SEC or any other Governmental Authority
indicating that any of its accounting policies or practices are or may be the
subject of any review, inquiry, investigation or challenge by the SEC or any
other Governmental Authority.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 4.09. Disclosure Documents. (a) At the time the proxy or information
statement of the Company to be filed with the SEC in connection with the
Merger (the "Company Proxy Statement") or any amendment or supplement thereto
is first mailed to stockholders of the Company, at the time such stockholders
vote on approval and adoption of this Agreement and at the Effective Time, the
Company Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The representations
and warranties contained in this Section 4.09(a) will not apply to statements
or omissions included in the Company Proxy Statement based upon information
furnished to the Company by Parent expressly for inclusion therein.

  


 

  

(b) None of the information furnished by the Company to Parent expressly for
inclusion in the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto, at the time the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto becomes effective and at the Effective Time, will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  


 

  

Section 4.10. Statutory Financial Statements. (a) Since January 1, 2010, each
Regulated Subsidiary of the Company has filed all annual statements and
quarterly statements required to be filed by it with any Governmental
Authority (the "Company Statutory Filings"). The Company Statutory Filings and
the respective statements of assets, liabilities, surplus and other funds,
reserves and expenses and cash flows included or incorporated by reference
therein (i) were prepared from the books and records of the applicable
Regulated Subsidiary, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
statutory financial condition and results of operations of the applicable
Regulated Subsidiary as of the date and for the periods then ended (subject to
normal and recurring year- end adjustments in the case of any interim
statements) and (iii) were prepared in all material respects in conformity
with applicable statutory accounting principles ("SAP") applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto).

  


 

  

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of
internal controls over statutory financial reporting ("statutory internal
controls"). Such statutory internal controls are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's financial
reporting and the preparation of the Company's statutory financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with SAP.

  


 

  

Section 4.11. Reserves. The loss reserves and other actuarial amounts of the
Regulated Subsidiaries of the Company as of December 31, 2011 recorded in
their respective Company Statutory Filings: (i) were determined in all
material respects in accordance with ASOPs in effect on that date (except as
may be

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

  

 

  

indicated in the notes thereto), (ii) were computed on the basis of
methodologies consistent in all material respects with those used in computing
the corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and (iii) include provisions for all actuarial
reserves that are required to be established in accordance with Applicable
Laws; provided, however, that, without diminishing or affecting the foregoing,
it is acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Subsidiary that the Company
and its Representatives are not making any representation or warranty in this
Agreement and nothing contained in this Agreement, including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, or any other agreement, document or instrument to be
delivered in connection with this Agreement is intended or shall be construed
to be a representation or warranty of the Company or any of its
Representatives in respect of the adequacy or sufficiency of the reserves of
the Company or the Company's Regulated Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

Section 4.12. Capital or Surplus Maintenance. As of the date of this
Agreement, no Regulated Subsidiary of the Company is subject to any
requirement to maintain capital or surplus amounts or levels or is subject to
any restriction on the payment of dividends or other distributions on its
shares of capital stock, except for any such requirements or restrictions
under Applicable Laws, including insurance laws and regulations, of general
application.

  


 

  

Section 4.13. Absence of Certain Changes. Since the Company Balance Sheet
Date, the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and there has
not been any event, change, effect, development or occurrence that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Since the Company Balance Sheet Date,
there has not been any action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time without Parent's consent, would constitute a breach of Section
6.01.

  


 

  

Section 4.14. No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. There are no liabilities or
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever,
whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise,
and there is no existing condition, situation or set of circumstances, that
could reasonably be expected to result in such a liability or obligation,
other than (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the
Company Balance Sheet or in the notes thereto, (ii) liabilities or obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices
since the Company Balance Sheet Date and (iii) other liabilities or

respective capacities as such or any of the respective properties of any of
the foregoing Persons, before (or, in the case of threatened actions, suits,
investigations or proceedings, that would be before) any arbitrator or

delay the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, nor is

expected to result in the termination, cancellation, revocation, adverse
modification or non-renewal of any Company Permit, other than, in the case of

misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
rights of any Third Party or (ii) based upon, or challenging or seeking to

are no outstanding obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Parent Subsidiary Securities.

  


 

  

Section 5.07. SEC Filings. (a) Parent has timely filed with or furnished to
the SEC all reports, schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses, registration
statements and other documents required to be filed with or furnished to the
SEC by Parent since January 1, 2010.

  


 

  

(b) As of its filing date, each report, schedule, form, statement, prospectus,
registration statement and other document filed with or furnished to the SEC
by Parent since January 1, 2010 (collectively, together with any exhibits and
schedules thereto and other information incorporated therein, the "Parent SEC
Documents") filed prior to the date of this Agreement complied, and each
Parent SEC Document filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement will
comply, as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the NYSE, the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the
case may be.

  


 

  

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement, on the date of such filing), each Parent SEC
Document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act prior to the date of this Agreement
did not, and each Parent SEC Document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act
subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  


 

  

(d) Each Parent SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date
such registration statement or amendment or supplement became effective, did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

of the NYSE.

  


 

  

(f) Parent and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to Parent's principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being prepared.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
Parent's principal executive officer and principal financial officer to
material information required to be included in Parent's periodic and current
reports required under the 1934 Act.

  


 

  

(g) Parent and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of
internal controls. Such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of Parent's financial reporting and the
preparation of Parent's financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Parent's principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of
internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parent's auditors
and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent (x) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal controls. Parent has made
available to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement any disclosure of
the type described in the preceding sentence made by management to Parent's
auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2010.

  


 

  

(h) Since January 1, 2010, each of the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of Parent (or each former principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of Parent, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained
in any such certifications are true and complete.

  


 

  

Section 5.08. Financial Statements. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Parent
included or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Documents fairly
present in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
of the dates thereof and

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments in the case
of any unaudited interim financial statements).

  


 

  

Section 5.09. Disclosure Documents. (a) At the time the registration statement
of Parent to be filed with the SEC with respect to the offering of Parent
Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the "Registration Statement ") or
any amendment or supplement thereto becomes effective and at the Effective
Time, the Registration Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.09(a) will not
apply to statements or omissions included in the Registration Statement based
upon information furnished to Parent by the Company expressly for inclusion
therein.

  


 

  

(b) None of the information furnished by Parent to the Company expressly for
inclusion in the Company Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto, at the time the Company Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is first mailed to stockholders of the Company, at the time
such stockholders vote on approval and adoption of this Agreement and at the
Effective Time, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  


 

  

Section 5.10. Reserves. The loss reserves and other actuarial amounts of the
Regulated Subsidiaries of Parent as of December 31, 2011 recorded in their
respective annual statements required to be filed with any Governmental
Authority: (i) were determined in all material respects in accordance with
ASOPs in effect on that date (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), (ii) were computed on the basis of methodologies consistent in all
material respects with those used in computing the corresponding reserves in
the prior fiscal years (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
(iii) include provisions for all actuarial reserves that are required to be
established in accordance with Applicable Laws; provided, however, that,
without diminishing or affecting the foregoing, it is acknowledged and agreed
by the Company that Parent and its Representatives are not making any
representation or warranty in this Agreement and nothing contained in this
Agreement, including the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or any other agreement,
document or instrument to be delivered in connection with this Agreement is
intended or shall be construed to be a representation or warranty of Parent or
any of its Representatives in respect of the adequacy or sufficiency of the
reserves of Parent or Parent's Regulated Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

Section 5.11. Absence of Certain Changes. Since the Parent Balance Sheet Date,
the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in the

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, and there has not
been any event, change, effect, development or occurrence that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  


 

  

Section 5.12. No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. There are no liabilities or
obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever,
whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise,
and there is no existing condition, situation or set of circumstances that

other than (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the
Parent Balance Sheet or in the notes thereto, (ii) liabilities or obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices
since the Parent Balance Sheet Date and (iii) other liabilities or obligations
that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  


 

  

Section 5.13. Litigation. There is no claim, action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against or
affecting, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any present or former officers,
directors or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in their
respective capacities as such or any of the respective properties of any of
the foregoing before (or, in the case of threatened actions, suits,
investigations or proceedings, that would be before) any arbitrator or any
Governmental Authority, that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or that
in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially
delay the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, nor is
there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority outstanding against Parent, any of its Subsidiaries,
any present or former officers, directors or employees of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in their respective capacities as such or any of the respective
properties of any of the foregoing Persons that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.

  


 

  

Section 5.14. Permits. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents (including consents required by Contract),
approvals, variances, exemptions and orders necessary for the operation of the
businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries (the "Parent Permits"). Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries is and since January 1, 2010, has been in compliance
with the terms of the Parent Permits, except for failures to comply that have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Since January 1, 2010, no
event has occurred that (i) gives to any Third Party any right of termination,
cancellation, revocation or adverse modification (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) of any

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Parent Permit or (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, would otherwise reasonably
be expected to result in the termination, cancellation, revocation, adverse

1, 2010, has been no claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding
(including an audit or examination) pending or, to, the knowledge of Parent,
threatened against or affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries alleging any
failure to comply with Applicable Law, except for failures to comply that have
not been and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the

Section 5.16. Opinion Of Financial Advisor. The Board of Directors of Parent
has received separate opinions of each of Goldman Sachs and Co. and UBS

upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth
therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid by Parent pursuant to this
Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent.

  


 

  

Section 5.17. Finders' Fees. Except for Goldman Sachs and Co. and UBS Securities
LLC, whose fees will be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker, broker,
finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act
on behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any fee or commission from the
Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 5.18. Financing. (a) Parent has delivered to the Company a complete
and correct copy of a fully executed commitment letter from the financial
institution(s) named therein (including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes
to such letters as and to the extent delivered to the Company on or prior to
the date of this Agreement, the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which
such financial institutions (including any financial institutions providing
Alternative Financing or Replacement Debt Financing, the "Financing Sources")
have committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, to provide the debt financing described therein in connection with
the Transactions. The Debt Commitment Letter and any other debt commitment
letter (including any replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter in connection
with any Alternative Financing or Replacement Debt Financing) executed in
accordance with Section 7.06, as replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or
waived in

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

accordance with Section 7.06, including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes
to such letters, are hereinafter referred to together as the "Debt Commitment
Letters." The financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters
is hereinafter referred to as the "Debt Financing."

  


 

  

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters are in full
force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, and
to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms against Parent, and to the knowledge of
Parent, each of the other parties thereto. All commitment fees required to be
paid under the Debt Commitment Letters have been paid in full or will be duly
paid in full as and when due, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary have otherwise
satisfied all of the other items and conditions required to be satisfied by
them pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters on or prior to the
date of this Agreement. None of the Debt Commitment Letters have been amended,
modified or terminated on or prior to the date of this Agreement, no such
amendment, modification or termination is contemplated as of the date of this
Agreement and no Debt Commitment Letter will be amended or modified except as
consistent with Section 7.06. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default by Parent or Merger Subsidiary under any Debt
Commitment Letter. Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary is, as of the date of
this Agreement, aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of
the assumptions or statements set forth in any Debt Commitment Letter
inaccurate (assuming the accuracy of the Company's representations and
warranties), in any material respect or that would cause the commitments
provided in the Debt Commitment Letter to be terminated or ineffective or any
of the conditions contained therein not to be met. The consummation of the
Debt Financing is subject to no conditions precedent other than those
expressly set forth in the copies of the Debt Commitment Letters delivered to
the Company, and there are no contingencies that would permit the Financing
Sources to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing other than those
expressly set forth in the copies of the Debt Commitment Letters delivered to
the Company. Except for fee letters relating to fees with respect to the Debt
Financing (redacted copies of which, removing only fee amounts, market "flex"
provisions and certain other terms (none of which concern or would adversely
affect the amounts, availability, timing or conditionality of the Debt
Financing), have been provided to the Company), there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the funding of the Debt
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters
delivered to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date
of this Agreement, assuming no breach by the Company of its representations
and warranties under this Agreement (and cooperation and assistance by the
Company as provided in this Agreement) and no breach or default by the Company
of its obligations under this Agreement in either case such that the condition
set forth in Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.02(b)

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

would fail to be satisfied, and based upon facts and events known by Parent as
of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub have any reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be
satisfied or the Debt Financing will not be consummated as contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date. The aggregate
proceeds of the Debt Financing, together with cash or cash equivalents held by
Parent and the other sources of funds referenced in the copies of the Debt
Commitment Letters delivered to the Company, as of the Effective Time, will be
sufficient to enable them to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by
them in cash in connection with the Transactions, including the Merger
Consideration (and the treatment of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Shares and Company Stock Units pursuant to Section 2.05(a)) and all payments,
fees and expenses payable by them related to or arising out of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 5.19. No Ownership of Company Common Stock. To the knowledge of
Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly
or indirectly, any shares of Company Common Stock and neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any rights to acquire any shares of Company Common
Stock except pursuant to this Agreement. There are no voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity interest
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

that it has no further comments on the Company Proxy Statement or that the

Stockholder Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a
quorum or (iii) once for a period not to exceed thirty calendar days to
solicit additional proxies for the approval and adoption of this Agreement;

originally scheduled time.

  


 

  

(b) Subject to Section 6.03(b), Section 6.03(c), Section 6.03(d) and Section
6.03(e), the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) include in the Proxy

Section 6.03. No Solicitation; Other Offers. (a) From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to Section 6.03(b), Section
6.03(c) and Section 6.03(e), the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
and its Subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, consultants and other agents, advisors, intermediaries
and representatives (collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate
(it being understood and agreed that ministerial acts that are not otherwise
prohibited by this Section 6.03 (such as answering unsolicited phone calls)
shall not be deemed to "facilitate" for purposes of this Section 6.03(a)) or
knowingly encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
assist, participate in, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any effort
by any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) the
Company Board Recommendation (it being understood that failure to issue a
press release that reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation within five
Business Days of the date any Acquisition Proposal or any material
modification thereto is publicly disclosed shall be considered an adverse
modification), (B) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Company Proxy Statement or (C) recommend, adopt or approve or publicly propose
to recommend, adopt or approve an Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing
in this clause (iii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (iv) approve any
transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under,
Section 203 of the Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on the Company
set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section by the Company (it
being understood and agreed that any such violation shall be determined as if
such Representative is bound by the terms of this Section 6.03(a)).

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders (and in no event
after the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders), the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives may (x) contact any Third Party that has made
after the date of this Agreement an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal in order to ascertain facts or clarify terms for the sole purpose of
the Board of Directors of the Company informing itself about such Acquisition
Proposal and such Third Party and (y) subject to compliance with this Section
6.03(b), Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(e), (i) engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Third Party that, subject to the Company's compliance
with Section 6.03(a), has made after

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

the date of this Agreement a Superior Proposal or an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal,
(ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives and
financing sources nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (which confidentiality
agreement shall not include any provision requiring exclusive negotiations
with such Third Party) with confidentiality terms no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which
shall be provided, promptly after its execution, to Parent for informational
purposes; provided that all such non-public information (to the extent that
such information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent)
is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, promptly (but no
later than one Business Day) after or substantially concurrently with the time
it is provided or made available to such Third Party) and (iii) following
receipt of a Superior Proposal after the date of this Agreement, (1) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (2) terminate this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal (provided
that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (2), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (2)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently
with such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 10.03(d)), but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iii) only if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall
prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (x) complying with Rule 14e
-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, so long as
any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this
Section 6.03, provided that (subject to the following sentence) any such
action taken or statement made that involves or relates to an Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation
in such statement or in connection with such action; or (y) making any
required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law, provided that any
Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal
may only be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.03(b), Section
6.03(c) and Section 6.03(e) . For the avoidance of doubt, a "stop, look and
listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act shall not be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 6.03(b), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 6.03(b) unless the Company shall have
first delivered to Parent written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action, and the Company shall continue to advise Parent, on a
current basis, after taking such action of the status and material terms of
any discussions and negotiations with the applicable Third Party. In addition,
the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours)
after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a Third Party is considering making
an Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, which
notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall identify the Third
Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request (including any material changes thereto). The
Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of the status
and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including
any changes thereto) and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all material correspondence and
written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as
written summaries of any material oral communications addressing such
matters).

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders (and in no event after the approval and adoption of this
Agreement by the Company's stockholders), the Board of Directors of the
Company may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to
an Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided that (x) the Company shall
(A) promptly notify Parent in writing of its intention to take such action and
(B) negotiate in good faith with Parent for two Business Days following such
notice regarding revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
and (y) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not effect any Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to an Intervening Event unless,
after the two Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (B), the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law.

  


 

  

(e) Without limiting or affecting Section 6.03(a), Section 6.03(b) or Section
6.03(c), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make an

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Superior Proposal or
terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company promptly notifies
Parent, in writing at least five calendar days before taking such action, that
it intends to take such action, which notice attaches the most current version
of any proposed agreement or a detailed summary of all material terms of such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the offeror, (ii) if requested by
Parent, during such five calendar day period, the Company and its
Representatives have discussed and negotiated in good faith with Parent
regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement in
response to such Superior Proposal and (iii) after such five calendar day
period, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, taking
into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement, that
such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that in the event of any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of any such Superior Proposal, a new
written notification from the Company consistent with that described in clause
(i) of this Section 6.03(e) shall be required and a new notice period under
clause (i) of this Section 6.03(e) shall commence, during which notice period
the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section
6.03(e) anew, except that such new notice period shall be for three Business
Days (as opposed to five calendar days)). After delivery of such written
notice pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall
promptly keep Parent informed of all material developments affecting the
material terms of any such Superior Proposal (and the Company shall provide
Parent with copies of any additional written materials received that relate to
such Superior Proposal).

  


 

  

(f) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal (with all references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal being deemed to be references to "50%") on terms that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all the
terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors
of the Company considers to be appropriate (including the expected timing and
likelihood of consummation, any governmental or other approval requirements,
break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation
and availability of necessary financing), would result in a transaction (i)
that if consummated, is more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view (taking into account, among other items, the tax
attributes of such transaction) than the Merger (taking into account any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement), (ii) that is
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into
account the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, any
approval requirements and all other financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) for which financing, if a cash
transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed in a manner
comparable to Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's financing

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(or which is reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors
of the Company).

  


 

  

(g) "Intervening Event" means any material event, change, effect, development
or occurrence occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement that (i)
was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors or executive
officers of the Company as of or prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii)
does not relate to or involve an Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

(h) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' respective
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Party (or
its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information about the
Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy
all such information. During the term of this Agreement, except in connection
with the termination of this Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal in
accordance with Section 6.03(b), the Company shall not take any actions to
exempt any Person other than Parent and Merger Subsidiary from any
antitakeover provision in the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, or make any state takeover statute (including any Delaware
state takeover statute) or similar statute inapplicable to any Acquisition
Proposal.

  


 

  

(i) Notwithstanding (i) any Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the making of
any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not publicly) or (iii) anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, until termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms (x) in no event may the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A)
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar instrument constituting or relating to
an Acquisition Proposal, (B) except as required by Applicable Law, make,
facilitate or provide information in connection with any SEC or other
regulatory filings in connection with the transactions contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal or

  

(C) seek any third-party consents in connection with the transactions
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal and (y) the Company shall otherwise
remain subject to all of its obligations under this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 6.04. Access to Information; Confidentiality. From the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and subject to
Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i)
give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to its offices,
properties, books, Contracts and records, (ii) furnish as promptly as
reasonably practicable to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors
and other authorized

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

representatives such financial and operating data and other information as
such Persons may reasonably request, in each case unless furnishing such
information would constitute a violation of Applicable Law or of any
confidentiality obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
contracts; provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the beneficiaries of any such
confidentiality obligations to provide any consent necessary to permit the
Company and its Subsidiaries to furnish such information, and (iii) instruct
its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent in its investigation;
provided, however, that (1) the Company shall not be required to afford such
access if it would unreasonably disrupt its operations or those of any of its
Subsidiaries or would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any Applicable Law
and (2) Parent shall not have access to individual performance or evaluation
records, medical histories or other information that in the reasonable opinion
of the Company is sensitive or the disclosure of which could reasonably be
expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of
liability or information that is subject to attorney-client privilege or other
privilege. All such access shall be subject to reasonable restrictions imposed
from time to time with respect to the provision of privileged communications
or any applicable confidentiality agreement with any Person. Any investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be conducted in such manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or
damage any property or any portion thereof. All information furnished pursuant
to this Section shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated as of
April 26, 2012, between Parent and the Company (the " Confidentiality
Agreement"). No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company pursuant to this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 6.05. Tax Matters. (a) From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (i) make or change any Tax election;
(ii) change any annual Tax accounting period; (iii) adopt or change any method
of tax accounting; (iv) enter into any closing agreement with respect to
Taxes; (v) consent to any extension or waiver of the limitations period
applicable to any Tax claim or assessment (other than (A) with respect to the
claims and assessments set forth in Section 6.05 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, any extension or waiver of the limitations period for a period not
to exceed six months and (B) with respect to other claims and assessments, any
extension or waiver of the limitations period for a period not to exceed 12
months); (vi) file any amended Tax Returns or claims for Tax refunds; (vii)
settle or surrender any material Tax claim, audit or assessment (A) with
respect to the claims, audits, or assessments set forth in Section 6.05 of the

65  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

excess of amounts reserved, and (B) with respect to any other claims, audits,
or assessments, for an amount in excess of $1,000,000, individually; or (viii)
surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, or offset or other reduction in Tax
liability, in each case, in lieu of a Tax refund, if the amount of the Tax
refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability so surrendered exceeds
$1,000,000; except (x) with respect to each of clauses (i) through (viii), as
may be required by Applicable Law or as set forth in Section 6.05 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or (y) with respect to each of clauses (i) through
(vi), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an adverse effect on the Company that is material.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section
6.05 contains the sole and exclusive covenants in this Agreement of the
Company regarding Tax matters.

  


 

  

Section 6.06. Financing Assistance. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at the sole expense of Parent, use its
and their commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of any
financing to be consummated in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) . Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing sentence, prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, at the sole expense of Parent, use its and their
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable
providing information (financial or otherwise) relating to Company to the
Persons providing the financing (including information to be used in the
preparation of an information package regarding the business, operations,
financial projections and prospects of Parent and the Company customary or
reasonably necessary for the completion of such financing) to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent to assist in preparation of customary offering
or information documents to be used for the completion of the financing, (ii)
cooperate with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources,
including participating in reasonable number of meetings, due diligence
sessions and road shows, at times and at locations reasonably acceptable to

statements (including pro forma financial statements, all of which unaudited
financial statements shall have been reviewed by the Company's independent
accountants as provided in Statement on Accounting Standards No. 100), private
placement memoranda, prospectuses and other similar documents, including
delivery of (A) audited consolidated balance sheets and related audited
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company
for each of the three fiscal years most recently ended at least 90 days prior
to the Closing Date (and audit reports for such financial statements shall not
be subject to any "going concern" qualifications) and (B) unaudited
consolidated balance sheets and related

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

unaudited statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the
Company for each subsequent fiscal quarter ended at least 60 days prior to the
Closing Date, (iv) make available, on a customary and reasonable basis and
upon reasonable notice, appropriate personnel, documents and information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case, as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, (v) obtain any necessary consents from
auditors in connection with any filings with the SEC; provided that until the
Closing occurs, the Company shall (A) have no liability or any obligation
under any agreement or document related to the financing or (B) not be
required to incur any other liability in connection with the financing unless
simultaneously reimbursed or reasonably satisfactorily indemnified by Parent,
(vi) obtain customary legal opinions, financing accountants' comfort letters
and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating
to the financing and in connection with any filings required to be made by
Parent pursuant to the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act (including the Registration

the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of
the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.06 (without
duplication of any reimbursement pursuant to the preceding sentence). Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses (including attorneys' fees), interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred in connection with any financing or other
securities offering of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries or any assistance or
activities provided in connection therewith.

  


 

  

Section 6.07. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of any stockholder litigation (including derivative
claims) against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement,
the Merger and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
keep Parent fully informed regarding any such stockholder litigation. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation and
shall give due consideration to Parent's advice with respect to such
stockholder litigation. Further, the Company shall not settle any litigation
commenced on or after the date of this Agreement against it or any of its
directors or executive officers by any stockholder of the Company relating to
this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or
otherwise, without the

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed)

  


 

  

Section 6.08. Transition. (a) In order to facilitate the integration and the
operations of the Company and Parent and their respective Subsidiaries and to
permit the coordination of their related operations on a timely basis after
the Effective Time, and in an effort to accelerate to the earliest time
possible after the Effective Time the realization of synergies, operating
efficiencies and other benefits expected to be realized as a result of the
Merger, the Company, upon Parent's request, shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use its and their commercially reasonable efforts to consult
with Parent on all strategic and operational matters, including with respect
to the renewal or extension of any lease or sublease of real property expiring
in 2013 for more than a one year renewal or extension term (and shall not
enter into any such renewal or extension prior to consulting with Parent), to
the extent such consultation is not in violation of Applicable Law. In
furtherance of the foregoing, upon Parent's request, the parties shall
establish a transition planning team of at least six members (the "Transition
Team") comprised of an equal number of representatives of Parent and the
Company, which shall be responsible for facilitating a transition and
integration planning process to ensure the successful combination of the
operations of Parent and the Company. Upon Parent's request, subject to
Applicable Law, the Transition Team shall be responsible for developing and
implementing a detailed action plan for the combination of the businesses from
and after the Effective Time and shall (i) confer on a regular and continued
basis regarding the status of the transition and integration planning process,
(ii) communicate and consult with its members with respect to (x) the manner
in which the respective businesses will be conducted from and after the
Effective Time and (y) the manner in which the Company's accounting,
investment, hedging, underwriting and claims administration policies and
practices will be conformed to those of Parent from and after the Effective
Time and (iii) coordinate human resources integration. Upon Parent's request,
the Company shall devote sufficient resources to the Transition Team and share
information as necessary to achieve the objectives set forth in this Section
6.08, including making available its facilities and those of its Subsidiaries,
in order to assist the Transition Team, to the extent not in violation of
Applicable Law.

  


 

  

(b) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, (i) at the
reasonable request of Parent, the Company shall cooperate in good faith with
Parent to establish and implement Company-sponsored employee retention and
transition incentive programs designed to encourage the retention and
performance of employees and groups of employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who are mutually identified by the Company and Parent and (ii)
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, coordinate with Parent
with respect to the formulation and dissemination of all internal and external
communications and announcements relating to the impact on employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries of the Merger and the integration of the
operations

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of the Company with those of Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the adoption of a retention and transition incentive
program described above pursuant to the mutual written agreement of the
Company and Parent, and the obligations and liabilities relating to such
agreed program, shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the
completeness, truthfulness and accuracy of the representations of the Company
set forth in Article 4 and for purposes of determining the Company's
compliance with its covenants under Section 6.01.

  


 

  

Section 6.09. Indentures. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
timely provide or cause to be provided, in accordance with the provisions of
the indentures relating to the Company's 6.125% Senior Notes due 2015, 5.950%
Senior Notes due 2017, 6.300% Senior Notes due 2014 and 5.450% Senior Notes
due 2021 (the ("Indentures"), to the trustee under each Indenture, any
notices, announcements, certificates or legal opinions required by such
Indenture to be provided in connection with the Merger prior to the Effective
Time. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any such notice, announcement, certificate or legal opinion, in
each case before such document is provided to such trustee, and the Company
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent and its counsel.

  


 

  


 

  

ARTICLE 7

  

COVENANTS OF PARENT

  


 

  

Parent agrees that:

  


 

  

Section 7.01. Conduct of Parent. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, except (x) as
prohibited or required by Applicable Law, (y) as set forth in Section 7.01 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule or (z) as otherwise required or expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, unless the Company shall otherwise consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, conduct its
business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws and all Parent
Permits and use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its
business organization and relationships with customers, suppliers, licensors,
licensees, distributors and other third parties and keep available the
services of its present officers and employees; provided, however, that no
action or failure to take action by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters specifically addressed by any provision of Section 7.01(a)
through (c) shall constitute a breach under this paragraph unless such action
or failure to take action would constitute a breach of such provision of
Section 7.01(a) through (c), as applicable. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, from the
date of

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

  

 

  

this Agreement until the earlier of termination of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, except with the Company's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not:

  


 

  

(a) adopt or propose any change in Parent's certificate of incorporation or
bylaws in a manner materially adverse to the Company's stockholders (whether
by merger, consolidation or otherwise);

  


 

  

(b) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution, payable in
cash, stock or property, with respect to any of its capital stock, other than
regular cash dividends in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice; or

  

  

(c) adopt a plan of complete or partial liquidation or dissolution of Parent.

  


 

  

Section 7.02. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 7.03. Director and Officer Liability. (a) From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law (including to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the Delaware
Law adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which
a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors), indemnify, defend and
hold harmless (and promptly advance expenses from time to time as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, provided, the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides a reasonable and customary undertaking (which
shall not include posting of any collateral) to repay such advances, if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification) the
present and former directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each an " Indemnified Person") from and against any and all
costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
regulatory or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with
any circumstances, developments or matters in existence, or acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time in their
capacities as officers, directors and employees of the Company, including the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or arising out of or pertaining to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the provisions in
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to the extent they provide for
indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to facts or circumstances
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, on the same basis as set forth in
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company in effect on the
date of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time
under Applicable Law, which provisions shall not be amended except as required
by Applicable Law or except to make changes permitted by Applicable Law that
would enlarge the scope of the Indemnified Parties' indemnification rights
thereunder.

  


 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, purchase a six year extended reporting period endorsement with respect
to the Company's currently existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, which endorsement shall contain
coverage that is at least as protective to the Persons covered by such
existing insurance, and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
endorsement in full force and effect for its full term, provided that in no
event shall the aggregate cost of such endorsement exceed 300% of the current
annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance (the "Maximum Amount");
provided, further that if the aggregate cost of such endorsement exceeds the
Maximum Amount, the Company shall purchase, and the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain, as much comparable insurance as is available for the Maximum
Amount. Such endorsement shall be placed through such broker(s) and with such
insurance carriers as may be specified by Parent and as are reasonably
acceptable to the Company.

  


 

  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or the surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.03.

  


 

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
the Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under
all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries). These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. The
obligations of Parent under this Section 7.03 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person unless
the

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

affected Indemnified Person shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification. It is expressly agreed that each Indemnified
Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 7.03, and entitled
to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 7.03. If any Indemnified
Person makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under
this Section 7.03 that is denied by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation,
and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Person
is entitled to such indemnification, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall pay such Indemnified Person's costs and expenses, including legal fees
and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.03 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  


 

  

Section 7.04. Employee Matters. (a) Subject to Section 7.04(c), following the
Effective Time, Parent will or, as applicable, will cause its Subsidiaries to,
honor all obligations under all Employee Plans that exist on the date of this
Agreement (or as established or amended in accordance with or permitted by
this Agreement) that apply to any current or former employee, or current or
former director, of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Through the end of the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (the "Benefits Continuation
Period"), the Surviving Corporation shall provide, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to the individuals who are employed by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and to
the extent they continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of
Parent's Subsidiaries during all or a portion of the Benefits Continuation
Period (the " Affected Employees") compensation (including base salary, bonus
and other incentive compensation opportunities) and employee benefits no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and employee benefits
provided to the Affected Employees under the Employee Plans immediately prior
to the Effective Time. For two years following the Effective Time, individuals
who are employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be provided with severance benefits in amounts and on
terms and conditions that are no less favorable than those provided to such
individuals immediately prior to the Effective Time, as set forth in the
Company's Severance Pay Plan, effective as of January 1, 2012.

  


 

  

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Affected Employee
first becomes eligible to participate, on or after the Effective Time (the
"New Company Plans "), Parent shall: (a) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

  

  

requirements applicable to such Affected Employee under any health and welfare
New Company Plans in which such Affected Employee may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, (b) recognize service of Affected
Employees (or otherwise credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries) accrued
prior to the Effective Time for all purposes under (but not for the purposes
of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) any New Employee
Plan in which such Affected Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, provided, however, that in no event shall any credit be given
to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the same
period of service and (c) if applicable, cause to be credited any deductibles
or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by employees of the Company and their
beneficiaries and dependents during the portion of the calendar year prior to
their participation in Parent's health plans with the objective that there be
no double counting during the year in which the Effective Time occurs of such
deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses.

  


 

  

(c) (i) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to
continue to employ any Affected Employee for any period of time following the
Effective Time, (ii) nothing herein shall prevent Parent or its Affiliates
from revising, amending or terminating any Employee Plan or any other employee
benefit plan, program or policy in effect from time to time, (iii) nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed as an amendment of any Employee Plan, and
(iv) no provision of this Section 7.04 shall create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any director, officer, employee or individual
independent contractor (including former directors, officers, employees or
individual independent contracts) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including any beneficiary or dependent of such individual).

  


 

  

Section 7.05. Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Merger to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

Section 7.06. Financing. (a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters,
including using commercially reasonable efforts (i) to negotiate and enter
into the definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (including, as necessary,
the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee letter) by a date no later
than the date that is three months from the date hereof and (ii) to satisfy
(or if determined advisable by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, obtain the waiver
of) on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing within
Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's control and to comply with all of its
obligations pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters and the definitive
agreements related thereto. In the event that all conditions to funding the
commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letters have been satisfied,

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

  

each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related
fees and expenses on the Closing Date (including, to the extent commercially
reasonable, by taking enforcement action to cause the Financing Sources to
provide the Debt Financing). Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce all of its rights under the
Debt Commitment Letters. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give the Company
prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letters or the definitive agreements related thereto of which Parent or Merger
Subsidiary has become aware or any termination of any of the Commitment
Letters or such definitive agreements. In the event that any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall (1) use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, alternative debt financing for any
such portion from alternative debt sources (" Alternative Financing") in an
amount that will still enable Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. If obtained, Parent
shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements (other
than any fee letters and engagement letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with Alternative Financing. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
not, without the Company's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related thereto unless the terms of such Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements related thereto, in each case as so amended, modified or
waived, are substantially similar to those in such Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive agreement related thereto, prior to giving effect to such
amendment, modification or waiver (other than economic terms, which shall as
good as or better for Parent and Merger Subsidiary than those in the Debt
Commitment Letter or definitive agreement relating thereto prior to giving
effect to such amendment, modification or waiver); provided that in the case
of amendments or modifications of any Debt Commitment Letter or a definitive
agreement relating thereto, the foregoing shall only apply if such amendment
or modification (x) could reasonably be expected to (I) adversely affect the
ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Subsidiary timely consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (II) make the timely funding of
the Debt Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing less likely to occur, (y) reduces the amount of the Debt Financing
or (z) adversely affects the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to enforce
their rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or the
definitive agreements relating thereto. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
provide the Company with prompt written notice of the receipt of any notice or
other communication from any financing source with respect to such financing

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

source's failure or anticipated failure to fund its commitments under any Debt
Commitment Letters or definitive agreement in connection therewith. Parent and
Merger Subsidiary shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent, in
its sole discretion, may replace any existing Debt Commitment Letter with a
debt commitment letter (a "Replacement Debt Commitment Letter") pursuant to
which financial institutions selected by it in its sole discretion commit to
provide debt financing to finance the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ("Replacement Debt Financing") and on or following the effectiveness
thereof Parent may, in its sole discretion terminate the existing Debt
Commitment Letter and the commitments thereunder; provided that, without the
Company's consent, the terms of such Replacement Debt Financing shall be
substantially similar to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive
agreement relating thereto being replaced (other than economic terms, which
shall be as good as or better for Parent and Merger Subsidiary than those in
the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreement relating thereto being
replaced). Promptly following the execution of a Replacement Debt Commitment
Letter by Parent, Parent shall notify the Company to such effect and shall
promptly provide a fully executed copy of such Replacement Debt Commitment
Letter and any related agreements (other than any fee letters or engagement
letters). Such notice shall also satisfy the Parent's notification
requirements under Section 7.06(b) relating to termination of the existing
Debt Commitment Letter.

  


 

  


 

  

ARTICLE 8

  

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

  


 

  

The parties hereto agree that:

  


 

  

Section 8.01. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to consummate the Merger, (x) including (i) preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental Authority or other
Third Party all documentation to effect all necessary Filings, (ii) obtaining
and maintaining all licenses, authorizations, permits, consents, approvals,
clearances, variances, exemptions, orders and other confirmations required to
be obtained from any Governmental Authority or other Third Party that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and (iii) cooperating
to the extent reasonable with the other parties hereto in their efforts to
comply with their obligations under this Agreement and (y) which may include
contesting (which may include by litigation) any (i) action, suit,
investigation or proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority in a
federal, state or administrative court seeking to

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

enjoin, restrain, prevent, prohibit or make illegal consummation of the Merger
or seeking damages or to impose any terms or conditions in connection with the
Merger or (ii) Order that has been entered by a federal, state or
administrative court that enjoins, restrains, prevents, prohibits or makes
illegal consummation of the Merger or imposes any damages, terms or conditions
in connection with the Merger. Subject to clause (y) of the preceding
sentence, the parties understand and agree that Parent's obligation to use its
reasonable best efforts set forth in this Section 8.01(a) includes taking all
actions and doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable
Law (including divestitures and the entry into other commitments and
limitations) to obtain the governmental approvals described in clauses (x),
(y) and (z) of the first sentence of Section 8.01(b) to consummate the Merger
so long as such actions would not have and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect
on Parent or on the Company.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.01(a) or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement will obligate or require Parent or Merger
Subsidiary to take or cause to be taken any action (or refrain or cause to
refrain from taking any action) or agree or cause to agree to any term,
condition or limitation as a condition to, or in connection with, (x) the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period relating to the
Merger under the HSR Act, (y) any other Applicable Law that is designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or (z) obtaining any Required
Governmental Authorization, in each case if such action (or refraining from
such action), term, condition or limitation would have or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Regulatory Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or on the Company. "Regulatory Material Adverse
Effect" means, with respect to any Person, any event, change, effect,
development or occurrence, in each case resulting from or arising out of the
matters contemplated by clauses (x) through (z) of the first sentence of this
Section 8.01(b), that has a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, business, revenue or EBITDA of such Person and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; provided that, for purposes of determining whether any
action, term or condition would have or would reasonably be expected to have a
Regulatory Material Adverse Effect on Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries will
collectively be deemed to be a company the size of (and with revenue and
EBITDA equal to those of) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
provided, further, that, for purposes of determining whether any action, term
or condition would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Regulatory
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or on the Company, (i) impacts on the
synergies expected to be realized from the Merger that are publicly disclosed
by Parent will be taken into account and (ii) impacts on Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be aggregated. "EBITDA" means,
with respect to any Person, the sum of (1) consolidated net income, determined
in accordance with GAAP, plus (2) without duplication and to the extent
deducted in determining such

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

consolidated net income, the sum of (I) consolidated interest expense, (II)
consolidated income tax expense and (III) all amounts attributed to
depreciation or amortization, in each case of such Person and its Subsidiaries
.

  


 

  

(c) Neither the Company nor Parent shall, and each of them shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly (whether by merger, consolidation
or otherwise), acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire,
purchase, lease or license) any business, corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division or part thereof, or any
securities or collection of assets, if doing so would reasonably be expected
to: (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase
the risk of not obtaining, any Consent, or exemption of any Governmental
Authority necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; or (iii) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise.

  


 

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 8.01(a), the parties shall
as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, make all
Filings with all Governmental Authorities that may be or may become reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and Applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including: (i) not later than 30 Business Days following
the date of this Agreement, Parent filing, or causing to be filed, "Form A
Statements" or similar change of control applications, with the insurance
commissioners or departments of health or other Governmental Authorities in
each jurisdiction where required by Applicable Law seeking approval of
Parent's acquisition of control of each of the Regulated Subsidiaries which
results from the Merger; (ii) as promptly as practicable, Parent filing, or
causing to be filed, any pre-acquisition notifications on "Form E" or similar
market share notifications to be filed in each jurisdiction where required by
Applicable Laws with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) not later than 10 Business Days following the date
of this Agreement (unless the Parties otherwise agree to another time period),
the Company and Parent each making an appropriate Filing of a notification and
report form pursuant to the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and requesting early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act; (iv) the Company and
Parent each making any other Filing that may be required under any other
Applicable Laws relating to antitrust or by any Governmental Authority having
antitrust jurisdiction under Applicable Law; (v) not later than 60 days prior
to the Closing, the Company and Parent filing any required notices to CMS,
with a separate notice to the CMS Central and/or Regional Office Medicare
Advantage and/or Part D plan manager if applicable; and (vi) the Company and
Parent each promptly making any other Filing that may

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

  

be required under any Applicable Laws or by any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any such Applicable Law.

  


 

  

(e) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall,
as promptly as practicable, (i) upon the reasonable request of the other
party, furnish to such party and upon any reasonable request from a
Governmental Authority, furnish to such Governmental Authority, any
information or documentation concerning themselves, their Affiliates,
directors, officers and securityholders, information or documentation
concerning the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and such
other matters as may be requested and (ii) make available their respective
personnel and advisers to each other and, upon reasonable request, any
Governmental Authority, in connection with (A) the preparation of any Filing
made by or on their behalf to any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (B) any
investigation, review or approval process.

  


 

  

(f) Subject to Applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, each of
the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of any Filing or
material communication or inquiry it or any of its Affiliates intends to make
with or receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that
are the subject of this Agreement, and prior to submitting any Filing,
substantive written communication, correspondence or other information or
response by such party or any or its Representatives, on the one hand, to any
Governmental Authority, or members of the staff of any Governmental Authority,
on the other hand, the submitting party shall permit the other party and its
counsel the opportunity to review as reasonably in advance as practicable
under the circumstances, and consider in good faith the comments of the other
party in connection with any such Filing, communication or inquiry and further
each of the Company and Parent shall furnish each other with a copy of any
Filing, communication or, if in written form, inquiry, it or any of its
Affiliates makes to or receives from any Governmental Authority relating to
matters that are the subject of this Agreement. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Clean Team Confidentiality
Agreement and all other agreements entered into by the parties to this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate fully with
each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing (including
in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act). Each such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto of any
material oral communication with, and provide copies of material written
communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding any Filing. None of
the parties hereto shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
conference with any Governmental Authority, or any member of the staff of any
Governmental Authority, in respect of any Filing, proceeding, investigation
(including any settlement of the investigation), litigation, or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, allows the other party to
participate.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Neither party shall be required to comply with any of the foregoing provisions
of this Section 8.01(f) to the extent that such compliance would be prohibited
by Applicable Law. The parties further covenant and agree not to voluntarily
extend any waiting period associated with any consent or approval of any
Governmental Authority (including under the HSR Act) or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Authority or other Third Party not to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except
with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Parent shall have
responsibility for the filing fees associated with its "Form A Statements" or
similar change of control applications and its "Form E" or similar market
share notifications.

  


 

  

(g) Each of the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 8.01 as "Outside Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside counsel of the recipient and, subject to any additional
confidentiality or joint defense agreement the parties may mutually propose
and enter into, will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 8.01, materials provided to the other party or its outside
counsel may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning valuation, (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

requirements of the 1934 Act and (y) the Registration Statement and any

practicable after each such filing and to have the Registration Statement
remain effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the

thereto) is filed with the SEC, and reasonable and good faith consideration
shall be given to any comments made by such party and its counsel. Each of
Parent and the Company shall provide the other party and its counsel with (x)
any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that such party
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Company Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, as

comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and
good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC.

  


 

  

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Company Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

  

notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the

amendments or supplements to the Company Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement or for additional information and shall supply each other with
copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Company Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the
Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding (x) any Adverse Recommendation Change, (y) the public
proposal or announcement or other submission to the Company or any of its
Representatives of an Acquisition Proposal or (z) anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms, the obligations of the Company under this Section 8.02 shall continue

the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any Section of this Agreement
or that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 8.04 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving that notice.

  


 

  

Section 8.05. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted

perform (A) is incapable of being cured by the End Date or (B) has not been
cured by the Company within 30 days following notice to the Company from

failure to perform (A) is incapable of being cured by the End Date or (B) has
not been cured by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as applicable, within 30 days

not be effective if Parent institutes such appropriate proceedings within such
10-day period).

  


 

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
(other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or Representative of such party) to the other party hereto
(except as provided in Section 10.03); provided that neither Parent nor the
Company shall be released from any liabilities or damages arising out of any
(i) fraud by any party, (ii) the willful and intentional breach by any party
of any representation or warranty on the part of such party set forth in this
Agreement or (iii) the willful and intentional breach of any covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 10.02,

termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.

  


 

  

Section 10.03. Termination Fee. (a) In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Sections 10.01(c)(i) or 10.01(c)(iii), then the Company shall pay
Parent a fee of $167,500,000 (the "Termination Fee") within one Business Day
after the date of such termination.

  


 

  

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(iii) and an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, then
the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee simultaneously with
termination of the Agreement (in the case of a termination by the Company) or
within one Business Day after the termination of the Agreement (in the case of
a termination by Parent).

  


 

  

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(iii) (but no Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred) and
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly proposed, announced or disclosed and not irrevocably withdrawn,
then (A) the Company shall pay Parent 25% of the Termination Fee

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

87  

  

 

 

  

 

  

simultaneously with the termination of this Agreement (in the case of a
termination by the Company) or within one Business Day after the termination
of this Agreement (in the case of a termination by Parent) and (B) if the
Company within 12 months after such termination either consummates an
Acquisition Proposal or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent
(or its designees) the remaining 75% of the Termination Fee simultaneously
with such consummation or entering into such definitive agreement, as the case
may be. For purposes of this Section 10.03(c), each reference to "20%" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%".

  


 

  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(ii), then, in advance of or concurrently with such
termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the

(e) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i),
Section 10.01(b)(ii) (solely in respect of an Order in respect of the matters
contemplated by clauses (x) through (z) of the first sentence of Section
8.01(b)) or Section 10.01(d)(iii) and, at the time of such termination, (A)
the condition set forth in Section 9.02(d) has not been satisfied and (B) the
conditions set forth in Section 9.01 (other than the condition set forth in
Section 9.01(b) solely in respect of an Applicable Law in respect of the
matters contemplated by clauses (x) through (z) of the first sentence of
Section 8.01(b)) and Section 9.02(a) through (c) have been satisfied (or in
the case of conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the
date of such termination), then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
$450,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee") to the Company as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within five Business Days following
such termination); provided that no Reverse Termination Fee shall be payable
by Parent pursuant to this Section 10.03(e) if the failure of the condition
set forth in Section 9.02(d) to be satisfied is caused by the Company's
willful and intentional breach of Section 8.01.

  


 

  

(f) Any payment of the Termination Fee (or applicable portion thereof) or the
Reverse Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent or the Company,
as applicable.

  


 

  

(g) The parties agree and understand that (x) in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion (other than the
allocation of the Termination Fee required by Section 10.03(c)) and in no
event shall Parent and Merger Subsidiary be required to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (y) in no event shall Parent be
entitled, pursuant to this Section 10.03, to receive an amount greater than
the Termination Fee and in no event shall the Company be entitled, pursuant to
this

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

88  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.03, to receive an amount greater than the Reverse Termination Fee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case
of fraud, (i) if Parent receives the Termination Fee from the Company pursuant
to this Section 10.03 or if the Company receives the Reverse Termination Fee
from Parent or Merger Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 10.03, such payment
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the
paying party and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Affiliates and Representatives and none of the paying party, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
if (A) Parent or Merger Subsidiary receives any payments from the Company in
respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives the
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 10.03 or (B) the Company receives any
payments from Parent or Merger Subsidiary in respect of any breach of this
Agreement and thereafter the Company receives the Reverse Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 10.03, the amount of such Termination Fee or Reverse
Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of
such payments made by the party paying the Termination Fee or Reverse
Termination fee, as applicable, in respect of any such breaches. The parties
acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 10.03 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.03 do not constitute a penalty.
Accordingly, if any party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 10.03, such party shall also pay any costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the party entitled
to such payment in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement
that results in a judgment for such amount against the party failing to
promptly pay such amount. Any amount not paid when due pursuant to this
Section 10.03 shall bear interest from the date such amount is due until the
date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition in effect on the date of such payment.

Section 11.02. Survival. The representations, warranties and agreements
contained in this Agreement and in any certificate or other writing delivered
pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time, except for the
agreements set forth in Section 7.03. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties agree that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01 and, in the event
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01, all references
to "the date of this Agreement" or "the date hereof" in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be deemed to be the date of such termination.

  


 

  

Section 11.03. Amendments and Waivers. (a) Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that, after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained there shall be no amendment or waiver
that would require the further approval of the stockholders of the Company
under the Delaware Law without such approval having first been obtained.

  


 

  

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies in
this Agreement provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

  


 

  

Section 11.04. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such cost or expense.

  


 

  

Section 11.05. Disclosure Schedule References and SEC Document References. (a)
The parties hereto agree that each section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, shall be
deemed to qualify the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement,
irrespective of whether or not any particular section or subsection of this
Agreement specifically refers to the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable. The parties hereto further agree that
(other than with respect to any items disclosed in Section 4.18(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, for which an explicit reference in any other
section shall be required in order to apply to such other section) disclosure
of any item, matter or event in any particular section or subsection of either
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed disclosure with

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

91  

  

 

 

 

  

  

respect to any other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, to which the relevance of
such disclosure would be reasonably apparent, notwithstanding the omission of
a cross-reference to such other section or subsections.

  


 

  

(b) The parties hereto agree that in no event shall any disclosure contained
in any part of any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document entitled "Risk
Factors", "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" or "Special
Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" or containing a description or
explanation of "Forward-Looking Statements" or any other disclosures in any
Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document that are cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) any representations and warranties of any party contained in this
Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 11.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of the
parties hereto, except for: (i) only following the Effective Time, the right
of the Company's stockholders and holders of Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Shares and Company Stock Units, as applicable, to receive (w) the
Merger Consideration in respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.02, (x) the consideration payable in respect of Company Stock
Options pursuant to Section 2.05(a), (y) the consideration payable in respect
of Company Restricted Shares pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and (z) the
consideration payable in respect of Company Stock Units pursuant to Section
2.05(a), (ii) the right of the Company on behalf of its stockholders to pursue
damages (including claims for damages based on loss of the economic benefits
of the Merger to the Company's stockholders) in the event of Parent's or
Merger Subsidiary's wrongful termination of this Agreement or breach of this
Agreement (whether or not this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
Section 10.01), which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary and (iii) the right of the Indemnified Persons to
enforce the provisions of Section 7.03 only, and except that any Financing
Source shall be an express third-party beneficiary of Section 11.07, Section
11.08 and Section 11.09. The third-party beneficiary rights referenced in
clause (ii) of the preceding sentence may be exercised only by the Company (on
behalf of its stockholders as their agent) through actions expressly approved
by the Board of Directors of the Company, and no stockholder of the Company
whether purporting to act in its capacity as a stockholder or purporting to
assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the Company, shall
have any right or ability to exercise or cause the exercise of any such right.

  


 

  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time
to time in

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

92  

  

 

 

 

  

  

part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment shall
not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

  


 

  

Section 11.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

  


 

  

Section 11.08. Jurisdiction/Venue. Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, on
behalf of itself or its property, in accordance with Section 11.01 or in such
other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, of copies of such process
to such party, and nothing in this Section 11.08 shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law,
(ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
property in any action or proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, (iii) agrees that it shall not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (iv) agrees that any actions or
proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and determined only in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), (v) waives any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such
court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court
and agrees not to plead or claim the same and (vi) agrees that it shall not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding in such court as provided above shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Applicable Law.

  


 

  

Section 11.09. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

93  

  

 

 

  

 

  

WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.09.

  


 

  

Section 11.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf
attachments, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed and delivered (by electronic communication,
facsimile or otherwise) by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless
each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto,
this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement
or other communication).

  


 

  

Section 11.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement and the letter agreement,
dated as of July 20, 2012, relating to certain confidentiality obligations
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
thereof.

  


 

  

Section 11.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

94

damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that, except where this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 10.01, the parties shall be entitled to

enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts referred to in Section 11.08, without proof of actual damages (and each
party further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy) in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.
