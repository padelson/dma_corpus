ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

  

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares, collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_ "), other than (i) Cancelled Shares (which shall be treated in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_), (ii) Dissenting Shares (which shall be treated in accordance with _Section 2.1(d)_), and (iii) Company Restricted Shares (which shall be treated in accordance with _Section 5.5(a)(ii)_ ), shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $15.00 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") without interest. All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.1_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with _Section 2.2_. 

   

 (b) _Cancelled Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted. Each share of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with this  _Section 2.1(c)_. 

   

 (d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are 

    ##### 

  

 

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not
voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto
in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled
to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of such Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such
Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger
Consideration for such Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_. At the
Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give the
Parents (i) prompt written notice and a copy of any written demands received
by the Company for appraisals of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand
and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such notices, demands or instruments. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of the Parents (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) or as otherwise required by applicable Law, make any
payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or settle any such
demands. 

   

 (e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution is declared with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

   

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. At, or prior to, the time at which the Cable Transfer is consummated, the Parents shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved in advance by the Company and the Parents in writing (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Parents and the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, the Company Stock Options, the Company Restricted Shares, the Company Restricted Stock Units and the Company Stock-Based Awards, cash in U.S. dollars which (together with any funds to be deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)(iii)_) is sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares, any Company Restricted Shares and any Dissenting Shares) payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares 

      ##### 

  

    

represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions
of this  _Article II_, and (ii) the Option and Stock-Based Consideration
payable pursuant to  _Section 5.5_ (such cash referred to in subsections
(a)(i) and (ii) being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions from Metro
Parent, make payments out of the Exchange Fund as provided for in this 
_Article II_, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
If, for any reason, the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to
which holders of Shares shall be entitled under _Section 2.1(a)_ and the
Option and Stock-Based Consideration pursuant to  _Section 5.5_, the Parents
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit
additional cash with the Paying Agent to make all payments of Merger
Consideration and Option and Stock-Based Consideration, and each of the
Parents and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for
payment thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parents shall be responsible
for all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. 

   

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. 

   

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the third (3rd) business day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (A) to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_, (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Parents and the Company may mutually agree) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and (B) to each holder of a Company Stock Option, a Company Restricted Share, a Company Restricted Stock Unit or a Company Stock-Based Award, a check in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to _Section 5.5_ hereof in respect of such Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share, Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Stock-Based Award; _provided_ that, in lieu of the payments contemplated by subsection (B), the Parents and the Surviving Corporation may direct the Paying Agent to reimburse the Surviving Corporation (or its designees) for (but only to the extent of) any amounts actually paid by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation to the holders of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Stock-Based Awards in respect of the consideration payable therefor pursuant to _Section 5.5_. 

  

 (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any 

   ##### 

  

 

cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. 

   

 (iii) Each of the Company, Metro Parent, Cable Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Stock-Based Awards such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted by such person under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or the holder of the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Stock-Based Awards, in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

  

 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Metro Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant to this _Article II_. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares and the former holders of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Stock-Based Awards for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any such holder who has not received the payments contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ or _Section 5.5_, as applicable, shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for such payments, without any interest thereon. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Cable Buyer, Metro Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares or any former holder of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Stock-Based Awards for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by the Parents; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation 

    ##### 

  

 

pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_. The Parents shall promptly replace any funds
deposited with the Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to
this _Section 2.2(f)_. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, Metro Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

 Section 4.5 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) The Parents have delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of (i) the executed equity commitment letter from ABRY Partners VI, L.P. (the " _Sponsor_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, Sponsor has agreed to provide equity financing (the " _Metro Equity Financing_ ") to Metro Parent and/or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Metro Equity Commitment Letter_ "), (ii) the executed equity commitment letter from Sponsor pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, Sponsor has agreed to provide equity financing (the " _Cable Equity Financing_ " and collectively with the Metro Equity Financing, the " _Equity Financing_ ") to Cable Buyer in connection with the Cable Transfer (the " _Cable Equity_  

      ##### 

  

    

 _Commitment Letter_ " and collectively with the Metro Equity Commitment
Letter, the " _Equity Commitment Letters_ "), and (iii) executed debt
commitment letters and related term sheets (the " _Debt Financing
Commitments_ ," as each may be amended or replaced from time to time to the
extent permitted by _Section 5.11(a)-(b)_, and, together with the
Equity Commitment Letters, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from SunTrust
Bank, General Electric Capital Corporation and Societe Generale (the "
_Lenders_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of
which, the Lenders have committed to provide loans in the amounts described
therein, the proceeds of which may be used to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated by Cable Buyer (the " _Cable Debt
Financing_ ") and Metro Parent (the " _Metro Debt Financing_ " and
collectively with the Cable Debt Financing, the " _Debt Financing_ " (and,
together with the Equity Financing pursuant to the Equity Commitment
Letters, the " _Financing_ ")). Each of the Financing Commitments is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, and to the knowledge of the Parents as of the date hereof, the
other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, each of the Financing
Commitments is in full force and effect, and none of the Financing Commitments
has been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified
in any respect, and no such amendment or modification is contemplated.
Neither Cable Buyer, Metro Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the
terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing Commitments, and as
of the date hereof no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default
or failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the
date hereof, neither Cable Buyer, Metro Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to
believe that any of the conditions in the Financing Commitments will not
be satisfied, or that the Financing will not be made available on a timely
basis in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
As of the date hereof, neither Sponsor nor any Lender has notified Cable
Buyer, Metro Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate any of the
Financing Commitments or not to provide the Financing. The net proceeds from
the Financing, together with any cash or cash equivalents held by the Company
(not needed for other purposes) at the Effective Time, will be sufficient to
consummate the Cable Transfer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment by the Parents
and Merger Sub of the Cable Transfer Payment, the Merger Consideration, the
Option and Stock-Based Consideration, any fees and expenses of or payable by
Cable Buyer, Metro Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and any
related repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Parents or Merger Sub have paid in full any and all commitment or other fees
required by the Financing Commitments that are due as of the date hereof, and
will pay, after the date hereof, all such commitments and fees as they become
due. Except for fee letters with respect to fees and related arrangements with
respect to the Financing Commitments, there are no side letters,
understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to the Financing
to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates are a party. There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing or the conditions
precedent thereto, other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the
Financing Commitments or the payment of fees payable pursuant to the fee
letters with respect to the Debt Financing Commitments (collectively, the "
_Disclosed Conditions_ "). No person has any right to impose, and none of
Sponsor, any Lender, Cable Buyer or Metro Parent has any obligation to
accept, any condition precedent to such 

      ##### 

  

    

funding other than the Disclosed Conditions nor any reduction to the aggregate
amount available under the Financing Commitments on the Closing Date (nor any
term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate
amount available under the Financing Commitments on the Closing Date).
Subject to the Companys compliance with this Agreement and the
satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.3_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing, or that the Financing will not be available
on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to
Closing under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Cable Transfer
or the Merger, for Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or Merger Sub to obtain
the Financing or any alternative financing; _provided_ , that in no event
shall Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or Merger Sub be required to consummate the

consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such

accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt
of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto, or any "stop, look and listen" communication by the Special
Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company, shall not constitute a
Change of Recommendation or an approval or recommendation with respect to
any Alternative Proposal.

consummated, would result in any person or group (as defined under Rule 13(d)

twenty-five percent (25%) or greater economic or voting interest in the
Company. 

   

 (l) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide (i) Alternative Proposal (except that references to "twenty-five percent (25%) or more" in the definition thereof will be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%) or more") or (ii) written proposal to acquire assets or businesses of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries for a Purchase Price in excess of $665,000,000, in each case made by any person that is on terms that the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all legal, financial (including the financing terms thereof), regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal, as well as any modification to this Agreement, the Limited Guarantee and/or the Financing Commitments (or the terms of any Alternative Acquisition Agreement offered by the Parents, in the case of clause (ii)) that the Parents and Merger Sub propose to make in accordance with _Section 5.3(e)(ii)_), are more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,

effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including taking
all such further actions that would not reasonably be expected to constitute,
individually or in aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, as may be
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal
Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities
of any other nation or other jurisdiction (each of the foregoing, an "

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, and (B) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that

ability to retain, one or more of their Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as

proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the Closing, and (vi) subject to applicable legal limitations and

respect to such transactions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.6_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this  _Section 5.6_. 

   

 (f) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall, and each shall cause its respective affiliates not to, take any action (including any acquisition of businesses or assets) which would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement due to the actions of any Antitrust Authority, State PUC or the FCC. Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that in the event that any affiliate of Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or the Company takes any such action that it shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or the Company, as appropriate.

 Section 5.7 _Takeover Statute_. The Company and its Board of Directors shall take all action necessary to ensure that no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Parents and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of each person who is now or has been prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other similar organizational documents or in any agreement identified on _Section 5.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall survive the Acquisition Transactions and shall continue in full force and effect. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Metro Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws and similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect to exculpation, limitation of liabilities and indemnification than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any person who is now or has been prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, each of the Parents shall be jointly and severally liable for, and Metro Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section 5.9_ without limit as to time. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, each of the Parents and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now or has been prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to 

      ##### 

  

    

the Effective Time, an Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any Action arising out of, relating to or in connection with
the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or
is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of
another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time. In the event of any such Action, (i) each of the Parents
and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in
the defense of any such Action and (ii) neither of the Parents nor
the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any Action pending or threatened in writing to which an
Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could
be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents. 

   

 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain (and Metro Parent shall cause to be maintained) in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that Metro Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor polices of at least the same coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail" policy); _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time, neither Metro Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase at or prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the premium for any such "tail" policy shall not be in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this  _Section 5.9_ and Metro Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder. 

   

 (d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.9_. 

   

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have, as of the date hereof, under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or similar organizational documents of the 

      ##### 

  

    

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or
otherwise. The provisions of this  _Section 5.9_ shall survive the
consummation of the Acquisition Transactions and expressly are intended to
benefit, and are specifically enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties. 

   

 (f) In the event Metro Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Metro Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.9_. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.9_, in the event Cable Buyer or Cable Opco or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person (other than Sponsor or any of Sponsors affiliates), and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person (other than Sponsor or any of Sponsors affiliates), then, and in either such case, all of Cable Buyers and its Subsidiaries obligations under this _Section 5.9_ shall cease and be of no further effect as of immediately prior to the consummation of such consolidation, merger or transfer. 

   

 Section 5.10 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Metro Equity Financing and the Metro Debt Financing (together, the " _Metro Financing_ ") and the Cable Equity Financing and the Cable Debt Financing (together, the " _Cable Financing_ "), as applicable, on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the applicable Financing Commitments, (ii) maintain in effect the applicable Financing Commitments, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the applicable Financing Commitments on terms and conditions not materially less favorable, in the aggregate and taken as a whole, to Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the applicable Financing Commitments, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub contained in the applicable Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto) within their control, including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Metro Financing and the Cable Financing, as applicable, and (v) upon satisfaction of such conditions, and the conditions set forth in  _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), enforce all of its rights under the applicable Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto) and consummate the applicable Financing at or prior to the 

      ##### 

  

    

Closing Date, but in no event later than the End Date (it being understood
that it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement, nor to the
consummation of the Cable Transfer or the Merger, for Cable Buyer, Metro
Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or any Alternative
Debt Financing; _provided_ , that in no event shall Cable Buyer, Metro Parent
or Merger Sub be required to consummate the Closing any earlier than the
second (2nd) business day immediately following the end of the Marketing
Period). The Parents shall keep the Company informed on a reasonable basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing (including providing the Company with copies of all definitive
agreements and other documents related to the Financing). The Parents shall
give the Company prompt notice upon having knowledge of any breach by any
party of any of the Financing Commitments or any termination of any of the
Financing Commitments. Other than as set forth in _Section 5.11(b)_, neither
Parent shall, without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditional or delayed), amend, modify, supplement or
waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the
Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto) or any
other provision of, or remedies under, the Financing Commitments (or any
definitive agreements related thereto), in each case to the extent such
amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would reasonably be expected to
have the effect of (A) adversely affecting in any material respect the
ability of Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) amending, modifying,
supplementing or waiving the conditions or contingencies to the Financing in
a manner materially adverse to the Company or the holders of Shares or (C)
materially delaying the Effective Time or the Closing. In the event all
conditions applicable to the Financing Commitments have been satisfied and
all of the conditions set forth in  _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions)
have been satisfied (or waived), each of Cable Buyer and Metro Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and Sponsor to fund the
Metro Financing and the Cable Financing, as applicable, required to
consummate the Cable Transfer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including by taking enforcement
action to cause the persons providing the Metro Financing and the Cable
Financing, as applicable, to fund such Financing). 

   

 (b) Each of Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub may, and if all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable (other than due to the failure of a condition to the consummation of the Debt Financing resulting from a breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company set forth in this Agreement, in each case, after providing ten (10) days (or such shorter period of time as may then exist under the Debt Financing) written notice to the Company and a reasonable opportunity to cure), each of Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to, (i) arrange to promptly obtain the Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from alternative sources, which may include one or more of a senior secured debt financing, an offering and sale of notes, or any other financing or offer and sale of other debt securities, or any combination thereof, in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is available, together with any cash or cash equivalents held by the Company (not needed for other purposes) at the Effective Time, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Cable Buyer, Metro Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Alternative Debt Financing_ ") and (ii) obtain a new financing commitment letter (the " _Alternative Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and a new definitive agreement 

      ##### 

  

    

with respect thereto that provides for financing (A) on terms not materially
less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Parents and Merger Sub, (B)
containing conditions to draw and other terms that would reasonably be
expected to affect the availability thereof that (1) are not more
onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions and terms contained in the
Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof and (2) would not reasonably
be expected to materially delay the Effective Time or the Closing and (C) in
an amount that is sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that
is available, together with any cash or cash equivalents held by the Company
as of the Effective Time, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by
Cable Buyer, Metro Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In such
event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed
to include any Alternative Debt Financing (and consequently the term
"Financing" shall include the Equity Financing and the Alternative Debt
Financing), and the term "Debt Financing Commitments" as used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Debt Commitment Letter. 

   

 (c) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will request their respective Representatives to, cooperate reasonably with Cable Buyer, Metro Parent, Merger Sub and their authorized Representatives in connection with the arrangement and closing of the Debt Financing (including any Alternative Debt Financing), including, without limitation, (i) assisting in the preparation for and participating on reasonable advance notice in a reasonable number of lender and investor meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, meetings with rating agencies and similar events, and providing reasonable assistance to the Parents in obtaining any ratings contemplated by the Debt Financing; (ii) furnishing information (including financial statements) reasonably required to be included in, and providing reasonable assistance with, the preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, rating agency presentations and similar documents; _provided_ that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to high yield debt securities need not be issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ _further_ that any such memoranda or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and financial statements with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor or obligors; (iii) without limitation of clause (ii) above, as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnishing the Parents and their Lenders with financial and other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by the Parents (including in connection with the Parents preparation of pro forma financial statements), including annual and interim financial statements, financial data, audit reports and other information of the type required by Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act and Regulation S-K for a registered public offering, and of type and form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A, to consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments, or as otherwise reasonably required in connection with the Debt Financing and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise necessary in order to assist in receiving customary "comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort) from independent accountants in connection with the Debt Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments, including the Segment Financial Statements and the Pro Forma Segment Financial Information (each as defined in  _Section 5.11(d)_) (all such foregoing information in this clause (iii), the " _Required Information_ "), and any other financial statements or other information reasonably requested by the Lenders in connection with the Debt Financing; 

      ##### 

  

    

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary accountants comfort
letters, appraisals and surveys (including providing reasonable access to the
Parents and their respective agents to all owned real property for such
purposes), title insurance and other documentation and items relating to the
Debt Financing as reasonably requested by the Parents and, if requested
by the Parents or Merger Sub, to cooperate with and assist the Parents or
Merger Sub in obtaining such documentation and items; (v) arranging for
consents of accountants for appropriate use of their reports in any materials
relating to the Debt Financing and reasonably facilitating the pledging
or the re-affirmation of the pledge of collateral (including cooperation in

related Liens); (vi) taking commercially reasonable actions necessary to (A)
permit the Lenders to evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries current
assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purposes of establishing collateral
arrangements as of the Effective Time and (B) assist the Parents to establish
or maintain, effective as of the Effective Time, bank and other accounts and
blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with
the Financing; and (vii) taking all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by the Parents that
are necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing,
including any high yield financing, and to permit the proceeds
thereof, together with the cash or cash equivalents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (not needed for other purposes), to be made available to the
Company on the Closing Date to consummate the Cable Transfer and the Merger.
The Company agrees that it will supplement and keep current the
Required Information on a reasonably periodic basis and provide any
supplements reasonably requested by the Parents so that the Parents may
access the financing markets. Any information provided to Cable Buyer, Metro
Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section 5.11(c)_ shall be subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company and its Representatives shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any financing
documents and any materials that are to be presented during any meetings
conducted in connection with the Financing, and the Parents shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its Representatives. Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its affiliates and
their respective Representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or
incur any liability to any person under or in connection with,
the arrangement of the Financing or any alternative financing that Cable
Buyer, Metro Parent or Merger Sub may raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that Cable Buyer, Metro
Parent and Merger Sub shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing or any alternative financing (other than to the extent such
losses arise from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives, as determined by a
final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by the Company or its Subsidiaries expressly for use in
connection therewith). The Company consents, prior to the termination of this
Agreement, to the reasonable use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing in a manner custom ary
for such financing transactions. Nothing in this  _Section 5.11(c)_ shall
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any assistance
which would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

       #####

 Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to the Parents and Merger Sub, and the Parents and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or would reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in _Article VI_ not to be satisfied as of the Closing, and (b) any material failure of the Company, Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, or any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ shall not affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the parties.

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ or  _Section 7.1(h)_ or by the Parents pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_; 

 

then in any such event the Company shall pay to the Parents (or a person
designated in writing by the Parents) by wire transfer of same-day funds a
fee equal to the Termination Fee. " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean an amount
equal to ten million dollars ($10,000,000) if such termination is effected

respect 

      ##### 

  

    

to a Superior Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, and shall mean
an amount equal to seventeen million five hundred thousand dollars

or the consummation of any Qualifying Transaction, or in the case of a
termination referenced in clause (ii) above, concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to  _Section 7.1(g)_
or _Section 7.1(h)_ or within two (2) business days after termination of
this Agreement by the Parents pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_. For the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination
Fee on more than one occasion. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) if this Agreement is terminated (A) by either the Parents or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, or (B) by the Parents pursuant to _Section 7.1(k)_ and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement that would cause the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ or  _Section 6.2_ not to be satisfied, then in such event the Company shall pay to the Parents (or a person designated in writing by the Parents) by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the Parent Expense Amount not later than three (3) business days after such termination. The " _Parent Expense Amount_ " shall mean the actual documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Parents or their respective affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, but not limited to, all reasonable fees and expenses of the Parents counsel, accountants, financial advisors, financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants) up to a maximum of six million dollars ($6,000,000). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Parent Expense Amount on more than one occasion.

 (d) The Parents shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company a termination fee equal to thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ or _Section 7.1(j)_. Any fee 

      ##### 

  

    

due under this _Section 7.2(d)_ shall be paid to the Company or its designee
by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) business days after the

shall the Parents be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement other than solely under the specific circumstances and as specifically set forth in _Section 8.5_. 

   

 (f) If the Company or the Parents, as the case may be, fail to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, and, in order to obtain the payment, the Parents or the Company, as the case may be, commence litigation or arbitration which results in a judgment (or any settlement payment) against the other party for the payment set forth in this _Section 7.2_, such paying party shall pay the other party its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at prime rate of JPMorgan Chase and Co. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus five percent (5%) per annum through the date such payment was actually received. 

   

 (g) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, in the circumstances in which such fees become payable, constitute liquidated damages and are not a penalty. Each of the Termination Fee, the Parent Expense Amount and the Parent Termination Fee provided for in this _Section 7.2_ 

      ##### 

  

    

is payable under the terms provided in this _Section 7.2_ whether or not

Except as otherwise provided in this _Article VII_, any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ (other than _Section 7.1(a)_) shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of notice of the terminating party to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable. In the event of a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any partner, member, stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate, agent or other representative of such party or parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (i) for the terms of _Section 3.21_,  _Section 4.8_, _Section 4.12_, _Section 5.8_, _Article VII_, _Article VIII_ , the Limited Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement (subject, in the case of the Limited Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement, to the terms thereof), and (ii) subject to _Section 7.2_ and  _Section 8.5(c)_, nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable, from liability for any breach of this Agreement. 

   

ARTICLE VIII 

   

MISCELLANEOUS 

  

 Section 8.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Limited Guarantee) shall survive the consummation of the Acquisition Transactions. This _Section 8.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto which by its terms requires performance after the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 8.2 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.2_, whether or not the Acquisition Transactions are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition Transactions, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such expenses; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all fees paid in respect of any HSR or other regulatory filings (including in connection with the FCC Approvals, the State PUC Approvals and the LFA Approvals) shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Parents and fifty percent (50%) by the Company. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_.

   ##### 

  

 

of the parties and delivered (by telecopy, electronic transmission or
otherwise) to the other parties. 

   

 Section 8.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 8.5 _Enforcement; Jurisdiction_  

  

 (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to _Section 7.2_ and _Section 8.5(b)_, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of _Section 7.2_ , in the event of any breach of this Agreement by the Company, each of Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub retain the right to pursue any and all remedies available at law, in equity, in contract or otherwise, including without limitation specific performance and monetary damages. Subject to _Section 8.5(b)_, the foregoing right shall include the right of the Company to cause each of Metro Parent and Merger Sub to seek to enforce the terms of the Metro Equity Financing and the Debt Financing Commitments related to the Metro Debt Financing (and any definitive agreements related thereto) and to cause Cable Buyer to seek to enforce the terms of the Cable Equity Financing and the Debt Financing Commitments related to the Cable Debt Financing (and any definitive agreements related thereto) against the Lenders, Sponsor and any other applicable party to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to such Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto) and applicable Laws and to thereafter cause the Cable Transfer and the Merger to be consummated, in each case, if the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and  _Section 6.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing). Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Metro Parents obligation to cause the Metro Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger and Cable Buyers obligation to cause the 

      ##### 

  

    

Cable Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Cable Transfer and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement only in the event
that (i) Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub are required to complete
the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.2_, (ii) the Debt Financing has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing, (iii) Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete
the Closing pursuant to  _Section 1.2_ and (iv) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or to seek to
enforce specifically Metro Parents obligation to cause the Metro Equity
Financing to be funded to complete the Merger or Cable Buyers obligation to
cause the Cable Equity Financing to be funded to complete the Cable Transfer
if the Cable Debt Financing or the Metro Debt Financing has not been funded
(or will not be funded at the Closing if the Cable Equity Financing and the
Metro Equity Financing are funded at the Closing). In connection with the
performance by Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations
to seek to enforce the terms of the Financing Commitments (or any definitive
agreements related thereto) pursuant to this _Section 8.5_, each of Cable
Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub shall reasonably consult and reasonably
cooperate with the Company in connection with any Action or other enforcement
efforts related to the Financing Commitments by (A) promptly providing the
Company with copies of all material correspondence between Cable Buyer, Metro
Parent or Merger Sub and/or any of their respective Representatives, on the
one hand, and the Lenders, Sponsor and any other applicable party, on the
other hand, (B) keeping the Company advised on a weekly basis with respect to
any such Action or other enforcement efforts and (C) in good faith
considering the views and advice of the Company, in each case, in connection
with the enforcement of the Financing Commitments (or any definitive
agreements related thereto);  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
anything in this sentence be deemed to require any party to disclose
information or otherwise take any action in compliance herewith if such party
reasonably determines that doing so would (I) cause a violation of any
material agreement to which such person is a party, (II) cause a material
risk of loss of privilege to such person, or (III) constitute a violation of
any applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, except as and to the extent expressly permitted by this 
_Section 8.5_, the parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by
Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or Merger Sub or any remedy to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedies set
forth in _Section 7.2_. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the rights of the Parents or their respective affiliates under and to the extent provided in this _Section 8.5_, the Parents and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that each of them has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to damages of the Parents or their respective affiliates, any of the Company Parties (other than the Company to the extent provided in this Agreement), through the Company or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of the Company against any Company Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise. Without limiting the rights of the Company under and to the extent provided in this  _Section 8.5_, the Company acknowledges and agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to damages of the Company and its affiliates, any of the Parent Parties (as defined below) (other than Cable 

      ##### 

  

    

Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement
and Sponsor to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee), through either
Parent or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or
through a claim by or on behalf of either Parent against Sponsor or any other
Parent Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law,
or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from Sponsor (but not any
other Parent Party (including any general partner or managing member)) under
and to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee and subject to the
limitations described therein. Recourse against Sponsor under the Limited
Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its
affiliates against Sponsor and any other Parent Party (other than Cable
Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement)
in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection
with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) For purposes hereof: (i) " _Parent Parties_ " shall mean, collectively, Cable Buyer, Metro Parent, Merger Sub, Sponsor, the Lenders or other funding sources and any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, members, stockholders, affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder, affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing, and (ii) " _Company Parties_ " shall mean, collectively, the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, members, stockholders, affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder, affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing. 

   

 (e) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law), and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.5_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) any claim that (A) the Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject mater hereof, may not be enforced 

      ##### 

  

    

in or by such court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that notice or the
service of process in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated
by _Section 8.7_. 

   

 Section 8.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW) ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. FURTHER, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY OR PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY THIS _SECTION 8.6_.

Any notice, request, instruction or other communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and delivered personally, sent by reputable overnight courier service (charges paid by sender), sent by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid), or sent by facsimile, according to the instructions set forth below.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

  

 Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto), the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Limited Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or between any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as provided in _Section 5.9_ and (b) from and after the Effective Time, if the Effective Time occurs, the rights of holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in _Article II_. 

  

 Section 8.11 _Amendments; Extensions of Time; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such 

   ##### 

  

 

amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Company, Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub, or in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if any
such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market require further approval of
the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or
waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable
Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any
other party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by any
other party hereto with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as
otherwise provided herein, waive any of such partys
conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company, Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder. 

   

 Section 8.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.13 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Cable Buyer, Metro Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly waived by each party. 

  

 Section 8.14 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References in this Agreement to specific laws or to specific provisions of laws shall include all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

   ##### 

 

  

 Section 8.15 _Disclaimer_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto, are for the sole benefit of such parties and are subject to disclosures set forth in the Company SEC Documents and on the Company Disclosure Schedule. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.11_ without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties. Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto should not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

As used in this Agreement, " _knowledge_ " means (i) with respect to Cable Buyer and/or Metro Parent, the actual knowledge of the individuals listed on _Section 8.16(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) with respect to the Company, the actual knowledge of the individuals listed on _Section 8.16(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
