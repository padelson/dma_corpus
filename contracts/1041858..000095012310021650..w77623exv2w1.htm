of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies provided herein will
be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the
parties hereto do not perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this
Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is
accordingly agreed that, subject to <U>Section&nbsp;7.2</U> and <U>Section&nbsp;8.5(b)</U>, prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a
bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of <U>Section
7.2</U>, in the event of any breach of this Agreement by the Company, each of Cable Buyer, Metro
Parent and Merger Sub retain the right to pursue any and all remedies available at law, in equity,
in contract or otherwise, including without limitation specific performance and monetary damages.
Subject to <U>Section&nbsp;8.5(b)</U>, the foregoing right shall include the right of the Company to
cause each of Metro Parent and Merger Sub to seek to enforce the terms of the Metro Equity
Financing and the Debt Financing Commitments related to the Metro Debt Financing (and any
definitive agreements related thereto) and to cause Cable Buyer to seek to enforce the terms of the
Cable Equity Financing and the Debt Financing Commitments related to the Cable Debt Financing (and
any definitive agreements related thereto) against the Lenders, Sponsor and any other applicable
party to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to such Financing Commitments (or any definitive
agreements related thereto) and applicable Laws and to thereafter cause the Cable Transfer and the
Merger to be consummated, in each case, if the conditions set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> and
<U>Section&nbsp;6.3</U> have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which by their nature
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing). Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

Closing, (iii)&nbsp;Cable Buyer, Metro Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;1.2</U> and (iv)&nbsp;the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. For

require any party to disclose information or otherwise take any action in compliance herewith if
such party reasonably determines that doing so would (I)&nbsp;cause a violation of any material
agreement to which such person is a party, (II)&nbsp;cause a material risk of loss of privilege to such
person, or (III)&nbsp;constitute a violation of any applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, except as and to the extent expressly permitted by this
<U>Section&nbsp;8.5</U>, the parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Cable Buyer, Metro Parent or
Merger Sub or any remedy to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
that the Company&#146;s sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedies
set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;7.2</U>.
