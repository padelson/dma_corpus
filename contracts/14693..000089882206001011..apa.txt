III   CLOSING DATE; CASH PAYMENTS; PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT   Section 3.1

"CLOSING") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, at the offices of
Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York, USA on the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions
set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that are to
be satisfied at the Closing), or on such other date or at such other time and
place as the parties hereto agree in writing (the date of the Closing, the
"CLOSING DATE").   Section 3.2 CASH PAYMENTS; ESCROW. (a) On or prior to
the 10th Business Day prior to the Closing, Parent, on behalf of Sellers,
will deliver to Buyer a good faith estimate of (i) Sellers\' calculation of
the gross amount of the Excluded Receivables (inclusive of IVA and IEPS in
respect thereof and excluding any provision for doubtful accounts receivable)
as of the Closing, certified by Sellers and prepared in accordance with
Mexican FIS and the accounting principles used in the preparation of the
Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements and the Interim
Financial Statements, and (ii) Sellers\' calculation of the Other Cash
Payment. Buyer will promptly review the calculation referred to in clause (i)
and clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence and if Buyer shall, in
good faith, have any objections thereto, Parent and Buyer shall use their
respective good faith efforts to resolve such objections and revise Sellers\'
calculation of the Excluded Receivables and to include in such estimate any
changes since the date of delivery of Sellers\' calculation in such Excluded
Receivables up to and including the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers will have sole and
final control over the preparation of and amounts set forth in the estimate
of the Excluded Receivables. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the
immediately preceding sentence will limit the rights of any party under
Section 3.3. At the Closing, Parent, on behalf of Sellers, will deliver to
Buyer the statement of the gross amount of the Excluded Receivables as of the
Closing certified by Sellers and prepared in accordance with the foregoing
sentences of this Section 3.2(a) and incorporating any revisions and changes
in accordance with the immediately foregoing sentence (such statement, the
"EXCLUDED RECEIVABLES STATEMENT"). The gross amount of the Excluded
Receivables included in the Excluded Receivables Statement, net of all IVA
and IEPS in respect of such Excluded Receivables and excluding any provision
for doubtful accounts receivable, will be the "CLOSING EXCLUDED NET
RECEIVABLES." The Closing Excluded Net Receivables will be in Mexican pesos
and converted to United States dollars as of the Closing Date based upon the
average of the noon buying rates in New York City for cable transfers payable
in Mexican pesos, as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for
customs purposes, for each of the 20 Business Days immediately preceding the
Closing Date.   -7-     (b) At the Closing, (i) Buyer will pay to the
Sellers an amount equal to the Other Cash Payment less the sum of (A) the
amount of the Escrowed Funds and (B) the Receivables Holdback, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated in
writing by Parent, in consideration for the sale, transfer, conveyance and
assignment of the Assets (other than the Trademarks) to Buyer pursuant to
Section 1.1, and (ii) BFC will pay to Tequila Herradura an amount equal to
the difference between the Initial Purchase Price and the Other Cash Payment
(such difference, the "TRADEMARK CASH PAYMENT"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated in writing by
Parent, in consideration for the sale, transfer, conveyance and assignment of
the Trademarks to BFC pursuant to Section 1.1. Notice of any account to which
funds are to be wire transferred as provided above will be delivered to BFC
and Buyer at least five Business Days prior to the Closing.   (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, $22,000,000 of the Initial Purchase Price (the
"ESCROWED FUNDS") will be delivered by Buyer by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to one of the escrow agents set forth on SCHEDULE 3.2(C)
agreed to by Buyer and Parent (or, if none of such escrow agents shall be
available to serve in such capacity or the parties hereto otherwise agree in
writing, such other major financial institution located in the United States
of America agreed to by Buyer and Parent) ("ESCROW AGENT") under an escrow
agreement substantially in the form of EXHIBIT A with such changes thereto as
Buyer and Sellers may agree (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT") to be entered into on
the Closing Date by Sellers, Buyer, BFC and the Escrow Agent.   Section 3.3

the Sellers a statement of Working Capital of the Business as of the Closing

EXCLUDED RECEIVABLES") and a balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing
Date (the "CLOSING DATE BALANCE SHEET", and together with the Closing
Statement of Working Capital and the Closing Statement of
Excluded Receivables, the "CLOSING STATEMENTS"). Parent and its accountant,
in the name and on behalf of Sellers, will have the right to participate in
the preparation of the Closing Statements, including by having the right to
consult with Buyer concerning the method of presentation and formulation of
the Closing Statements, and Buyer will consider in good faith the comments of
Parent with respect thereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, but without in any way limiting or affecting
Sellers\' or Parent\'s right to object as provided in Section 3.3(c), Buyer
will have sole and final control over the preparation of and amounts set
forth in the Closing Statements to be delivered to Sellers as provided in the
first sentence of this Section 3.3(a). The Closing Date Balance Sheet will
consist of the assets and liabilities transferred to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement. The Closing Statement of Working Capital will be derived from the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, present Closing Date Working Capital in
reasonably sufficient detail to determine any amounts owing to Buyer or
Parent under this Section 3.3, be presented in substantially the form of
SCHEDULE 3.3 and include only those assets and liabilities transferred to
Buyer hereunder. The Closing Statement of   -8-   Working Capital and
Closing Date Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with Mexican FIS
and the accounting principles used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements and Interim Statements, including those set forth on SCHEDULE 3.3,
applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Financial
Statements and Interim Statements except as otherwise provided on SCHEDULE
3.3, and in accordance with any other methodologies set forth on SCHEDULE
3.3. The Closing Statement of Excluded Receivables will present Closing Date
Excluded Receivables in reasonably sufficient detail to determine any amounts
owing to Buyer or Parent under this Section 3.3 and be prepared in accordance
with Mexican FIS and the accounting principles used in the preparation of the
Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements and the Interim
Financial Statements and otherwise consistent with the calculation of the
Closing Excluded Net Receivables in accordance with Section 3.2(a).
All calculations under this Section 3.3 will be in Mexican pesos and
converted to United States dollars as of the Closing Date based upon the
average of the noon buying rates in New York City for cable transfers payable
in Mexican pesos, as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for
customs purposes, for each of the 20 Business Days immediately preceding the
Closing Date.   (b) Parent will notify Buyer in writing of any objection to
the calculation of the Closing Statement of Working Capital, the Closing
Statement of Excluded Receivables or the Closing Date Balance Sheet no later
than 30 days after Buyer\'s delivery of the Closing Statements to Parent.
Such notice of objection will specify in reasonable detail such items that
Parent believes are not calculated properly and the reasons therefor. Buyer
and Parent will negotiate in good faith to resolve such disputed items. In
the event that Buyer and Parent shall not have resolved all such items in
writing within 30 days after such notice of objection, such parties will

past) material audit relationship with any party hereto) (the "ACCOUNTANT")
for resolution. The Accountant will, within 30 days after such submission,
make a determination of those disputed items in accordance with
this Agreement. The decision of the Accountant will be delivered in a written
report addressed to Buyer and Parent and will be binding and conclusive upon
the parties hereto. The costs and fees of the Accountant will be borne one-

in the Closing Statement of Working Capital (as adjusted, if a proper notice

agreement of Parent and Buyer and/or the written report prepared by the
Accountant in accordance with Section 3.3(b)) is referred to as the "CLOSING
DATE WORKING CAPITAL", and the Excluded Receivables set forth in the Closing
Statement of Excluded Receivables (as adjusted, if a proper notice of
objection is received in accordance with Section 3.3(b), by the written
agreement of Parent and   -9-    Buyer and/or the written report

Working Capital is less than the difference between (i) the Target Working
Capital and (ii) 5,000,000 Mexican pesos, the Initial Purchase Price will be
reduced by the aggregate amount of the difference between the Target Working
Capital and the Closing Date Working Capital. If the Closing Date Working
Capital is greater than the sum of (i) the Target Working Capital and (ii)
5,000,000 Mexican pesos, the Initial Purchase Price will be increased by the
aggregate amount of the difference between the Closing Date Working Capital
and the Target Working Capital. If the Closing Date Working Capital is at
least equal to the difference between (i) the Target Working Capital and (ii)
5,000,000 Mexican pesos but less than or equal to the sum of (A) the Target
Working Capital and (B) 5,000,000 Mexican pesos, the Initial Purchase Price
will not be adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.3(d)(i).   (ii) If the
Closing Date Excluded Receivables is less than the Closing Excluded Net
Receivables, the Initial Purchase Price will be increased by the aggregate

is greater than the Closing Excluded Net Receivables, the Initial Purchase
Price will be reduced by the aggregate amount of the difference between the
Closing Date Excluded Receivables and the Closing Excluded Net Receivables.
If the Closing Date Excluded Receivables is equal to the Closing Excluded Net
Receivables, the Initial Purchase Price will not be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 3.3(d)(ii).   (iii)The aggregate amount of the reduction to the
Initial Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 3.3(d) (taking into
account the net effect of any increases or reductions in the Initial Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 3.3(d)(i) and Section 3.3(d)(ii)), if any, is
referred to herein as the "SHORTFALL", and the aggregate amount of the
increase in the Initial Purchase Price in accordance with this Section
3.3(d), if any, is referred to as the "OVERAGE".   (e) Notwithstanding the
foregoing:   (i) if the Initial Purchase Price is reduced as provided in 
Section 3.3(d), then (A) if the Shortfall is less than or equal to the 
Receivables Holdback, Buyer will (1) pay Parent, on behalf of Sellers, an 
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the Receivables Holdback  and
the Shortfall and (2) retain from the Receivables Holdback an amount,  if
any, equal to the difference between the Receivables Holdback and the  amount
referred to in the immediately preceding clause (1); and (B) if the 
Shortfall is greater than the Receivables Holdback, Buyer will (1) retain 
the Receivables Holdback and (2) Parent, on behalf of Sellers, will pay 
Buyer an amount equal to the difference between the Shortfall and the

or if there is  no adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price, in each case, as
provided in  Section   -10-     3.3(d), Buyer will pay to Parent, on
behalf of Sellers, (A) the entire  amount of the Receivables Holdback and (B)
an amount equal to the Overage,  if any.   (f) Any amounts (including
amounts released to Sellers from the  Receivables Holdback) required to be
paid as provided in Section 3.3(e)  will be paid by bank wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an  account designated in writing by the party
entitled to receive such payment  and will bear interest from the Closing
Date to the date of payment at the  prime rate as reported in the WALL STREET
JOURNAL on the Business Day  immediately prior to the Closing Date, which
interest will be paid on the  same date as such payment.   (g) In the event
that Buyer shall receive any payments in respect  of the Purchased
Receivables after the Closing and prior to the  Determination Date, Buyer
will pay to Parent an amount equal to the portion  of such payment
attributable to IVA and IEPS. For purposes of determining  the portion of the
payment attributable to IVA and IEPS, the payment  received by Buyer will be
deemed to consist of a payment in respect of the  Purchased Receivables plus
the applicable IVA and IEPS on such payment such  that the sum of such
payment and IVA and IEPS is equal to the total payment  received.   Section

Business infringe or  conflict in any material respect with the rights of
others in respect of  any Intellectual Property or any intellectual property

any special requirements for storage of ingredients, and  a description of
all processes for the manufacturing of the Products,  including fermentation,
distillation, aging, rectifying, processing,  handling, storing and bottling.

each  of the Purchased Subsidiaries to pay or cause to be paid the Taxes
shown to  be due thereon. Sellers will furnish to Buyer all information and
records  in their possession and reasonably requested by Buyer for use in 
preparation of any such Tax Returns relating to a Straddle Period or  Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Buyer will allow the Sellers to review, comment  upon,
and reasonably approve without undue delay any such Tax Returns for a  Pre-
Closing Tax Period ("PRE-CLOSING TAX RETURNS") or Straddle Period Tax 
Returns beginning at least 45 days before the filing of the Pre-Closing Tax 
Returns or Straddle Period Tax Returns. At least five days prior to the due 
date of any tax liability with respect to such Tax Return, the Sellers will 
pay to Buyer, and Buyer will pay when due, an amount equal to the Sellers\' 
share of any such tax liability, PROVIDED Sellers have approved such Tax 
Returns.   (c) TAX COOPERATION. The Sellers and Buyer will reasonably 
cooperate, and will cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, 
agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate (including by 
maintaining and making available to each other all relevant records), in 
preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes and 
audits with respect to Taxes of any Purchased Subsidiary (or with respect  to
the Business or the Assets) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and for any 
Straddle Period.   (d) CONTESTS. Upon receipt by Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer of  any notice of any Audit with respect to Excluded Taxes or any other
Taxes  for which the Sellers may be liable hereunder (any such Audit, a
"TAX  MATTER"), Buyer will notify the Sellers of any such Tax Matter within
(x)  three Business Days if, under applicable Law, the written response to
such  Tax Matter is required within 20 days after the receipt by Buyer of
such  notice of such Tax Matter, and (y) ten calendar days in all other
cases.  The Sellers may, at their expense, participate in and, upon notice
to  Buyer, assume the defense of any such Tax Matter. Upon receipt of such 
notice from Sellers, Buyer will grant to Sellers a special and limited  power
of attorney in favor of Sellers, duly authenticated by a Mexican  notary
public, for lawsuits and collections to permit Sellers to properly  defend or
contest such Tax Matter. No delay in or failure by Buyer to give  notice of
such Tax Matter or to deliver such power of attorney pursuant to  this
Section 8.3(d) will alter or relieve the Sellers of their obligation  to
indemnify Buyer, except to the extent that the Sellers are prejudiced 
thereby or are prevented or in any way restricted from being able to assume 
the defense of such Tax Matter. If the Sellers assume such defense, the 
Sellers will have the authority, with respect to any Tax Matter, to 
represent the interests of the   -42-     applicable Purchased
Subsidiary before the relevant Taxing Authority and  will have the right to
control the defense, compromise or other resolution  of any such Tax Matter,
including responding to inquiries and contesting,  defending against and
resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or  notice of Tax deficiency or
other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to,  such Tax Matter; provided,
however, the Sellers will not enter into any  settlement of or otherwise
compromise any such Tax Matter to the extent  that it could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the Tax liability  of any Purchased Subsidiary
for a period (or portion thereof) beginning  after the Closing Date without
the prior written consent of Buyer, which  consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Buyer has the right (but not  the duty) to participate in the
defense of such Tax Matter and to employ  counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the  Sellers. If Buyer elects to
participate in the defense of any Tax Matter,  then (i) Buyer shall be
entitled to (A) without in any way limiting or  affecting Sellers\' right to
assume the defense of such Tax Matter,  participate fully in the conduct of
such Tax Matter, including  participating in all conferences and attending
all meetings with the  relevant authorities, and (B) consult with the
Sellers, at its own expense,  regarding any such Tax Matter, and Sellers
shall consider in good faith any  suggestions made by Buyer, (ii) the Sellers
shall provide Buyer with a copy  of all documents (or portions thereof)
relating to such Tax Matter and  (iii) the Sellers will not enter into any
settlement of or otherwise  compromise any such Tax Matter to the extent that
it could reasonably be  expected to adversely affect the Tax liability of any
Purchased Subsidiary  for a period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date without  the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall
not be unreasonably  withheld. The Sellers will allow Buyer to consult with
Sellers regarding  the conduct of or positions taken in any such
proceeding.   (e) COOPERATION. The parties hereto will cooperate with each 
other in contesting any Tax Claim of any Purchased Subsidiary, which 
cooperation will include the retention and, upon request of any party 
hereto, the provision of records and information which are reasonably 
relevant to such Tax Claim and making employees available to provide 
additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder; 
provided, however, subject to Section 8.2, that the parties hereto need  only
retain records and information in accordance with their record  retention
policy unless timely and promptly notified in writing by any  other party
hereto.   (f) REFUNDS. The Sellers will be entitled to any Tax refunds (or 
reductions in Tax liability), including interest paid therewith, in respect 
of Taxes paid by any Purchased Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing 
Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period (applying the principles set  forth
in Section 8.3(h)), other than any IVA or IEPS. Buyer will forward to  the
Sellers any such Tax refunds received or reductions utilized by it to  which
the Sellers are entitled within 10 days after receipt or utilization  net of
any costs to Buyer or any of its Affiliates.   -43-    (g) AMENDMENT OF
TAX RETURNS. None of Buyer and its Affiliates  will amend, refile, revoke or
otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax  election of any Purchased Subsidiary
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax  Period or Straddle Period without the
prior written consent of the Sellers,  which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.   (h) TAX PRORATION. For purposes of this Agreement,
the portion  of Tax with respect to the income, property or operations of any
Purchased  Subsidiary or Corporate Seller that is attributable to a Straddle
Period  will be apportioned between the period of the Straddle Period that
extends  before the Closing Date through the Closing Date (the "PRE-CLOSING
STRADDLE  PERIOD") and the period of the Straddle Period that extends from
the day  after the Closing Date to the end of the Straddle Period (the "POST-
CLOSING  STRADDLE PERIOD") in accordance with this Section 8.3(h). Except
as  otherwise provided in Section 8.4(b), the portion of such Tax
attributable  to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period (i) in the case of any Taxes
other than  sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes,
withholding taxes,  and any Tax based on, or measured by, income, receipts or
profits earned  during a Straddle Period, shall be deemed equal to the amount
of such Tax  for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of  which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period,
and  denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and
(ii)  in the case of any sales or use taxes, value added taxes, employment
taxes,  withholding taxes and any Tax based on or measured by income,
receipts or  profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the
amount that  would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included
the Closing  Date. To the extent that any Tax for a Straddle Period is based
on the  greater of a Tax on net income, on the one hand, and a Tax measured
by net  worth or some other basis not otherwise measured by income, on the
other  hand, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period  will be deemed to be (A) if the amount of such Tax for the Straddle
Period  is measured by net worth or such other basis, the amount of such
Tax  determined as though the taxable values for the entire Straddle Period 
equal the respective values as of the end of the Closing Date and 
multiplying the amount of such Tax by a fraction, the numerator of which is 
the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing 
Straddle Period, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the 
Straddle Period or (B) if the amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period is 
measured by net income, the amount of such Tax determined as though the 
applicable Tax period terminated at the end of the day on the Closing Date. 
For purposes of this Section 8.3(h), any exemption, deduction, credit or 
other item that is calculated on an annual basis will be allocated to the 
Pre-Closing Straddle Period on a pro rata basis by multiplying the total 
amount of such items for the Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator  of
which is the number of calendar days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period,  and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle 
Period.  (i) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall provide to Buyer a transfer
pricing study  (ESTUDIO DE PRECIO DE TRANSFERENCIA) for each of the 2004 and
2005   -44-     fiscal years (the "TRANSFER PRICING STUDIES") with
respect to any  transactions between Tequila Herradura and any foreign
related party  (within the meaning of Mexican Income Tax Law (LEY DEL
IMPUESTO SOBRE LA  RENTA)) which Transfer Pricing Studies shall be similar in
form and  substance to the transfer pricing studies previously delivered to
Buyer  with respect to 2003 and which satisfy the requirements of Mexican
Income  Tax Law (LEY DEL IMPUESTO SOBRE LA RENTA).   Section 8.4
PRORATIONS. (a) All Utility Charges will be apportioned between Sellers and
Buyer as of the Closing Date. Sellers and Buyer will cooperate in (i)
assuring that Utility Charges are promptly paid and (ii) having meter
readings for Utility Charges and other necessary arrangements carried out so
that Utility Charges relating to periods of time after the Closing Date
are billed directly to Buyer. For purposes of this Section 8.4(a),
"UTILITY CHARGES" means water, sewer, electricity, gas, telephone and other
utility charges, if any, applicable to the Owned Real Property or the Real
Property Leases.   (b) Real Property Taxes (as defined below) and all
Personal Property Taxes (as defined below) with respect to the Assets will be
prorated as of the Closing Date with (i) Sellers being liable for such taxes
relating to any time period or periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) Buyer being liable for such taxes relating to any time period or
periods beginning after the Closing Date. Proration of Real Property Taxes
and Personal Property Taxes will be made on the basis of the most recent
officially certified tax valuation and assessment for the Assets. If such
valuation pertains to a tax period other than that in which the Closing
occurs, such apportionment will be recalculated at such time as actual tax
bills for such period are available, and the parties will cooperate with each
other in all respects in connection with such recalculation and pay any sums
due in consequence thereof to the party entitled to recover the same within
60 days after the issuance of such actual tax bills. For purposes of this
Section 8.4(b), "REAL PROPERTY TAXES" mean real property taxes, ad valorem
taxes, general assessments and special assessments with respect to real
property. "PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES" mean ad valorem taxes with respect to the
Assets other than real property.   Section 8.5 WASTE TREATMENT PLANT
COMPLETION. Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to complete construction of the waste water
treatment plant described in SCHEDULE 1.3(V). Sellers will use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer with information, documentation and advice
relating to the completion of the construction and the operation of the waste
water treatment plant described in SCHEDULE 1.3(V). Buyer will, as promptly
as practicable, reimburse Sellers for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of any Seller to the extent incurred in connection with Sellers\'
obligations under the immediately preceding sentence.   Section 8.6 POST
CLOSING MATTERS RELATED TO PERMITS. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing, but in no event later than 90 (ninety) calendar days after
the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall enter into an assignment
agreement     -45-   substantially in the form of the Water Rights
Assignment whereby Tequila Herradura will assign to Buyer all rights and
interests to the Water Correction Permits (to the extent and as permitted by
applicable Law). Buyer and Sellers will jointly, at the sole cost and expense
of Buyer, file with Mexico\'s National Waters Commission or other competent
Governmental Authorities the Water Rights Assignment for all Water Correction
Permits (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law), together with
any forms, exhibits or documents required by applicable Law, and register
such assignments with Mexico\'s Public Registry of Water Rights as
applicable, and fulfill all other legal requirements in terms of applicable
Law, of the contemplated Water Rights Assignment (including with respect to
the Underground Water Rights and the Water Correction Permits,
as applicable). Buyer and Sellers will be jointly responsible for all
related filing and notice requirements in connection with the Water Rights
Assignments related to the Water Correction Permits and the Underground Water
Rights if and as applicable in accordance with applicable Law, and any and
all other acts required for such assignment after the Closing. Sellers will
timely provide Buyers with any and all documentation requested by the
National Water Commission related to the Water Rights Assignment (including
with respect to the Underground Water Rights and the Water Correction
Permits, as applicable).   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 8.6(a), the Sellers shall be under no obligation to
assign or enter into any Water Rights Assignment with respect to any Water
Correction Permit that may have been denied by a competent Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable Law.   (b) Upon reasonable advance
written notice from Buyer, Sellers will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Buyer with the filing of any and all notices, applications,
documents or other similar requirements before the National Waters Commission
or any other competent Governmental Authorities to obtain the assignment of
any relevant Permits not listed on SCHEDULE 7.1(C)(IV) (to the extent
permitted by applicable law), including the approval of the Water Rights
Assignments (both with respect to the Underground Water Rights and the Water
Correction Permits, as applicable), and including by appearing before a
notary public to ratify all of the Water Rights Assignments (including those
related to the Underground Water Rights and the Water Correction Permits),
and shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all
such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions, as may be reasonably necessary to achieve the
foregoing.   Section 8.7 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. (a) After the
Closing, at Buyer\'s request and expense, Sellers or their designee will
execute and deliver such additional documents and shall take such further
actions as may be reasonably required to allow Buyer (or its applicable
Affiliate) to record with all applicable Governmental Authorities its
ownership of all Intellectual Property. Buyer will be solely responsible for
all filing, attorneys\' or other fees incurred in connection with such
additional documents and recordations. In the event that for whatever reason
the registration of the assignment of the Intellectual Property is objected
to by the Mexican Industrial Property Institute (INSTITUTO MEXICANO DE LA
PROPIEDAD INDUSTRIAL), or by any other Governmental Authority  
-46-    or by any third party whether in Mexico or throughout the world,
Sellers and their Affiliates will use their best efforts and cooperate
diligently with Buyer, including executing any document that may be required
or convenient for the registration of the relevant assignment. Sellers and
their Affiliates will comply with such obligation within five Business Days
following Buyer\'s written request to do so.   (b) Sellers acknowledge
that, after the Closing, the Intellectual Property set forth on SCHEDULE
4.5(B) and all goodwill arising out of the use thereof shall inure to the
sole benefit of Buyer.   (c) Each of Sellers and Buyer will not, and will
cause each of their controlled Affiliates not to, produce, market,
manufacture or distributed or sell (for themselves or any third parties) any
beverage alcohol products bearing the names that comprise Excluded Marks. The
parties will cooperate with each other to ensure that third parties do not
use any of the Excluded Marks as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence.   (d) If, after the Closing, any of the Sellers is issued or for
any reason is deemed to be the owner or beneficiary, in any country, of any
right, title or interest in any registration covering any of the Intellectual
Property, or any mark that is confusingly similar to, or a translation and
or transliteration of, the marks on SCHEDULE 4.5(B) (collectively, the
"RELATED MARKS"), such Seller or Sellers will so notify Buyer and agree that
it has acted or will act as an agent on and for Buyer\'s behalf, and will
execute any and all instruments deemed by Buyer, its attorneys or
representatives, to be necessary to transfer such right, title or interest in
or to the Related Marks to Buyer. Related Marks will thereafter be considered
included in the defined term Intellectual Property for all purposes of this
Section 8.7.   (e) Each of Sellers further covenants and agrees that, after
the Closing, it shall not, directly or indirectly through any direct family
member (that is, the current or former spouse of any Seller or any descendant
of any Seller), agent, employee, affiliate or representative, and will cause
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries not to:   (i) use and/or register anywhere
in the world any of the  Intellectual Property, or anything identical or
confusingly similar  thereto;   (ii) make any attempt, file any document
with any Governmental  Authority, or take any other action to challenge,
dispute, attack, contest  or adversely affect the full and exclusive
ownership or validity of Buyer\'s  rights in the Intellectual Property;
including the use, validity, term,  enforceability and/or any modification or
translation of the Intellectual  Property, or the Trademarks, before the
Mexican Industrial Property  Institute (INSTITUTO MEXICANO DE LA PROPIEDAD
INDUSTRIAL) or any other  Governmental Authority or Person; in particular,
the Sellers and their  Affiliates will not challenge, claim, dispute or
demand in the future,  anywhere in the world, the right of Buyer to use
and/or register the  Intellectual Property and the Trademarks, as well as any
other mark,  trademark, service mark, brand name, design, commercial
advertisements,   -47-     domain names, trade names, slogans or other
intellectual property rights  either identical or similar, to the extent of
confusion with the  Intellectual Property and the Trademarks, anywhere in the
world;   (iii) make use of, in connection with any other beverage product, 
any imagery, packaging, bottles, trade dress or advertising that are 
confusingly similar to those used by the Business;   (iv) disparage the
Business, the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities  or the Intellectual Property;
or   (v) aid or abet anyone else in doing any of the foregoing acts.  
Section 8.8 REMOVAL OF CERTAIN ASSETS. All tangible property constituting
Assets that is located on the Las Norias Real Property (but not including any
Excluded Assets located thereon) will be moved by Buyer, at Buyer\'s sole
cost and expense, within 180 calendar days after the Closing Date from the
Las Norias Real Property and in a manner so as to not cause damage to such
premises. Buyer will give Seller reasonable advance notice of the date(s) on
which Buyer intends to remove such property, and Sellers or their
designee will have the right to be present during such removal.   Section
8.9 CERTAIN INSURANCE MATTERS. With respect to any loss, liability or damage
suffered by Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date relating
to, resulting from or arising out of the conduct of the Business prior to the
Closing, for which any Seller or any of its Affiliates would be entitled to
assert, or cause any other Person to assert, a claim for recovery under any
policy of insurance that is an Excluded Asset in respect of the Business,
each of the Sellers, at the request of Buyer, will use its reasonable efforts
(a) to cause BFC and Buyer to be added as named insureds under each
such policy effective from and after the Closing and (b) to assert one or
more claims under any such policy of insurance covering such loss, liability
or damage if Buyer is not itself entitled to assert such claim and to pay all
amounts received in respect of such claims to Buyer, PROVIDED that all of
each such Seller\'s reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the foregoing are promptly reimbursed by Buyer. Nothing in
this Section 8.9 will affect or modify or be deemed to affect or modify in
any way any of any Seller\'s obligations under Article IX of this
Agreement.   Section 8.10 EMPLOYER SUBSTITUTION. As promptly as practicable
after the Closing, Buyer will notify the Business Employees in writing, in
accordance with the provisions of Article 41 of the Mexican Federal Labor
Law, of the occurrence of an Employer Labor Substitution (as defined under
the Mexican Federal Labor Law), and will procure the execution of an Employee
Substitution Agreement (as defined under the Mexican Federal Labor Law) among
Buyer, Sellers and the corresponding union. Each of the Sellers will, within
five Business Days after the Closing, withdraw all Business Employees before
INSTITUTO MEXICANO DEL SEGURO SOCIAL, INSTITUTO DEL FONDO NACIONAL DE LA
VIVIENDA PARA LOS TRABAJADORES or SISTEMA DE AHORRO PARA EL RETIRO and
provide   -48-    evidence thereof to Buyer. In the event that Buyer or
any assignee of Buyer permitted hereunder is not also the employer of the
Business Employees after the Closing, Buyer or each such assignee will, as
promptly as practicable, enter into a written agreement with such employer
pursuant to which such employer will provide all employee services to Buyer
or such assignee.   Section 8.11 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. From and
after the Closing, Buyer will honor the existing Collective Bargaining
Agreements listed on SCHEDULE 4.13(A) pursuant to which Buyer will provide to
all Business Employees the same terms and conditions of employment, including
in respect of wage levels, job classifications, benefits and seniority, that
existed immediately prior to the Closing. Each of Sellers will, and will,
where applicable, cause its respective directors, officers and employees to,
use their reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer and its Affiliates in their
discussions with the corresponding unions.   Section 8.12 THE HACIENDA AND
RELATED LANDS. Buyer and Sellers agree to the terms and conditions set forth
on SCHEDULE 8.12 with respect to (a) the Hacienda and (b) the Owned Real
Property identified on SCHEDULE 8.12, effective from and after the
Closing.   Section 8.13 RELEASE. Effective at the Closing each of the
Sellers and the Additional Seller Parties hereby agrees to unconditionally,
irrevocably and forever release and discharge BFC, Buyer, and each of their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns and any present or former
directors, officers, employees or agents of any of the foregoing (in each
case after giving effect to the Closing and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) (collectively, the "RELEASED PARTIES") of and from, and
hereby agrees to unconditionally, irrevocably and forever waive any and all
claims, debts, losses, expenses, proceedings, covenants, liabilities, suits,
judgments, damages, actions and causes of action, rights, obligations,
accounts, and liabilities, of any kind or character whatsoever, known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, contingent or non contingent, direct or
indirect, at law or in equity, arising out of, resulting from or relating to
the Business, the Assets, the Trademarks or the Related Marks, in each case
that such Persons ever had, now has or ever may in the future have or claim
to have against any Released Party, for or by reason of any matter,
circumstance, event, action, inaction, omission, cause or thing whatsoever
arising prior to, on or after the date hereof; PROVIDED that this Section
8.13 shall not apply to (i) the rights of any Seller or any Additional Seller
Party under this Agreement or under any Ancillary Agreement or (ii) any of
the obligations of any Released Party under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, including in respect of the Assumed Liabilities.   Section 8.14
SELLER NON-COMPETE. (a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "NON-COMPETE
PERIOD"), none of the Sellers and the Additional Seller Parties and none of
their respective controlled Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly
(including through any controlled Affiliate), (i) produce,
market, manufacture, distribute or sell (for themselves or a third party), or
(ii) license or otherwise permit any Person to use either the Excluded Marks
or the Intellectual Property in connection with: (A) any products or services
that   -49-    use imagery, packaging, bottles, trade dress or
advertising that imitates or is confusingly similar to that of any of the
Products, the Trademarks or the Related Marks or containing or marketed,
advertised, distributed or sold using the Products, the Trademarks or the
Related Marks, (B) any products containing or marketed, advertised,
distributed or sold as containing beverage alcohol, tequila or products
containing tequila, tequila-like flavors or agave, or (C) any alcoholic
beverages with advertising that refers to or compares itself to the Business
or the names "SAN JOSE DEL REFUGIO" or "HACIENDA SAN JOSE DEL REFUGIO" or any
likeness of the Hacienda. Without limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Sellers and the Additional Seller Parties acknowledges and agrees that the
provisions of this Section 8.14 and Section 8.7 would preclude in all cases
and in perpetuity each of the Sellers, the Additional Seller Parties
and their respective controlled Affiliates from selling any such products
with advertising that refers to or compares itself to the Business, the
Intellectual Property (including the Trademarks) or the Excluded Marks.  
(b) Each of the Sellers and the Additional Seller Parties understands and
acknowledges that (i) it would be difficult to calculate damages to
Buyer from any breach of their obligations under this Section 8.14, (ii)
injury to Buyer from any such breach would be irreparable and impossible to
measure and (iii) the remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach of
this Section 8.14 would therefore be an inadequate remedy and, accordingly,
Buyer shall, in addition to all other available remedies (including seeking
such damages as it can show it has sustained by reason of such breach and/or
the exercise of all other rights it has under this Agreement), be entitled to
seek injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable remedies
without the necessity of showing actual damages or posting bond.   (c) The
parties understand and acknowledge that the restrictive covenants and other
agreements contained in this Section 8.14 are an essential part of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is the
intention of the parties that, if any of the restrictions or
covenants contained in this Section 8.14 are held to cover a geographic area
or to be for a length of time that is not permitted by any applicable Law, or
is in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such
provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to
the extent that such provision would then be valid or enforceable under any
applicable Law, such provision shall be construed and interpreted or reformed
to provide for a restriction or covenant having the maximum enforceable
geographic area, time period and other provisions as shall be valid and
enforceable under any applicable Law. The parties also understand and
acknowledge that nothing in this Section 8.14 shall limit, diminish or
abrogate any obligation of the Sellers or any of the Additional Seller
Parties under this Section 8.14 to refrain from limiting, infringing or
violating any of Buyer\'s or BFC\'s right, title and interest in, to and
under the Intellectual Property, the Trademarks or the Related Marks.  
Section 8.15 TEQUILA ADVISORY BOARD. BFC and the Romo Brothers recognize the
rich tradition and history that the Romo family has built surrounding the
Tequila Herradura and El Jimador brands. In order to best enable BFC to
capture the value that this heritage brings to the brands and to
provide advice to BFC about the   -50-    business and the industry,
the Romo de la Pena Brothers each agree to serve as a member of the Tequila
Advisory Board of Buyer (the "TEQUILA ADVISORY BOARD") for a period of at
least one year after the Closing. The Romo de la Pena Brothers and BFC may
extend the term of the Tequila Advisory Board if both BFC and the Romo de la
Pena Brothers jointly elect to do so in their respective discretion. The
Tequila Advisory Board will serve an advisory function to Buyer with
respect to the transition and operation of the Business by Buyer and its
group companies, the tequila industry in Mexico, governmental and regulatory
matters relating to the Business, the agave production and supply business
and the tequila suppliers, wholesalers, retailers and other customers. The
Romo de la Pena Brothers will advise BFC in respect of the traditions and
heritage built around the Tequila Herradura and El Jimador brands. Members of
the Tequila Advisory Board will agree to act in the best interests of the
Business and will not act contrary to or compete with the Business. (For the
avoidance of doubt, the Tequila Advisory Board will be an advisory body and
shall not have decision-making or operational authority with respect to the
Business.) The Tequila Advisory Board will be expected to meet two to four
times per calendar year at such times, and at such places, primarily in
Mexico and the United States, as may be selected by Buyer. Buyer will
reimburse each of the Romo de la Pena Brothers for his reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and travel expenses incurred in connection with the performance
of his duties as a member of the Tequila Advisory Board.   Section 8.16
BONUS MATTERS. Seller may, but will have no obligation to, pay certain
bonuses to each of the Business Employees set forth on SCHEDULE 4.7 in the
amounts set forth opposite such person\'s name in such Schedule (the "SALE
BONUS"). Any such Sale Bonus would be a single payment conditioned upon the
Closing and would be paid by the Sellers. As a condition to any payment
to the Business Employee by Sellers of the Sale Bonus, the relevant
Business Employee will execute and deliver a receipt which, among others
includes the acknowledgements, agreements and releases issued by the Business
Employees to its current and future employer (including Buyer or any
substitute employer of the Business Employees designated by Buyer) in
substantially the terms set forth in SCHEDULE 4.7, and all communications
with the Business Employees will include such acknowledgements, agreements
and releases. Sellers will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer or any
substitute employer of the Business Employees designated by Buyer for any
Losses to the extent resulting from any Business Employee\'s requests or
claims, by any means, that (a) the payment made under any Sale Bonus be
replicated thereafter on an annual basis, or (b) be included as part of
the daily integrated salary of the relevant Business Employee for the
calculation of any severance payment made to such Business Employee who
received the Sales Bonus for any reason, and Sellers agree that all such
Losses and Sale Bonuses shall be deemed to be Excluded Liabilities for all
purposes of this Agreement.   Section 8.17 CERTAIN RECEIVABLES MATTERS. (a)
In the event that Buyer shall not have collected the Excluded Receivables of
Sazerac Company, Inc. or Wilson Daniels, Ltd. as of the Determination Date
that were not in dispute as a result of any act or omission of Sellers by
such Person as of the Closing, Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the
uncollected amounts (net of IVA and IEPS) under such Excluded Receivables to
Parent, on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer shall thereafter be entitled to  
-51-    receive all amounts payable in respect of such Excluded
Receivables for Buyer\'s own account. In the event that any Products
underlying the Excluded Receivables shall be returned to Tequila Herradura,
Tequila Herradura will sell to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase from Tequila
Herradura, all such Products to the extent saleable for a purchase price in
cash equal to the inventory cost of such Products as of the Closing (i.e.,
net of margin).   (b) Buyer will endeavor to collect the Purchased
Receivables consistent with BFC\'s best business practices applicable to
BFC\'s accounts receivable and, as promptly as practicable after the end of
each calendar month (but in any event within five Business Days after the end
of each such month) after the Closing, provide Sellers with a reasonably
detailed written summary of all collection activities in respect of the
Purchase Receivables during such month; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) in the
exercise of such efforts Buyer may, but shall not be obligated to, commence
any litigation to collect any Purchased Receivables and Sellers shall have
the right to commence litigation to collect any such Purchased Receivable
that have been transferred to Sellers pursuant to clause (ii) of this
sentence; (ii) with respect to any such Purchased Receivables that have not
been collected in full at any time after the Determination Date, Sellers will
have the right by written notice to Buyer to assume collection of and
responsibility for any such Purchased Receivables and if Sellers so elect,
Buyer will (A) transfer and assign to Sellers (without any consideration
therefor) all of Buyer\'s right, title and interest in and to such Purchased
Receivables and be released from any obligation with respect to
such Purchased Receivables and (B) as promptly as practicable after it
receives any payment in respect of such Purchased Receivables, turn over and
pay to Parent, on behalf of Sellers, such payment; (iii) if Buyer modifies or
alters the payment terms (including as a result of any settlement) of any
Purchased Receivable to provide that it will be payable after the
Determination Date or would otherwise adversely affect Sellers\' right or
ability to collect the remaining balance of such account receivable in full
in any material respect, such Purchased Receivable will be deemed, for the
purpose of determining the Closing Date Working Capital under Section 3.3, to
have been collected in full; and (iv) any collections from a customer which
is both an obligor with respect to a Purchased Receivable and an account
receivable generated after the Closing shall, unless such Purchased
Receivable is in dispute as of the Closing as a result of any act or omission
of Sellers, be applied against amounts payable in respect of such Purchased
Receivable until such Purchased Receivable is paid in full. In the event that
any Products underlying the Purchased Receivables shall be returned to
Tequila Herradura, Tequila Herradura will sell to Buyer, and Buyer will
purchase from Tequila Herradura, all such Products to the extent saleable for
a purchase price in cash equal to the Standard Cost of such Products as of
the Closing (i.e., net of margin).   (c) In the event Buyer collects or
receives any payment in respect of any Purchased Receivable, Buyer shall
remit to Parent, on behalf of the Sellers, the portion of such payment
constituting IVA and IEPS, and the Sellers shall as promptly as practicable
pay over such portion to the appropriate Tax Authority and shall provide
Buyer appropriate written evidence of such prompt payment. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event Buyer makes a payment in respect of any trade
accounts payable constituting Assumed Liabilities, Buyer may reduce the
amount to be remitted   -52-    to the Sellers pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence by an amount (the "REDUCTION AMOUNT") equal to
the portion of any payment made by Buyer in respect of such trade accounts
payable constituting IVA; provided that in the event that the Reduction
Amount exceeds the amount of the IVA and IEPS collected or received by Buyer
in respect of any Purchased Receivable, Parent, on behalf of Sellers, shall
remit such excess to Buyer within 5 days of receipt of the summary described
in the following sentence. A summary of the calculation of such IVA and IEPS
payments payable to Sellers and the Reduction Amounts shall be set forth in
the monthly summaries provided in accordance with Section 8.17(b).   ARTICLE

IX.   Section 9.2 INDEMNIFICATION OF BUYER. (a) Subject to the
limitations contained in this Article IX, Sellers and the Additional Seller
Parties will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and any of its
Affiliates and Buyer\'s and Buyer\'s Affiliates\' directors, officers,
employees, successors and assigns (each, a "BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from
and against any and all losses, liabilities, and damages, costs and expenses
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) (hereinafter
individually, a "LOSS" and collectively, "LOSSES") which arise out of, or
result from, or relate to (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of Sellers contained in this Agreement or in
the certificate delivered by any Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(e) (which
representations and warranties for purposes of this Section 9.2 shall be read
as though none of them contained any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifier or exception), or (ii) any Excluded Liability. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) neither of the Romo de la
Pena Brothers will have any obligations or liability under this Section 9.2
unless and until all other Sellers shall have failed to make any payments
otherwise required under this Section 9.2; and (ii) subject to clause (i) of
this sentence, the Romo de la Pena Brothers will be severally (not jointly
and severally) liable for any payments required under this Section 9.2, but
the maximum liability of each of the Romo de la Pena   -53-    Brothers
will not exceed 50% of the aggregate amounts required to be paid under this
Section 9.2. In addition, without affecting or limiting Buyer\'s
obligations under or as a result of Section 8.10 or Section 9.3(a), the
Sellers agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses and claims relating
to any Business Employee as a result of or in connection with any act or
omission of the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers occurring before the
Closing.   (b) No claim may be made against Sellers or the Additional
Seller Parties for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) with respect
to any individual item of Loss arising from a breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty of Sellers ("SELLERS WARRANTY BREACHES") in
this Agreement, unless the aggregate of all Losses of Buyer Indemnified
Parties with respect to all such breaches and inaccuracies exceeds 0.5% of
the Final Purchase Price and then, in any case, only to the extent of such
excess. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in no event will Sellers\' and
Additional Seller Parties\' aggregate liability under Section 9.2(a)(i)
exceed $100,000,000.00; (ii) none of the limitations set forth in this
Section 9.2(b) shall apply to or otherwise limit the Buyer Indemnified
Parties\' right to indemnification for all Losses arising out of, or
resulting from, or relating to any breach or inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.2, Section 4.3
or Section 4.8; and (iii) for purposes of (A) determining whether Losses
relating to Sellers Warranty Breaches exceed 0.5% of the Final Purchase Price
and (B) calculating Losses for which Sellers and Additional Seller Parties
are liable under Section 9.2(a)(i), Sellers and Additional Seller Parties
will not have any liability for such Losses unless the aggregate amount of
such Losses relating to a single claim (or group of claims relating to the
same or similar event, fact or circumstance) exceeds $25,000.   (c) If a
Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the Sellers and
the Additional Seller Parties hereunder for any Losses, such indemnification
obligations of the Sellers will be satisfied first from the Escrowed Funds
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and, after any such Escrowed Funds are
released from escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or otherwise claimed
against hereunder, by Sellers and the Additional Seller Parties, subject to
the limitations contained herein; provided, however, that with respect to
any Loss that arises out of, or results from, or relates to any Excluded Tax
Matter, the Buyer Indemnified Parties may, but shall not be required to,
first satisfy such indemnifiable Loss from the Escrowed Funds pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement and may proceed against the Sellers and the Additional
Seller Parties in respect thereof, subject to the limitations contained
herein.   (d) Each Buyer Indemnified Party will give Sellers prompt
written notice of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding (collectively, a
"BUYER CLAIM") by or in respect of a third party of which such Buyer
Indemnified Party has knowledge concerning any Loss as to which such Buyer
Indemnified Party may request indemnification hereunder. Any delay in the
giving of such notice will not relieve the Sellers of their indemnification
obligations under Section 9.2(a) except to the extent that the Sellers are
actually damaged as a result of such delay. Sellers will have the right to
direct, through counsel of their own choosing, the defense or settlement of
any such Buyer Claim at its own expense. If Sellers elect to assume the
defense of any such   -54-    Buyer Claim, such Buyer Indemnified Party
may participate in such defense, but in such case the expenses of such Buyer
Indemnified Party will be paid by such Buyer Indemnified Party. If and to the
extent reasonably requested by Sellers, such Buyer Indemnified Party will
provide Sellers with access to its records and personnel relating to any such
Buyer Claim during normal business hours and will otherwise cooperate with
Sellers in the defense or settlement thereof, and Sellers will reimburse such
Buyer Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
connection therewith. If Sellers elect to direct the defense of any such
Buyer Claim, (i) such Buyer Indemnified Party will not pay, or permit to be
paid, any part of any Loss claimed by the third party claimant in respect of
such Buyer Claim, unless (1) Sellers consent in advance in writing to such
payment (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), (2) Sellers, subject to the last sentence of this Section
9.2y(d), withdraw from the defense of such asserted liability or (3) the
Buyer Indemnified Party is so ordered or directed by a Governmental Authority
or arbitral authority (which order or direction is not stayed) or a final
judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of Sellers is
entered against the Buyer Indemnified Party for such Loss and (ii) Sellers
will not enter into any settlement or compromise of such Buyer Claim that
does not include as a unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant
or plaintiff to the Buyer Indemnified Parties a full release of all liability
with respect to the subject matter of the Buyer Claim or that involves any
term or condition applicable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties other than the
payment of money by Sellers, in each case, without the prior written consent
of Buyer. If Sellers fail to defend any Buyer Claim, or if, after commencing
or undertaking any such defense, fail to prosecute or withdraws from such
defense, such Buyer Indemnified Party will have the right to undertake the
defense or settlement thereof, at Sellers\' expense. If such Buyer
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of such Buyer Claim pursuant to this
Section 9.2y(c) and proposes to settle such Buyer Claim prior to a final
judgment thereof or to forego appeal with respect thereto, then such Buyer
Indemnified Party will give Sellers prompt written notice thereof and Sellers
will have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume
the defense of such Buyer Claim. The foregoing provisions of this Section
9.2(d) will not apply to Tax Matters, which shall instead be governed
by Section 8.3(d).   Section 9.3 INDEMNIFICATION OF SELLERS. (a) Subject to
the limitations contained in this Article IX, Buyer agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Sellers and any of their Affiliates, and its and its
Affiliates\' directors, officers, employees, successors and assigns (each, a
"SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any and all Losses which arise
out of, or result from, or relate to (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this
Agreement or in the officer\'s certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to
Section 7.2(e) (which representations and warranties for purposes of this
Section 9.3 shall be read as though none of them contained any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifier or exception), (ii) any Assumed Liability,
(iii) Liabilities incurred by Buyer resulting from the operation of the
Business on and after the Closing Date, (iv) claims relating to any Owned
Real Property arising on and after the Closing Date or (v) claims made by any
other party to a Real Property Lease on and after the Closing Date, in each
case, in the case of clauses (iii) - (v), to the extent such Liabilities and
claims would otherwise constitute an Assumed Liability hereunder. In
addition, Buyer agrees to indemnify,   -55-    defend and hold harmless
each of the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses
and claims relating to any Business Employee as a result of or in connection
with any act or omission of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer occurring on or
after the Closing.   (b) No claim may be made against Buyer for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i) with respect to any individual
item of Loss arising from a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement, unless the aggregate of all Losses of the Seller
Indemnified Parties with respect such breaches exceeds 0.5% of the Final
Purchase Price and then only to the extent of such excess, and in no event
will Buyer\'s aggregate liability for such breaches and inaccuracies exceed
$100,000,000.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the limitations set
forth in this Section 9.3(b) shall apply to or otherwise limit the Seller
Indemnified Parties\' right to indemnification for all Losses arising out of,
or resulting from, or relating to any breach or inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.2. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, for purposes of determining whether Losses for which
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i) is available exceed 0.5% of the
Final Purchase Price, Buyer will not have any liability for such Losses
unless the aggregate amount of such Losses relating to a single claim (or
group of claims relating to the same or similar event, fact or circumstance)
exceeds $25,000.   (c) Each Seller Indemnified Party will give Buyer prompt
written notice of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding (collectively, a
"SELLER CLAIM") by or in respect of a third party of which such Seller
Indemnified Party has knowledge concerning any Loss as to which such Seller
Indemnified Party may request indemnification hereunder. Any delay in the
giving of such notice will not relieve Buyer of its indemnification
obligations under Section 9.3(a) except to the extent that Buyer is actually
damaged as a result of such delay. Buyer will have the right to direct,
through counsel of its own choosing, the defense or settlement of any such
Seller Claim at its own expense. If Buyer elects to assume the defense of any
such Seller Claim, such Seller Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense, but in such case the expenses of such Seller Indemnified Party will
be paid by such Seller Indemnified Party. If and to the extent reasonably
requested by Buyer, such Seller Indemnified Party will provide Buyer with
access to its records and personnel relating to any such Seller Claim during
normal business hours and will otherwise cooperate with Buyer in the defense
or settlement thereof, and Buyer will reimburse such Seller Indemnified Party
for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith.
If Buyer elects to direct the defense of any such Seller Claim, (i) such
Seller Indemnified Party will not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any
Loss claimed by the third party claimant in respect of such Seller Claim,
unless (1) Buyer consents in advance in writing to such payment (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (2)
Buyer, subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.2y(c), withdraws from
the defense of such asserted liability or (3) the Seller Indemnified Party is
so ordered or directed by a Governmental Authority or arbitral authority
(which order or direction is not stayed) or a final judgment from which no
appeal may be taken by or on behalf of Buyer is entered against the Seller
Indemnified Party for such Loss and (ii) Buyer will not enter into any
settlement or compromise of such Seller Claim that does not include as a
unconditional   -56-    term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to the Seller Indemnified Parties a full release of all liability
with respect to the subject matter of the Seller Claim or that involves any
term or condition applicable to the Seller Indemnified Parties other than the
payment of money by Buyer, without the prior written consent of Parent. If
Buyer fails to defend any Seller Claim, or if, after commencing or
undertaking any such defense, fails to prosecute or withdraws from such
defense, such Seller Indemnified Party will have the right to undertake the
defense or settlement thereof, at Buyer\'s expense. If such Seller
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any such Seller Claim and proposes
to settle such Seller Claim prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego
appeal with respect thereto, then such Seller Indemnified Party will
give Buyer prompt written notice thereof and Buyer will have the right to
participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such
Seller Claim. The foregoing provisions of this Section 9.3(c) will not apply
to Tax Matters, which shall instead be governed by Section 8.3(d).  
Section 9.4 TAX BENEFIT; INSURED LOSS. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, in the event any claim pursuant
to this Article IX is an insured loss to the indemnified Person, the
indemnifying Person will be entitled to a credit against any liability
thereunder in the net amount of and to the extent of any insurance proceeds
to which the indemnified Person shall have actually received. If an
indemnified Person receives payment required by this Agreement from any
indemnifying Person in respect of an indemnifiable Loss and subsequently
receives insurance proceeds in reduction of such indemnifiable Loss, then the
indemnified Person will promptly pay to the indemnifying Person an amount
equal to the excess of the indemnity payment received from such indemnified
Person in respect of such indemnifiable Loss over the amount of the indemnity
payment that would have been due if the insurance proceeds had be actually
received prior to such indemnity payment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, any amounts payable by the
indemnifying Person to or on behalf of an indemnified Person pursuant to this
Article IX will be (i) increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred
by the indemnified Person arising from the receipt of indemnity payments
hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of
any net Tax benefit realized by the indemnified Person arising from the
incurrence or payment of any such Loss, in each case when and as such Tax
cost or benefit is actually realized through an increase or reduction
of Taxes otherwise due.   Section 9.5 DAMAGES LIMITATIONS. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, none of Sellers or Buyer will be permitted
to recover any consequential, indirect or punitive damages arising out of or
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
regardless of the form of the claim, including claims for indemnification,
tort, breach of contract, warranty, representation or covenant, unless, and
then only to the extent, such damages (a) arise out of or result from any
common law fraud by the indemnifying Person or (b) are awarded in an action
involving a third party claim against the party to this Agreement that is
seeking recovery for such damages.   Section 9.6 EXCLUSIVE PROVISIONS; NO
RESCISSION. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or in any
Ancillary Agreement, none of Buyer and the Sellers   -57-    is making
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to the
matters contained herein. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein will give rise to any right on the part of Buyer or any
Seller, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Assets
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby except in the event of fraud.   Section 9.7 EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY. Except as provided in any Ancillary Agreement, Section 10.2 and
Section 11.5, and except for the right to seek specific performance of the
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and except for fraud or
willful breach of this Agreement, the indemnification rights under this
Article IX will be the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto with respect to
any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement.   ARTICLE X

information for purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated by or
the performance of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, BFC may file this Agreement and disclose the transactions
contemplated hereby publicly with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
without the requirement of any consent hereunder.   Section 11.6 ENTIRE
AGREEMENT. The Confidentiality Agreement and this Agreement (including the
Exhibits and Schedules) and the agreements, certificates and  
-74-    other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement (including
the Ancillary Agreements) contain the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the transactions described herein, and supersede all prior
agreements, written or oral, with respect thereto.   Section 11.7 WAIVERS
AND AMENDMENTS. This Agreement may be amended, superseded, cancelled, renewed
or extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument
signed by the parties hereto or, in the case of a waiver, by the party
waiving compliance. No delay on the part of any party in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof.  
Section 11.8 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of New York without regard to principles of
conflicts of law.   Section 11.9 ARBITRATION. In the event any dispute
("DISPUTE") arises regarding or pertaining to the validity, intention or
interpretation, execution or compliance of this Agreement, the parties to
this Agreement will, in good faith, use their reasonable best efforts to
settle such Dispute. If, within the 60 calendar days following the date in
which one of the parties gives notice to the other of the existence of a
Dispute, such Dispute has not been finally resolved in writing to the mutual
satisfaction of the parties to this Agreement, each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to submit such Dispute, for
itself and its property, to be fully and finally resolved by arbitration.
Such arbitration shall be conducted in Manhattan, in New York, New York, in
English language, pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the International
Chamber of Commerce then in effect (the "ICC RULES") by a panel of three
arbitrators, one designated by Sellers, one designated by Buyer, and the
third, who shall act as chairman, designated by the other two arbitrators so
appointed. In the event that the first two arbitrators fail to appoint the
third arbitrator within 30 days after their selection, such third arbitrator
shall be appointed pursuant to the ICC Rules. The arbitration panel shall, in
respect of any Dispute submitted thereto grant an award, strictly grounded in
law, not later than the end of the 9th calendar month after the month in
which such Dispute is submitted to arbitration. The award of the arbitration
panel will be final and binding on the parties to this Agreement and such
award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction for its
enforcement, and the parties to this Agreement hereby expressly submit to the
jurisdiction of said court. The fees and expenses of the arbitration panel
shall be borne equally by the parties to this Agreement; provided, however,
each such party shall be solely responsible for all fees and expenses of
counsel retained by such party in connection with any such arbitration.  
Section 11.10 BINDING EFFECT; NO ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement will be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors,
permitted assignees and legal representatives. Except as expressly set forth
in Article IX, this Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon
any Person not a party hereto (other than successors, legal representatives
and permitted assigns of parties hereto) any rights or remedies hereunder.
This Agreement (or any right hereunder) is not assignable by any party hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties   -75-    hereto
and any such purported assignment without such consent will be null and void,
except that either or both of Buyer and BFC may assign all or any part of its
benefits and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Subsidiaries
of Buyer or BFC (provided that any such assignment shall not relieve Buyer or
BFC of any of its obligations hereunder).   Section 11.11 CERTAIN
INTERPRETATION MATTERS. All pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the
masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the context may
require. Except as otherwise provided herein, all payments required to be
made under or pursuant to this Agreement will be made in United States
dollars and all references to amounts herein will be to United States
dollars. The Exhibits and Schedules are a part of this Agreement as if fully
set forth herein. All references herein to Sections, subsections,
clauses, Exhibits and Schedules will be deemed references to such parts of
this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The headings in this
Agreement are for reference only, and will not affect the interpretation of
this Agreement. The term "including" means "including without
limitation."   Section 11.12 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by
the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed
and delivered will be an original, but all such counterparts will
together constitute one and the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist
of a number of copies, facsimiles or facsimiles of copies hereof each signed
by less than all, but together signed by all of the parties hereto.  
Section 11.13 SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision or any portion of
any provision of this Agreement or the application of such provision or any
portion thereof to any Person or circumstance, is held invalid
or unenforceable, the remaining portion of such provision and the
remaining provisions of this Agreement, or the application of such provision
or portion of such provision as is held invalid or unenforceable to persons
or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or
unenforceable, will not be affected thereby.   Section 11.14 GUARANTEE OF
PERFORMANCE. (a) BFC hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to
Sellers the prompt and full discharge by Buyer of all of Buyer\'s covenants,
agreements, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement including the
due and punctual payment of all amounts which are or may become due and
payable by Buyer or any of its permitted assignees or designees hereunder
(such assignees and designees together with Buyer for purposes of
this Section 11.14, the "BUYER PARTIES"), when and as the same shall become
due and payable (collectively, the "BUYER OBLIGATIONS"), in accordance with
the terms hereof. BFC acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to all Buyer
Obligations to pay money, such guaranty shall be a guaranty of payment and
performance and not of collection and shall not be conditioned or contingent
upon the pursuit of any remedies against any Buyer Party. If any Buyer Party
shall default in the due and punctual performance of any Buyer Obligation,
including the full and timely payment of any amount due and payable pursuant
to any Buyer Obligation, BFC will forthwith perform or cause to be performed
such Buyer Obligation and will forthwith make full payment of any amount due
with   -76-    respect thereto at its sole cost and expense. This
Section 11.14(a) shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon
and after the date that the Buyer Obligations shall have been paid or
performed in full.   (b) Subject to Section 11.14(g), liabilities and
obligations of BFC pursuant to Section 11.14(a) are unconditional and
absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be
released, discharged or otherwise affected by:   (i) any acceleration,
extension, renewal, settlement,  compromise, waiver or release in respect of
any Buyer Obligation by  operation of law or otherwise;   (ii) any
modification or amendment of or supplement to this  Agreement entered into in
accordance with its terms;   (iii) any change in the existence, structure or
ownership of any  Buyer Party or BFC or any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other  similar proceeding affecting any of them or their
assets; or   (iv) any other act, omission to act, delay of any kind by any 
party hereto or any other Person, or any other circumstance whatsoever that 
might, but for the provisions of this Section 11.14, constitute a legal or 
equitable discharge of the obligations of BFC, as guarantor to the extent 
set forth hereunder.   (c) BFC hereby waives any right, whether legal or
equitable, statutory or non-statutory, to require any Seller to proceed
against or take any action against or pursue any remedy with respect to any
Buyer Party or any other Person or make presentment or demand for performance
or give any notice of nonperformance before any party hereto may enforce its
rights hereunder against BFC as guarantor.   (d) The obligations of BFC as
BFC to the extent set forth hereunder shall remain in full force and effect
until the Buyer Obligations shall have been paid or performed in full. If at
any time any performance by any Person of any Buyer Obligation is rescinded
or must be otherwise restored or returned, whether upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any Buyer Party or otherwise, BFC\'s
obligations hereunder with respect to such Buyer Obligation shall be
reinstated at that time as though that Buyer Obligation had become due and
had not been performed.   (e) Upon payment or performance by BFC of any
Buyer Obligation, BFC shall be subrogated to the rights of Seller against
such Buyer Party with respect to that Buyer Obligation.   (f) The
obligations of BFC under this Section 11.14 shall be limited to an aggregate
amount that is equal to the largest amount that would not render its
obligations under this Section 11.14 subject to avoidance under Section
548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of
any applicable state law.   -77-     (g) Notwithstanding anything
expressed or implied herein to the contrary, BFC shall be entitled to assert
any and all defenses to payment or performance of any Buyer Obligation that
could be asserted by any Buyer Party.    * * * * *   -78-     IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby,
have duly executed this Agreement on the date first above written.
