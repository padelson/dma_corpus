**_SECURITIES  PURCHASE AGREEMENT_**

 

 

THIS  SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (" _Agreement_ ")  is  entered into as
of the 6th day of February, 2006, among PLY GEM INDUSTRIES,  INC., a Delaware
corporation (" _Buyer_ "),  each  of the Persons identified in Section 4.2.1
of the Disclosure Letter (each,  a " _Seller_ ," and  collectively, "
_Sellers_ "),  each  of the Persons identified on _Exhibit A_  (each, a "
_Beneficial  Seller_ ," and  collectively, " _Beneficial  Sellers_ "), 
and  on its own behalf, and on behalf of each Seller and Beneficial Seller,
FNL  Management Corp., an Ohio corporation (" _Sellers '  Representative_").

 

 

_RECITALS_ :

 

 

1. Sellers  own (i) all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (as more  particularly defined in Section 4.2.1, the " _Shares_ ")  of AWC  Holding Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ ");  (ii) all of the issued and outstanding options to purchase shares of  capital stock of Parent (as more particularly defined in Section 4.2.1, the " _Stock  Options_ ");  and  (iii) all of the issued and outstanding warrants to purchase shares of  capital stock of Parent (as more particularly defined in Section 4.2.1, the " _Warrants_ " and,  together with the Shares and the Stock Options, collectively referred to herein  as the " _Securities_ ").

 

 

2. Parent  owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Alenco Holding  Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Alenco_ ").

 

 

3. Alenco,  either directly, or indirectly through one of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries,  owns all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the Alenco  Subsidiaries.

 

 

4. Buyer  shall purchase from Sellers, and Sellers shall sell to Buyer, the Securities  (other than the Rollover Shares) upon and subject to the terms and conditions  set forth in this Agreement (the " _Securities  Purchase_ ").

 

 

5. Beneficial  Sellers own all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of AWC  Investment, LLC (a Seller) and will therefore benefit from the Securities  Purchase.

 

 

6. Concurrently  with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition to the willingness  of  Buyer to enter into this Agreement, certain Sellers are entering into executive  participation agreements with Ply Gem Investment Holdings, Inc. relating to  the contribution by such Sellers of the Rollover Shares to a new parent company  of Ply Gem Investment Holdings, Inc. (the " _Rollover  Buyer_ ")  simultaneously with the Closing (collectively, the " _Participation  Agreements_ ").  

 

 

Now,  therefore, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants  and agreements set forth in this Agreement, Buyer, Sellers,
Beneficial Sellers  and Sellers' Representative hereby agree as follows:

 

 

**ARTICLE  1**

2.1 _Purchase  and Sale_.

 

 

Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing each
Seller shall  sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, free and clear of
all Liens, and  Buyer shall purchase from each Seller, all of such Seller's
right, title and  interest in and to all of the Securities (other than the
Rollover Shares) owned  by such Seller, as more specifically identified in
Section 4.2.1 of the  Disclosure Letter (as to each Seller, respectively, the
" _Seller 's  Respective Securities_").

 

 

2.2 _Purchase  Price_.

 

 

The  aggregate purchase price for all of the Securities (other than the
Rollover  Shares) (the " _Purchase  Price_ ")  shall  be an amount equal
to:

 

 

(a) One  Hundred Twenty Million Dollars ($120,000,000);

 

 

(b) _plus_   an  amount equal to the Closing Cash;

 

 

(c) _minus_   an  amount equal to the Closing Indebtedness;

 

 

(d) _minus_   an  amount equal to the Value of the Rollover Shares;

 

 

(e) _plus_   the  amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital
exceeds the Working Capital  Target, or _minus_   the  amount, if any, by
which the Working Capital Target exceeds the Closing Working  Capital;

 

 

(f) _plus_   an  amount equal to the Tax Benefit Amount calculated and
payable in accordance  with  Section 8.4 hereof; and

 

 

(g) _minus_   the  amount of any Transaction Bonuses not paid prior to the
Closing  Date.

 

 

2.3 _Certain  Definitions_.

 

 

2.3.1 _Working  Capital_.

 

 

" _Working  Capital_ " of  the  Acquired Companies is defined in Section
2.3.1 of the Disclosure Letter,  and shall be calculated in accordance with
GAAP, except to the extent GAAP  may  be modified by Section 2.3.1 of the
Disclosure Letter. Any additional  accounts opened or closed in the general
ledgers of the Acquired Companies  after  the date hereof with respect to
any category of asset or liability included  in  Section 2.3.1 of the
Disclosure Letter shall be included or excluded in the  calculation of
Working Capital consistent with the calculation set forth in  Section 2.3.1
of the Disclosure Letter.

 

 

2.3.2 _Closing  Working Capital_.

 

 

" _Closing  Working Capital_ " means  the Working Capital of the Acquired
Companies, on a consolidated basis, as  of  immediately prior to the
Closing.

 

 

2.3.3 _Working  Capital Target_.

 

 

" _Working  Capital Target_ " means  Six Million Four Hundred Sixty Five
Thousand Six Hundred Fifty Two Dollars  ($6,465,652).

 

 

2.4 _Estimated  Purchase Price; Payment of Indebtedness_.

 

 

2.4.1 _Estimated  Purchase Price_. 

 

 

On  the  second Business Day before the Closing Date, Sellers'
Representative, on behalf  of all Sellers and Beneficial Sellers, shall
estimate in good faith (in  consultation with Buyer) the amount of the
Closing Cash, the Closing  Indebtedness and the Closing Working Capital,
respectively, and deliver to  Buyer  a certificate setting forth such
estimates (the " _Closing  Certificate_ "),  which  Closing Certificate
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and prepared  in  the same manner
that the Preliminary Adjustment Statement is required to be  prepared
pursuant to Section 2.5.1. Such estimates shall be based on the  most recent
ascertainable financial information of the Acquired Companies,  with  such
adjustments thereto as are reasonably appropriate to reflect any changes 
which are known to Sellers' Representative to have occurred subsequent to
the  date of such financial information or which, in the reasonable judgment
of  Sellers' Representative, will occur prior to the Closing. As used
herein, " _Estimated  Closing Cash_ ,"  " _Estimated  Closing
Indebtedness_ " and  " _Estimated  Closing Working Capital_ " mean  the
estimates of the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing 
Working Capital, respectively, set forth in the Closing Certificate, and "
_Estimated  Purchase Price_ " means  an amount equal to the Purchase Price
calculated as set forth in  Section 2.2 (excluding  the Tax Benefit Amount
which shall be calculated pursuant to, and payable in  accordance with,
Section 8.4 hereof), assuming for purposes of such  calculation that the
Closing Cash is equal to the Estimated Closing Cash, that  the Closing
Indebtedness is equal to the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and  that  the
Closing Working Capital is equal to the Estimated Closing Working Capital. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer 
shall (a) pay and deliver the Estimated Purchase Price (as calculated based 
upon the Closing Certificate) _less_   the  Escrowed Funds (the " _Closing 
Date Payment_ ")  to  Sellers by means of a wire transfer of immediately
available cash funds to  an  account as directed by Sellers' Representative
prior to the Closing (the " _Sellers '  Account_");  (b) pay the Escrowed
Funds to the Escrow Agent; and (c) cause the Rollover  Buyer to deliver to
each Seller that has contributed Rollover Shares, to the  extent of such
contribution, an equivalent value of shares of capital stock  of  the
Rollover Buyer in accordance with the Participation Agreements.

 

 

2.4.2 _Payment  of Indebtedness_. 

 

 

Buyer  will pay, or cause to be paid, in full at or immediately following
the  transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Indebtedness of the
Acquired  Companies identified in Section 2.4.2 of the Disclosure Letter 
(collectively, the " _Repaid  Closing Indebtedness_ ").  In  order to
facilitate such repayment, as soon as practicable and in no event  later 
than two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date, Sellers' Representative 
shall cause the Acquired Companies to obtain payoff letters for the
repayment  of  such Indebtedness, which payoff letters will be in a
commercially reasonable  form and shall indicate that such lenders shall
release simultaneously with  such  repayment all applicable Liens relating
to the assets and properties of the  Acquired Companies, including the
redelivery of all stock certificates held  pursuant to any such terminated
stock pledge agreements (collectively, the  " _Pay-Off  Documents_ "). 

 

 

2.5 _Post-Closing  Adjustment_.

 

 

2.5.1 _Adjustment  Statement Preparation_. 

 

 

Within  sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the
Acquired Companies  to prepare and deliver to Sellers' Representative an
adjustment statement  setting forth the amount of the Closing Cash, the
Closing Indebtedness and  the  Closing Working Capital of the Acquired
Companies, on a consolidated basis,  respectively, as of immediately prior to
the Closing (the " _Preliminary  Adjustment Statement_ ")  and,  based on
the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Working  Capital
as derived therefrom, Buyer's written calculation of the Purchase Price 
(excluding the Tax Benefit Amount which shall be calculated pursuant to, and 
payable in accordance with, Section 8.4), and the adjustment necessary to 
reconcile the Estimated Purchase Price to the Purchase Price (excluding the 
Tax  Benefit Amount which shall be calculated pursuant to, and payable in
accordance  with, Section 8.4) (the " _Preliminary  Post-Closing Adjustment_
").  The  Preliminary Adjustment Statement and Final Adjustment Statement
shall be  prepared in a manner consistent with and using the same accounting
methods,  policies, practices and procedures as used in the preparation of
the Audited  Financial Statements, consistently applied in conformity with
GAAP except for  those matters described in Section 4.5(a) of the Disclosure
Letter, and in  accordance with Section 2.3.1 of the Disclosure Letter and
the definitions  in  Article 11 and Section 2.3 hereof, _except_   that
the  Preliminary Adjustment Statement and Final Adjustment Statement shall
only  reflect those assets and liabilities of the Acquired Companies
necessary to  calculate the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and
Closing Working  Capital. In preparing the Preliminary Adjustment Statement:
(a) any and all  effects on the assets or liabilities of any of the Acquired
Companies of any  financing or refinancing arrangements entered into by Buyer
at any time at  or  after the Closing Date shall be entirely disregarded,
other than the interest,  premium, penalties and other amounts owing in
respect of the Closing  Indebtedness, which shall be taken into account; (b)
it shall be assumed that  the Acquired Companies and their respective lines
of business shall be continued  as a going concern; (c) there shall not be
taken into account any of the  plans, transactions or changes that Buyer
intends to initiate or make or cause  to be initiated or made at or after the
Closing Date with respect to any of  the  Acquired Companies or its
respective business or assets, or any facts or  circumstances that are unique
or particular to Buyer or any assets or  liabilities of Buyer, or any
obligation for the payment of the Purchase Price  hereunder; (d) the portion
of any prepaid asset for which the underlying value  is no longer useful to
any of the Acquired Companies following the consummation  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be disregarded; and  (e)  fees and
expenses incident to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  shall
be handled in accordance with Section 8.2.2.

 

 

2.5.2 _Adjustment  Statement Review_. 

 

 

Sellers'  Representative, on behalf of all Sellers, shall review the
Preliminary  Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment
and, if  Sellers' Representative reasonably believes that either was not
prepared in  accordance with Section 2.5.1, Sellers' Representative shall so
notify  Buyer in writing no later than the thirtieth (30) day after
Sellers' Representative receipt thereof, setting forth in such notice
Sellers' Representative objection or objections to the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement  or the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment with particularity and
the specific  changes or adjustments which Sellers' Representative claims are
required to be  made thereto in order to conform the same to the terms of
Section 2.5.1.  Any notice of objection delivered pursuant to this Section
2.5.2 shall  specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so
asserted. Buyer  shall cause the Acquired Companies to reasonably cooperate
with all  representatives of Sellers (including Sellers' Representative) in
the review of  the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and, without limiting the
generality of  the  foregoing, shall cause the books and records of the
Acquired Companies to be  made available during normal business hours to such
representatives, and shall  cause the necessary personnel of the Acquired
Companies to assist such  representatives in their review of the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement,  including granting such persons access to the
facilities and other assets of  the  Acquired Companies, in each case, upon
reasonable advance notice; _provided_ ,  that  none of the foregoing
unreasonably interferes with the normal business  operations of Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Acquired  Companies).

 

 

2.5.3 _Adjustment  Statement Dispute Resolution_. 

 

 

If  Sellers' Representative timely notifies Buyer in accordance with 
Section 2.5.2 of an objection to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement or  the
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, and if Buyer and Sellers' Representative
are unable to resolve such dispute through good faith  negotiations within
fifteen (15) days after Sellers' Representative's delivery  of such written
notice of objection, then, the parties shall mutually engage  and  submit
such dispute to, and the same shall be finally resolved in accordance  with
the provisions of this Agreement by an accounting firm of national 
reputation as shall be mutually acceptable to Buyer and Sellers'
Representative  (the " _Independent  Accountants_ ").  Buyer  and Sellers'
Representative shall have the opportunity to present their  positions with
respect to such disputed matters to the Independent Accountants  in
accordance with the requirements of Section 2.5. The Independent  Accountants
shall determine and report in writing to Buyer and Sellers' Representative as
to the resolution of all disputed matters submitted to the  Independent
Accountants and the effect of such determinations on the Preliminary 
Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment within
twenty  (20) days after such submission or such longer period as the
Independent  Accountants may reasonably require, and such determinations
shall be final,  binding and conclusive as to Buyer, Sellers, Sellers'
Representative and their  respective Affiliates; _provided_   that no  such
determination shall result in adjustments to any items not in dispute  and 
no adjustments shall be greater than claimed in any dispute by
Sellers' Representative. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accountants shall  be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers,
collectively, on  the  other hand, such that Sellers' share of such fees and
disbursements shall be in  the same proportion that the aggregate amount of
the disputed items and amounts  submitted by Sellers' Representative to the
Independent Accountants that are  unsuccessfully disputed by Sellers'
Representative (as finally determined by the  Independent Accountants) bears
to the total amount of such disputed items and  amounts so submitted by
Sellers' Representative to the Independent  Accountants.

 

 

2.5.4 _Final  Adjustment Statement and Post-Closing Adjustment_. 

 

 

The  Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing
Adjustment  shall become the " _Final  Adjustment Statement_ " and  the "
_Final  Post-Closing Adjustment_ ,"  respectively, and as such shall become
final, binding and conclusive upon Buyer,  Sellers, Sellers' Representative
and their respective Affiliates for all  purposes of this Agreement, upon the
earliest to occur of the  following:

 

 

(a) the  mutual acceptance by Buyer and Sellers' Representative of the
Preliminary  Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-Closing
Adjustment, respectively,  with such changes or adjustments thereto, if any,
as may be proposed by Sellers' Representative and consented to by Buyer;

 

 

(b) the  expiration of thirty (30) days after Sellers' Representative's
receipt of the  Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Preliminary Post-
Closing Adjustment,  respectively, without timely written objection thereto
by Sellers' Representative in accordance with Section 2.5.2; or

 

 

(c) the  delivery to Buyer and Sellers' Representative by the Independent
Accountants of  the report of their determination of all disputed matters
submitted to them  pursuant to Section 2.5.3.

 

 

2.5.5 _Adjustment  of Purchase Price_. 

 

 

If  the  Purchase Price (excluding the Tax Benefit Amount which shall be
calculated  pursuant to, and payable in accordance with, Section 8.4), as
finally  determined in accordance with this Section 2.5, is greater than
the  Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer shall pay the amount of such
difference  to  Sellers' Representative for the benefit of Sellers by means
of a wire transfer  of immediately available funds to Sellers' Account. If
the Purchase Price, as  finally determined in accordance with this Section
2.5, is less than the  Estimated Purchase Price, Sellers shall be
responsible, on a several basis,  to  pay the amount of such difference to
Buyer by means of a wire transfer of  immediately available funds to an
account designated by Buyer; _provided_ ,  that in  lieu of requiring such
payments from any Seller, Buyer may (but shall not be  obligated to) proceed
directly against the Escrowed Funds for all or any portion  of such
difference payable by such Seller. The Final Post-Closing Adjustment,  if 
any, shall be due and payable pursuant to this Section 2.5.5 no later than 
two (2) Business Days after the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the 
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment become the Final Adjustment Statement
and  the Final Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, pursuant to Section
2.5.4.  For Tax purposes, any payment by Buyer, Sellers or Beneficial Sellers
under  this  Agreement, including pursuant to Section 8.4 and Article 9,
shall be  treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless a contrary
treatment  is  required by Law.

 

 

2.6 _Allocation  to Sellers and Beneficial Sellers of the Purchase Price_.

 

 

The  payment by Buyer of the Purchase Price (including any additional amount
required  pursuant to Section 2.5.5) into Sellers' Account shall constitute
payment  by Buyer to each Seller and Beneficial Seller and satisfaction of
Buyer's  obligation to pay such amount hereunder. After such payment by
Buyer, Sellers' Representative shall be solely responsible for allocating and
distributing  to  each Seller and Beneficial Seller such Seller's and
Beneficial Seller's  respective share of the Purchase Price from the Sellers'
Account. Any collective  obligations of Sellers, including payment of
transaction fees and expenses,  shall be allocated among Sellers and the
Beneficial Sellers in accordance with  Section 2.6(a) of the Disclosure
Letter. The Estimated Purchase Price shall  be  allocated to Sellers in
accordance with Section 2.6(b) of the Disclosure  Letter, which section shall
be amended by the parties to reflect the  distribution of the Rollover Shares
to the applicable Sellers prior to the  Closing. Any adjustment to the
Estimated Purchase Price, the payment of the  Tax  Benefit Amount and
disbursements to Sellers of the Escrowed Funds shall be  allocated to Sellers
in accordance with Section 2.6(c) of the Disclosure Letter.  The portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to each Seller (net of obligations  and any
reserves or holdbacks for indemnification obligations or otherwise 
established pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or by
Sellers' Representative in its sole discretion) shall be paid and distributed
to such  Seller and ultimately to such Beneficial Seller by means of a wire
transfer  of  immediately available funds to an account designated by such
Seller and  Beneficial Seller to Sellers' Representative prior to, on, or
after the Closing.  At the Closing, Sellers and Beneficial Sellers agree that
Sellers' Representative may withhold from the proceeds otherwise
distributable to each  Seller and Beneficial Seller hereunder, and pay, such
Seller's and Beneficial  Seller's pro-rata portion of any fees or expenses
incurred by or on behalf of  Sellers in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Nothing in  this  Section 2.6 is intended or shall be
construed to confer on any Seller or  Beneficial Seller any rights against
Buyer in respect of the portion of the  Purchase Price allocated to such
Seller or Beneficial Seller or the net proceeds  received after delivery of
same into Sellers' Account.

 

 

2.7 _Required  Withholding_.

 

 

Buyer  shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price the
applicable  Taxes it is required to deduct and withhold from such payment
under applicable  Laws. If Buyer so deducts or withholds any such amounts,
such amounts shall  be  timely paid by Buyer to the appropriate Taxing
Authority and shall be treated  for all purposes as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom Buyer  made  such deduction and withholding.

 

 

2.8 _Escrow_.

 

 

At  the  Closing, Buyer, Sellers' Representative and KeyBank, N.A. (the "
_Escrow  Agent_ ")  shall  enter into an escrow agreement, substantially in
the form of _Exhibit B_  hereto  (the " _Escrow  Agreement_ "),  pursuant
to which Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) of the Estimated Purchase  Price
(the " _Escrowed  Funds_ ")  shall  be deposited into escrow for the
purpose of securing any obligations of Sellers  or Beneficial Sellers, as the
case may be, under this Agreement.

(iii) Notwithstanding  anything else contained herein to the contrary, Buyer
shall not be required  to  make any payments to Sellers pursuant to this
Section 8.4 until the  aggregate Tax Benefit Amount exceeds the Tax Benefit
Deductible and thereafter  Sellers shall be entitled to amounts in excess of

**Indemnification**

 

 

9.1 _Indemnification  of Buyer_

 

 

.  From and  after the Closing and subject to Sections 9.2, 9.5 and 9.6,
each Seller and  Beneficial Seller shall, severally and not jointly,
indemnify, defend, hold  harmless, pay and reimburse Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and their respective  officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, Affiliates, control persons,  successors, assigns, consultants,
accountants, counsel and other advisors  (collectively, the " _Buyer 
Indemnitees_ "),  from  and against (a) any Losses or Taxes based upon,
arising out of or caused by  any  inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the
representations and warranties made  by  such Seller or Beneficial Seller in
Article 3 or by Sellers or Beneficial  Sellers in Article 4 or in any
certificate or instrument delivered by  Sellers, Beneficial Sellers or
Seller's Representative pursuant to this  Agreement, as of the date such
representation or warranty was made or as if  such  representation or
warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date; (b) any  Losses or Taxes
based upon, arising out of or caused by any breach or  nonperformance of any
covenant or obligation made or incurred by Sellers,  Beneficial Sellers or
Sellers' Representative herein; and (c) any Taxes that  Seller and Beneficial
Sellers covenant and agree that they are responsible  for  in Section
10.1(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the  representations
and warranties made in Article 3, each Seller and Beneficial  Seller is
responsible for only those representations and warranties made by  that 
Seller or Beneficial Seller, and no Seller or Beneficial Seller shall be 
obligated to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay or reimburse Buyer 
Indemnitees for Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by, any
inaccuracy  in, or breach of, any representation or warranty made by any
other Seller or  Beneficial Seller in Article 3. The Escrowed Funds shall be
available to satisfy  claims for indemnification of Losses by Buyer
Indemnitees hereunder, except  if  any such claim relates to a breach of a
representation or warranty in Article  3  hereof the Escrowed Funds shall be
available but only to the extent of the  applicable portion of the Escrowed
Funds attributable to the applicable Seller  or Beneficial Seller that was
found in breach of the representation or warranty  in Article 3 and, each
Seller and Beneficial Seller agrees that Buyer may  proceed directly (without
first proceeding against the Escrowed Funds) against  the applicable Seller
or Beneficial Seller for Losses based upon, arising out  of  or caused by,
any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or warranty  made by such
Seller or Beneficial Seller in Article 3. The indemnification 
responsibilities of any Seller or Beneficial Seller hereunder shall be
construed  as being several and in the percentage set forth in Section 2.6(a)
of the  Disclosure Letter. Any indemnifiable Loss hereunder created by any
act or  omission by Sellers' Representative as provided herein shall be
deemed to be a  Loss that is the several responsibility of Sellers and
Beneficial Sellers for  purposes of this Section 9.1. Sellers and Beneficial
Sellers do not make  and shall not be deemed to have made, nor is Buyer
relying upon, any  representation, warranty, covenant or obligation other
than those  representations, warranties, covenants and obligations that are
expressly set  forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding Buyer's right to
investigate the  affairs of the Acquired Companies or any knowledge of Buyer
or its Affiliates  or  representatives obtained through such investigation,
Buyer shall have the right  to rely fully on the representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations  of  Sellers, Beneficial Sellers and Sellers'
Representatives contained in this  Agreement (as qualified by the Disclosure
Letter) and any certificate or  instrument delivered by Sellers, Beneficial
Sellers or Sellers' Representative  pursuant to this Agreement (as qualified
by the Disclosure Letter).

 

 

9.2 _Limitations  on Indemnification of Buyer_.

 

 

Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement, the indemnification
of Buyer Indemnitees  provided for in this Agreement shall be subject to the
limitations and  conditions set forth in this Section 9.2.

 

 

(a) Any  claim  by a Buyer Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.1 shall be  required to be made by delivering notice to Sellers'
Representative no later  than the expiration of eighteen (18) months after
the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any claim for
indemnification based upon,  arising out of or caused by (A) any inaccuracy
in or breach of any  representation or warranty in Section 3.1 [Authority and
Capacity], Section  3.2  [Ownership of Securities], Section 3.3 [Execution
and Delivery; Enforceability],  Section 4.2 [Capital Stock] or Section 4.19
[Brokerage] or (B) a breach of  any covenant contained herein (except for the
covenants in Section 8.1  [Pre-Closing Covenants and Agreements] which shall
expire at the Closing (other  than the covenants in Section 8.1.7 and 8.1.9
which shall not expire and shall  survive the Closing) and for the covenants
described in clause (ii) below which  shall survive as provided in such
clause), may be made at any time subject  to  the limitations, if any,
contained in such sections; and (ii) any claim for  indemnification based
upon, arising out of or caused by (y) any inaccuracy  in or  breach of any
representation or warranty made in Section 4.7 [Taxes] or Section  4.9
[Employee Benefit Plans and  Other  Compensation Arrangements] or (z) any
covenant contained in Article 10 may  be  made at any time prior to thirty
(30) days after the expiration of the  applicable statute of limitations
(including valid extensions  thereof).

 

 

(b) Except  for claims for indemnification under Section 9.1 based upon,
arising out of  or  caused by (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty  in  Section 3.1 [Authority and Capacity],
Section 3.2 [Ownership of Securities],  Section 3.3 [Execution and Delivery;
Enforceability], Section 4.2 [Capital  Stock] or Section 4.19 [Brokerage] or
(ii) any breach of any covenant herein  (except for the covenants in Section
8.1 [Pre-Closing Covenants and Agreements]  which shall expire at the Closing
(other than the covenants in Section 8.1.7  and  8.1.9 which shall not
expire and shall survive the Closing)), Buyer Indemnitees  shall not be
entitled to indemnification until the aggregate amount of all  of  Buyer
Indemnitees' claims for indemnification exceeds the Indemnification 
Threshold and thereafter Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification  only for amounts in excess of the Indemnification
Threshold.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, in the case of claims for
indemnification with respect to (y)  any  inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty in Section 4.7 [Taxes]  or  Section 4.9 [Employee
Benefit Plans and  Other  Compensation Arrangements] or (z) any covenant
contained in Article 10, Buyer  Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification until the aggregate amount  of Buyer Indemnitees' claims for
indemnification with respect to Section 4.7  [Taxes], Section 4.9 [Employee
Benefit Plans and  Other  Compensation Arrangements] or Article 10 exceeds
the Taxes and ERISA Threshold  and thereafter Buyer Indemnitees shall be
entitled to indemnification only  for  amounts in excess of the Taxes and
ERISA Threshold. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the limitations set forth in
this Section 9.2(b) shall not apply  in  the event and to the extent that
any Buyer Indemnitee has an indemnification  claim for Taxes hereunder as a
result of a disallowance or reduction of any  Closing Deduction with respect
to which Buyer has made a payment to Sellers' Account pursuant to Section
8.4, _provided_ ,  that  the Tax Benefit Deductible shall apply and shall be
taken into consideration  to  the benefit of Sellers and Beneficial Sellers
in determining the amount of  any  Loss for any such claim.

 

 

(c) Except  for claims for indemnification under Section 9.1 based upon,
arising out of  or  caused by (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty  in  Section 3.1 [Authority and Capacity],
Section 3.2 [Ownership of Securities],  Section 3.3 [Execution and Delivery;
Enforceability], Section 4.2 [Capital  Stock] or Section 4.19 [Brokerage], or
(ii) any breach of any covenant herein  (other than the covenants provided
for in the following proviso), the maximum  indemnification amount to which
Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled under this  Agreement shall be Seven
Million Dollars ($7,000,000);  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  the  Buyer
Indemnitees expressly understand and agree that any Losses for claims 
relating to Taxes, including the covenants set forth in Article 10 and for 
the  covenants in Section 8.1 [Pre-Closing Covenants and Agreements] which
shall  expire at the Closing (except for the covenants in Section 8.1.7 and
8.1.9  which  shall not expire and shall survive the Closing) is included in
the foregoing  $7,000,000 cap amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
limitations set forth  in this Section 9.2(c) shall not apply in the event
and to the extent that  any  Buyer Indemnitee has an indemnification claim
for Taxes hereunder as a result  of  a disallowance or reduction of any
Closing Deduction with respect to which  Buyer  has made a payment to
Sellers' Account pursuant to Section 8.4,  _provided_ ,  that  the Tax
Benefit Deductible shall apply and shall be taken into consideration  to 
the benefit of Sellers and Beneficial Sellers in determining the amount of 
any  Loss for any such claim.

 

 

(d) For  purposes of determining the amount of any Loss arising from a breach
of or  inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of
Sellers,  Beneficial Sellers or Sellers' Representative in this Agreement but
not for  purposes of determining whether any such representation, warranty,
covenant  or  obligation has been breached or is inaccurate, limitations or
qualifications  as  to dollar amount, materiality or Material Adverse Effect
(or similar concept)  set forth in such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation shall be  disregarded.

 

 

(e) Any  claims for indemnification under Section 9.1 shall be net of the
amount of  any  actual recoveries (i) under any insurance policy covering
such indemnifiable  Losses of which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Acquired  Companies) is a beneficiary in connection with the
circumstances that give  rise  to the claim for indemnification  (and 
Buyer shall and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use commercially 
reasonable efforts in pursuing full recovery under all such insurance
policies);  and (ii) under "pass-through" warranty coverage from a
manufacturer or other  third party that are actually received by Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries  (including the Acquired Companies) in connection with
the circumstances that  give rise to the claim for indemnification, but
neither Buyer nor any Acquired  Company shall be obligated to pursue such
warranty coverage.

 

 

(f) Any  claims for indemnification under Section 9.1 or 9.3 shall be made on
an after  tax basis. Accordingly, in determining the amount of any
indemnification payment  for a Loss suffered or incurred by an indemnitee
hereunder, the amount of such  Loss shall be decreased to take into account
any deduction or credit, basis  increase, shifting of income, or other Tax
benefit actually realized by any  indemnitee (or any Affiliate of any
indemnitee) in connection with the Losses  that form the basis of the
indemnitee's claim for indemnification  hereunder  (the " _Tax  Benefit
Adjustment Amount_ ").  In  computing the Tax Benefit Adjustment Amount, the
indemnitee shall be deemed  to  recognize all other items of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit before  recognizing any item arising from the
receipt of any indemnification payment  hereunder or the incurrence or
payment of any indemnifiable Loss; _provided_ ,  that,  if a Tax Benefit
Adjustment Amount is not realized in the taxable period during  which an
indemnifying party makes an indemnification payment or the indemnitee  incurs
or pays any Loss, the parties hereto shall thereafter make payments  to  one
another at the end of each subsequent taxable period to reflect the Tax 
Benefit Adjustment Amount realized by the parties hereto in each such
subsequent  taxable period.

 

 

(g) The  Buyer  Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement if,  and to the extent that, the Losses are reflected on the
Final Adjustment  Statement.

 

 

(h) Notwithstanding  anything else contained herein to the contrary, to the
extent that any of the  Buyer Indemnitees have an indemnification right under
the 2004 Purchase  Agreement (a " _Prior  Claim_ "),  the  Buyer
Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts in pursuing all 
remedies to obtain full satisfaction of such Prior Claim pursuant to the
terms  of the 2004 Purchase Agreement with the survival periods set forth in
Section  9.2(a) tolling while the Buyer Indemnitees are pursuing such
remedies. The  Buyer  Indemnitees shall promptly submit all Prior Claims to
the applicable parties  pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Purchase Agreement
and notify Sellers' Representative with respect to same.

 

 

(i) Any  claims for indemnification under Section 9.1 based upon, arising out
of or  caused by (y) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty  made  in Section 4.7 [Taxes] or (z) any covenant contained in
Article 10 shall be  net  of any Tax benefit realized by any Buyer
Indemnitee (or any Affiliate of any  Buyer Indemnitee) as a result of or in
connection with the Closing Deductions  to  the extent that such Tax benefit
is in excess of the Tax Benefit Deductible  and  has not otherwise been paid
to Sellers pursuant to Section 8.4  hereof.

 

 

9.3 _Indemnification  of Sellers and Beneficial Sellers_.

 

 

From  and  after the Closing Date and subject to Sections 9.4, 9.5 and 9.6,
Buyer  shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless, pay and reimburse Sellers,
Beneficial  Sellers and their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders,  subsidiaries, Affiliates, control persons, successors,
assigns, consultants,  accountants, counsel and other advisors (collectively,
the " _Seller  Indemnitees_ "),  from  and against (a) any Losses based
upon, arising out of or caused by any  inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations and warranties made by  Buyer in Article 5 or in any
certificate or instrument delivered by  Sellers, Beneficial Sellers or
Seller's Representative pursuant to this  Agreement, as of the date such
representation or warranty was made or as if  such  representation or
warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date; (b) any  Losses or Taxes
based upon, arising out of or caused by any breach or  nonperformance of any
covenant or obligation made or incurred by Buyer herein;  and (c) any Taxes
that Buyer covenants and agrees that it is responsible for  in  Section
10.1(b). Buyer does not make and shall not be deemed to have made,  nor  is
any Seller Indemnitee relying upon, any representation, warranty, covenant 
or  obligation other than those representations, warranties, covenants and 
obligations which are expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding 
Sellers' and Beneficial Sellers' right to investigate the affairs of Buyer
or  any knowledge of Sellers, Beneficial Sellers or any of their Affiliates
or  representatives obtained through such investigation, Sellers and
Beneficial  Sellers shall have the right to rely fully on the
representations, warranties,  covenants and obligations of Buyer contained in
this Agreement and any  certificate or instrument delivered by Buyer pursuant
to this  Agreement.

arising out of  or  caused by (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty in  Sections 5.2 [Execution and Delivery;
Enforceability], 5.4 [Brokerage] or 5.5  [Investment Intent; Restricted

give rise to the claim  for  indemnification (and Sellers, Beneficial
Sellers and Sellers' Representative  shall use commercially reasonable
efforts in pursuing full recovery under all  such insurance policies); and
(ii) under "pass-through" warranty coverage from a  manufacturer or other
third party that are actually received by Sellers,  Beneficial Sellers or
Sellers' Representative in connection with the  circumstances that give rise
to the claim for indemnification, but neither  Sellers,  Beneficial Sellers
or Sellers' Representative shall  be  obligated to pursue such warranty
coverage.

 

 

9.5 _Procedures  Relating to Indemnification_.

 

 

9.5.1 _Third-Party  Claims_. 

 

 

In  order  for a party (the " _indemnitee_ ")  to be  entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement with respect  to, arising
out of, or involving a claim or demand made by any Person against  the
indemnitee (a " _Third-Party  Claim_ "),  such  indemnitee must notify the
party from whom indemnification hereunder is sought  (the " _indemnitor_ ") 
in  writing of the Third-Party Claim no later than thirty (30) days after
such  claim  or demand is first asserted. Such notice shall state in
reasonable detail the  amount or estimated amount of such claim, and shall
identify the specific basis  (or bases) for such claim, including the
representations, warranties, covenants  or obligations in this Agreement
alleged to have been breached. Failure to  give  such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except  and only to the extent
the indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as  a  result of such
failure. Thereafter, the indemnitee shall deliver to the  indemnitor, without
undue delay, copies of all notices and documents (including  court papers
received by the indemnitee) relating to the Third-Party Claim  so  long as
any such disclosure could not reasonably be expected to have an adverse 
effect on the attorney-client or any other privilege that may be available 
to  the indemnitee in connection therewith.

 

 

If  a  Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnitee, the indemnitor shall
be  entitled to participate, at its expense, in the defense thereof.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, if the indemnitor irrevocably admits to the
indemnitee in writing  its obligation to indemnify the indemnitee for all
liabilities and obligations  relating to such Third-Party Claim, the
indemnitor may elect to assume and  control the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the indemnitor at the  indemnitor's expense; _provided_ ,  that
if  the indemnitor is a Seller or Beneficial Seller, such indemnitor shall
not  have  the right to assume or control the defense thereof of any such
Third-Party  Claim  that (x) is asserted directly or indirectly by or on
behalf of a Person that  is  a landlord, supplier or customer of any of the
Acquired Companies if in the  reasonable judgment of the indemnitee (which
may be asserted at any time) the  indemnitor's defense thereof could
reasonably be expected to have a material  adverse effect on the indemnitee's
relationship with such landlord, supplier or  customer or (y) is subject to
the limitation set forth in the first sentence  of  Section 9.2(c) and
asserts an amount of Losses which, when taken together with  all amounts paid
to Buyer Indemnitees for resolved indemnification claims  pursuant to this
Agreement that are subject to the limitation set forth in  the  first
sentence of Section 9.2(c) and the maximum aggregate amount of Losses 
alleged in all other unresolved indemnification claims pursuant to this 
Agreement that are subject to the limitation set forth in the first sentence 
of  Section 9.2(c), exceeds $7,000,000. If the indemnitor assumes such
defense,  the  indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense
thereof and to  employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the  indemnitor, it being understood that the indemnitor shall
control such defense;  _provided_ ,  that if  in the reasonable opinion of
counsel of the indemnitee, (i) there are legal  defenses available to an
indemnitee that are different from or additional to  those available to the
indemnitor or (ii) there exists a conflict of  interest between the
indemnitor and indemnitee that cannot be waived, the  indemnitor shall be
liable for the reasonable legal fees and expenses of one  separate counsel to
all of the applicable indemnitees in addition to one local  counsel in each
jurisdiction that may be necessary or appropriate.

 

 

If  the  indemnitor so assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, all of
the  indemnified parties shall reasonably cooperate with the indemnitor in
the  defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include, at the
expense  of the indemnitor, the retention and (upon the indemnitor's request)
the  provision to the indemnitor of records and information which are
reasonably  relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually  convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any  material provided hereunder. If the indemnitor has
assumed the defense of a  Third-Party Claim, (i) the indemnitee shall not
admit any liability with  respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third-Party Claim without  the indemnitor's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed); (ii) the indemnitee
shall agree to any settlement,  compromise or discharge of a Third-Party
Claim which the indemnitor may  recommend and which by its terms
unconditionally releases the indemnitee from  all liabilities and obligations
in connection with such Third-Party Claim;  and  (iii) the indemnitor shall
not, without the written consent of the  indemnitee, enter into any
settlement, compromise or discharge or consent to  the  entry of any
judgment which imposes any obligation or restriction upon the  indemnitee.

 

 

If  the  indemnitor does not or fails to promptly assume or control the
defense of any  Third-Party Claim, or fails to diligently prosecute the
defense of any  Third-Party Claim (as reasonably determined), the indemnitee
may pay, compromise  or defend such Third-Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any Losses based  upon, resulting from or arising out of
such Third-Party Claim.

 

 

9.5.2 _Other  Claims_. 

 

 

In  the  event any indemnitee should have a claim against any indemnitor
under this  Agreement that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the
indemnitee shall  deliver notice of such claim to the indemnitor and the
Escrow Agent (for so  long  as there remain any funds held by the Escrow
Agent) promptly following discovery  of any indemnifiable Loss, but in any
event not later than the last date set  forth in Section 9.2 or 9.4, as the
case may be, for making such claim.  Failure to give such notification shall
not affect the indemnification provided  hereunder except to the extent the
indemnitor shall have been actually  prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Such notice shall state in reasonable  detail the amount or an estimated
amount of such claim, and shall specify the  facts and circumstances which
form the basis (or bases) for such claim, and  shall further specify the
representations, warranties or covenants alleged  to  have been breached.
Upon receipt of any such notice, the indemnitor shall notify  the indemnitee
as to whether the indemnitor accepts liability for any Loss.  If  the
indemnitor disputes its liability with respect to such claim, as provided 
above, the indemnitor and the indemnitee shall attempt to resolve such
dispute  in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 12.4. If
the  indemnitor disputes its liability with respect to such claim as provided
above,  the indemnitor and indemnitee shall attempt to resolve such dispute
in  accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 12.4.

 

 

9.5.3 _Tax  Claims_. 

 

 

Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Section 9.5 to the contrary, any
Third-Party Claim  relating to Taxes shall be handled pursuant to the
procedures in Sections 10.2  and 10.3 hereof.

 

 

9.6 _Limitation  of Remedies_.

 

 

Each  party acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing occur, the sole
and  exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this
Agreement  or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than claims of, or
causes of  action arising from, criminal activity, fraud or claims of, or
causes of action  for which the sole remedy sought is equitable relief) shall
be pursuant to  the  indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 9.
In furtherance of the  foregoing, Buyer, each Seller and each Beneficial
Seller hereby waives on behalf  of himself and all other Persons who might
claim by, through or under him,  from  and after the Closing, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other  than claims of, or causes of
action arising from, criminal activity, fraud  or  claims of, or causes of
action for which the sole remedy sought is equitable  relief) which any such
other Person so claiming by, through or under Buyer,  Sellers or Beneficial
Sellers may have arising under or based upon any Law  and  that relates to
the transaction contemplated herein or to any aspect of the  businesses of
the Acquired Companies (except pursuant to the indemnification  provisions
set forth in this Article 9). Nothing in this Section 9.6 shall  limit any
Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any  Person
may be entitled.

 

 

**ARTICLE  10**

 

 



 

 

**Tax  Matters**

 

 

10.1 _Tax  Matters_.

 

 

(a) _Pre-Closing  Taxes_.  From  and after the Closing Date and subject to
the applicable limitations set forth  in Article 9 (including without
limitation Section 9.2), Sellers and  Beneficial Sellers covenant and agree
that they are responsible for (on a  several basis): (i) Taxes of the
Acquired Companies for periods or portions  thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date and all Taxes that are treated  as  Pre-Closing Taxes in
accordance with Section 10.5 (" _Pre-Closing  Taxes_ ")  in  excess of the
amount of Taxes which are included as current liabilities  (excluding any
reserve for deferred taxes established to reflect timing  differences between
book and Tax income) on the Final Adjustment Statement;  (ii) Taxes of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or  unitary group of which
any of the Acquired Companies is or was a member on  or  prior to the
Closing Date by reason of liability under Treasury Regulation  §1.1502-6,
Treasury Regulation §1.1502-78 or comparable provision of foreign,  state or
local Law; (iii) Taxes required to be paid after the date hereof by  reason
of an Acquired Company being a successor-in-interest or transferee of 
another entity with respect to any taxable period prior to the Closing Date; 
and  (iv) interest at a rate and in the manner provided in the Code for
interest  on  underpayments of federal income tax with respect to any Pre-
Closing Taxes that  are paid by Buyer to the applicable Governmental
Authority and for which Buyer  has provided notice to Sellers' Representative
at least ten (10) Business Days  prior to such payment, measured from the
date of such payment by Buyer to and  including the date on which Sellers and
Beneficial Sellers reimburse Buyer  in  full for such payment.

 

 

(b) _Post-Closing  Taxes_.  From  and after the Closing Date, Buyer
covenants and agrees that it is responsible  for Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for periods or portions thereof beginning  after the Closing Date
(" _Post-Closing  Taxes_ ").

 

 

10.2 _Tax  Procedures_.

 

 

(a) After  the  Closing, each party to this Agreement (whether Buyer,
Seller, or Beneficial  Seller, as the case may be) shall promptly notify the
other party in writing  of  any demand, claim or notice of the commencement
of an audit received by such  party from any Taxing Authority or any other
Person with respect to Taxes for  which such other party is liable pursuant
to this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that a  failure to give such
notice will not affect such other party's rights to  indemnification under
Article 9 of this Agreement, except to the extent that  such party is
actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual  information
(to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability and  shall
include copies of the relevant portion of any notice or other document 
received from any Taxing Authority or any other Person in respect of any
such  asserted Tax liability.

 

 

(b) Payment  by an indemnitor of any amount due to an indemnitee under
Article 10 shall  be made within ten (10) days following written notice by
the indemnitee that  payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing
Authority or other applicable  third party is due by the indemnitee, provided
that the indemnitor shall not  be  required to make any payment earlier than
five (5) Business Days before it  is  due to the appropriate Taxing
Authority or applicable third party. In the case  of a Tax that is contested
in accordance with the provisions of  Section 10.3, payment of such contested
Tax will not be considered due  earlier than the date a "final determination"
to such effect is made by such  Taxing Authority or a court. For this
purpose, a "final determination" shall  mean a settlement, compromise, or
other agreement with the relevant Governmental  Authority, whether contained
in an Internal Revenue Service Form 870 or other  comparable form, such as a
closing agreement with the relevant Governmental  Authority, an agreement
contained in Internal Revenue Service Form 870-AD or  other comparable form,
an agreement that constitutes a "determination" under  Section 1313(a)(4) of
the Code, a deficiency notice with respect to which  the period for filing a
petition with the Tax Court or the relevant state,  local  or foreign
tribunal has expired or a decision of any court of competent  jurisdiction
that is not subject to appeal or as to which the time for appeal  has
expired.

 

 

10.3 _Tax  Audits and Contests; Cooperation_.

 

 

(a) After  the  Closing Date, except as provided in (b) and (c) below, Buyer
shall  control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing, of any
audit, claim  for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding involving
any asserted  Tax  liability or refund with respect to any of the Acquired
Companies (any such  audit, claim for refund, or proceeding relating to an
asserted Tax liability  referred to herein as a " _Contest_ ").

 

 

(b) In  the  case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates to Taxes
for which any  Buyer Indemnitee seeks indemnification under Article 9, Buyer
shall control  the  conduct of such Contest, but Sellers and Beneficial
Sellers shall have the  right  to participate in such Contest at their own
expense, and Buyer shall not settle,  compromise and/or concede such Contest
without the consent of Sellers' Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or  delayed.

 

 

(c) Sellers,  Beneficial Sellers and Buyer agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each  other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including  access to books and records) and assistance relating
to the Acquired Companies  as is reasonably requested for the filing of any
Tax Returns and the  preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any
Contest. Sellers, Beneficial  Sellers and Buyer shall consult and reasonably
cooperate with each other in  the  conduct of any Contest or other
proceeding involving or otherwise relating  to  the Acquired Companies (or
their income or assets) with respect to any Tax  and  each shall execute and
deliver such powers of attorney and other documents  as  are necessary to
carry out the intent of this Section 10.3(c). Any  information obtained under
this Section 10.3(c) shall be kept confidential,  except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax  Returns or in the conduct of
a Contest or other Tax proceeding.

 

 

(d) Buyer  shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, (i) use their
reasonable  best  efforts to properly retain and maintain the tax and
accounting records of the  Acquired Companies that relate to Pre-Closing
Taxable Periods for 10 years  and  shall thereafter provide Sellers'
Representative with written notice prior to  any destruction, abandonment or
disposition of all or any portions of such  records, (ii) transfer such
records to Sellers' Representative upon its written  request prior to any
such destruction, abandonment or disposition and (iii)  allow Sellers'
Representative, at times and dates reasonably and mutually  acceptable to the
parties, to from time to time inspect and review such records  as Sellers'
Representative may deem necessary or appropriate; provided, however,  that in
all cases, such activities are to be conducted by Sellers' Representative
during normal business hours and at Sellers' and Beneficial  Sellers' sole
expense. Any information obtained under this Section 10.3(d)  shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection  with the
filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Contest or other Tax 
proceeding.

 

 

10.4 _Preparation  of Tax Returns_.

 

 

(a) Buyer  shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), and timely file all Tax
Returns of  the  Acquired Companies required to be filed with any Taxing
Authority after the  Closing Date consistent with Section 10.4(b), as
applicable, and Section  10.4(c).

 

 

(b) Buyer  shall cause the Acquired Companies to file within five (5) days
after the  Closing the Form 4466 attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4 seeking the
refund of  the  maximum amount available in prior tax payments (" _Quickie 
Refund_ ").  In  addition, Buyer shall (i) internally prepare or cause an
accounting firm (the  " _Accounting  Firm_ ")  to  prepare within ninety
(90) days after the Closing, (ii) give Sellers' Representative the
opportunity to review pursuant to Section 10.4(c), and (iii)  cause Parent
(or other appropriate Person) to file promptly but in no event  later than
five (5) Business Days following finalization pursuant to Section  10.4(c) of
the following: (i) Tax Returns for the period beginning on  April 2, 2005 and
ending on the Closing Date (the " _Stub  Period Returns_ ");  and  (ii) net
operating loss carryback claims for any filed Tax Return of Parent  that is
allowed to be adjusted for such loss carryback (such Tax Returns and  claims
described in clauses (i-ii) above are collectively referred to as  the "
_Prior  Returns_ ").  Buyer  or the Accounting Firm shall prepare and Buyer
shall cause the Acquired  Companies to file the Prior Returns on a basis, to
the extent permitted by  applicable Law, consistent with those prepared for
prior taxable periods and  to  include the Closing Deductions in the Stub
Period Returns. No election under  Section 172(b)(3) of the Code will be made
to forego the net operating loss  carryback.

 

 

(c) In  the  case of Tax Returns that are filed with respect to a taxable
period that ends  on  or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare such
Tax Return in a manner  consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by Law, and shall  deliver any such Tax Return to Sellers'
Representative for its review at least  thirty (30) days prior to the date
such Tax Return is required to be filed.  If  Sellers' Representative
disputes any item on such Tax Return, it shall notify  Buyer of such disputed
item (or items) and the basis for its objection. The  parties shall act in
good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date  on  which the
relevant Tax Return is required to be filed. If the parties cannot  resolve
any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by an  independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to Sellers' Representative and  Buyer.
The fees and disbursements of such independent accounting firm shall  be 
allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, collectively, on the 
other hand, such that Sellers' share of such fees and disbursements shall be
in  the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items and
amounts  submitted by Sellers' Representative to such independent accounting
firm that  are unsuccessfully disputed by Sellers' Representative (as finally
determined by  such independent accounting firm) bears to the total amount of
such disputed  items and amounts so submitted by Sellers' Representative to
such independent  accounting firm.

 

 

(d) In  the  case of Tax Returns that are filed with respect to Straddle
Periods (as defined  in Section 10.5 below), Buyer shall prepare such Tax
Return in a manner  consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by law.

 

 

10.5 _Straddle  Periods_

 

 

.  For  purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of the Acquired
Companies  that are payable with respect to any Tax period that begins before
and ends  after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle  Period_ "),  the  portion
of any such Taxes that constitutes Pre-Closing Taxes shall: (i) in  the case
of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or  receipts, or
(y) imposed in connection with any sale, transfer or  assignment or any
deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property (real or  personal, tangible
or intangible), be deemed equal to the amount that would  be  payable if the
Tax year or period ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in  the case of Taxes
(other than those described in clause (i) above) that are  imposed on a
periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of the  Acquired
Companies or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be deemed  to  be
the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case 
of  such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for
the  immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of  which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle
Period  ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of  calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (i)
of  the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item 
(including, without limitation, the effect of any graduated rates of tax)
that  is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of
the  Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis
determined by  multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the
Straddle Period  times  a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion  of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which  is the number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period. In the case of  any  Tax based upon or measured by
capital (including net worth or long-term debt)  or  intangibles, any amount
thereof required to be allocated under this  Section 10.5 shall be computed
by reference to the level of such items on  the Closing Date. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing  allocations shall
be made in a manner consistent with past practice of the  Acquired Companies.
The parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by  applicable Law, elect
with the relevant Taxing Authority to treat a portion  of  any Straddle
Period as a short taxable period ending as of the close of business  on the
Closing Date. No election under Treasury Regulation  Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) to ratably allocate income to the  pre-Closing portion
of the Straddle Period shall be made.

 

 

10.6 _Conveyance  Taxes_

 

 

.  Buyer,  on the one hand, and Sellers (collectively), on the other hand,
agree to share  equally all sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp,
registration, documentary,  excise, real property transfer or gains, or
similar Taxes incurred as a result  of the purchase and sale of the
Securities contemplated in this Agreement and  Sellers' Representative and
Buyer agree to jointly file all required change of  ownership and similar
statements.
