representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and

2 ARTICLE I

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

1.1 _Exchange of Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Sellers shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to AcquisitionCo, and AcquisitionCo shall
purchase, acquire and accept for delivery:

 

(a) from LuxCo I, the LuxCo I Acquired Scientx Shares; and

(b) from LuxCo II, the Acquired Groupe Shares.

1.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") to
be paid by AcquisitionCo:

(a) to LuxCo I for the LuxCo I Acquired Scientx Shares shall be a number of
shares of Issuer Common Stock (the "LuxCo I Shares") equal to the product
obtained by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the number of LuxCo I Acquired
Scientx Shares (subject to Section 10.3(b) below); and

(b) to LuxCo II for the Acquired Groupe Shares shall be a number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock (the "LuxCo II Shares", and together with the LuxCo I
Shares, the "Shares") equal to the product obtained by multiplying
the Exchange Ratio by the number of Groupe Acquired Scientx Shares (subject
to Section 10.3(b) below).

1.3  _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Shares shall be issued pursuant to this Agreement and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of
a stockholder of Issuer. In lieu of such fractional share interest, if any,
the Sellers, as applicable, shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest
and subject to the amount of any withholding taxes) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to which such
Seller would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Issuer Common Stock Price.

1.4  _Cancellation of Scient x Options_.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Scientx Option" means each
option to purchase Scientx Shares, whether or not then vested or fully
exercisable, granted to any current or former employee, consultant or director
of Scientx or any Subsidiary of Scientx or any other Person under the (i)
Scientx 2005 Stock Option Plan, as amended, and (ii) Scientx 2008 Stock
Option Plan, as amended, (collectively, the "Scientx Option Plan"), that
remains outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to Closing. For the
sake of clarity, options to purchase shares of Scientx USA, Inc. or Scientx
Shares that are or may be deemed to be outstanding under the Scientx USA,
Inc. 2005 Stock Option Plan are not Scientx Options and shall not be subject
to this Section 1.4.

(b) HPC shall cause Scientx to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the termination and cancellation of all vested and unvested Scientx Options
at Closing and to cause each holder of Scientx Options to execute a written
Release (as defined below) in 



 

3  order to evidence the termination and cancellation of such holders Scientx
Options. In consideration of continued services to be rendered to Scientx,
each holder of an Scientx Option that executes a Release at or prior to
Closing, shall, immediately following the Closing, receive a new option to
purchase shares of common stock of the Issuer on the terms set forth in
Schedule 1.4(b) hereto. The "Release" referred to in the preceding sentence
shall provide in substance that, with respect to an Scientx Option, the
Scientx Option shall be deemed terminated, canceled and of no further force
or effect as between Scientx and the holder and neither party shall have any
further rights or obligations with respect thereto. The Release shall be
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.

1.5 _Payment of Purchase Price_. At the Closing, AcquisitionCo shall pay to
each Seller the Purchase Price payable to such Seller by delivery of the
number of Shares to each Seller determined in accordance with Section 1.2
hereof (subject to Section 10.3(b) below) and, if applicable, the cash in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof.

 

1.6 _Closing Deliveries by Sellers_. At the Closing:

(a) LuxCo I shall deliver, or cause to be delivered to AcquisitionCo:

(i) duly executed share transfer forms ( _ordres de mouvement_ ) or similar
applicable transfer instrument for all of the LuxCo I Acquired Scientx
Shares, completed pursuant to the terms hereof, and any other documents
necessary for the transfer of good and marketable title to the LuxCo I
Acquired Scientx Shares;

(ii) tax registration forms ( _formulaires CERFA_ ) for the sole purposes of
registering the transfer of the LuxCo I Acquired Scientx Shares with the
French tax authorities;

(iii) a deed of release evidencing that the pledge over the LuxCo I Acquired
Scientx Shares granted to Oxford Finance Corporation pursuant to the Scientx
Credit Facility has been released; and 

(iv) the certificates and other documents required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 9.2.

(b) LuxCo II shall deliver, or cause to be delivered to AcquisitionCo:

(i) duly executed share transfer forms ( _ordres de mouvement_ ) or similar
applicable transfer instrument for all of the Acquired Groupe Shares,
completed pursuant to the terms hereof, and any other documents necessary for
the transfer of good and marketable title to the Acquired Groupe Shares;

(ii) tax registration forms ( _formulaires CERFA_ ) for the sole purposes of
registering the transfer of the Acquired Groupe Shares with the French tax
authorities;

(iii) a deed of release evidencing that the pledge over the Acquired Groupe
Shares granted to Oxford Finance Corporation pursuant to the Scientx Credit
Facility has been released; and



 

4 (iv) the certificates and other documents required to be delivered pursuant
to Section 9.2.

1.7 _Closing Deliveries by Issuer_. At the Closing, Issuer and/or
AcquisitionCo, as applicable, shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Sellers, as applicable, pursuant to Section 1.5:

(a) a stock certificate in the name of LuxCo I evidencing the number of LuxCo
I Shares determined in accordance with Section 1.2;

(b) a stock certificate in the name of LuxCo II evidencing the number of
LuxCo II Shares determined in accordance with Section 1.2; and

(c) the certificates and other documents required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 9.3.

1.8 _Simultaneous Actions_. The Parties agree that all actions required to be
taken, and all deliverables required to be delivered, at Closing shall be
deemed to have been taken or delivered simultaneously.

1.9 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned pursuant to the
provisions of ARTICLE X, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver, as the
case may be, of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE IX, the closing of the
Issuer Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (Pacific time) on a date to be
mutually agreed upon by the Parties (the "Closing Date"), which date shall be
no later than the fifth Business Day after all the conditions set forth in
ARTICLE IX (excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied
until the Closing) shall have been satisfied or waived. The Closing shall take
place at the offices of DLA Piper LLP (US), 2000 University Avenue, East
Palo Alto, CA 94303, or at such other location as is agreed to by the
Parties. For purposes of this Agreement, "Business Day" means any day other
than a Saturday or a Sunday on which banks are opened in each of San
Francisco, California, United States, New York, New York, United States,
Paris, France and Luxembourg, Luxembourg.

1.10 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time and from
time to time after the Closing, any further action is necessary or desirable
to vest in AcquisitionCo full right, title and possession over the LuxCo I
Acquired Scientx Shares or the Acquired Groupe Shares, or to vest in the
Sellers full right, title and possession over the Shares to be issued pursuant
to this Agreement, each Seller and the Issuer, as applicable, shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such lawful and necessary or desirable action as is
consistent with this Agreement.

material fine, penalty or other sanctions for violation of any Laws relating
to any Scientx Permit, except as would not reasonably be expected 



 

13  to result in an Scientx Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the
Sellers, the execution, delivery and performance by Scientx of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not result
in the loss or impairment of, or give rise to any right of any Governmental
Authority to terminate, any material Scientx Permit, nor require the consent

business practice of Scientx or its Subsidiaries, any acquisition of

or one of its Subsidiaries all rights to any Intellectual Property relating to
its business that are developed by such employees, consultants
or contractors, as applicable, and that, consistent with commercially

Patents and Scientx Copyrights that are in-licensed from a third party, the
holder of a valid right to use) the Scientx Trademarks, Scientx Patents
and Scientx Copyrights. The owned Scientx Trademarks, Scientx Patents and

19  agreement. All material Scientx Intellectual Property Agreements are in
full force and effect. Each of Scientx and its Subsidiaries is in material
compliance with, and has not breached in any material respect, and has not
committed any action or omission that, with the giving of notice or lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in a material breach of,
any such material Scientx Intellectual Property Agreements and, to the
knowledge of the Sellers, all other parties to such Scientx Intellectual
Property Agreements are in material compliance with, and have not breached any
material term of, such Scientx Intellectual Property Agreements. Scientx

knowledge of the Sellers, no loss or expiration of any Intellectual Property
licensed under any Scientx Intellectual Property Agreement that is material
to the conduct of the business of Scientx or its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted or currently planned is pending or threatened in writing. Neither

that could materially affect any of the respective rights and obligations of
the parties thereunder. Except as disclosed in Section 2.17(j) of the

other provision or contingency which obligates Scientx or any of its

operation of the businesses of Scientx and its Subsidiaries as such
businesses are currently conducted, including the design, development,

Subsidiaries does not infringe, dilute (with respect to Trademarks) or
misappropriate the Intellectual Property of any third party or constitute
unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction. To
the knowledge of the Sellers, there is no Action being asserted or threatened
in writing by any Person (A) with respect to the ownership, validity or
enforceability of any Scientx Intellectual Property owned by Scientx or any
of its Subsidiaries or (B) claiming that Scientx or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in any activity or conduct that infringes upon,
violates or constitutes the unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property
rights of any third party, including any claims of misappropriation of Trade
Secrets. Neither Scientx nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice or claim challenging or questioning the validity or
enforceability of any Scientx Intellectual Property or indicating an
intention on the part of any person or otherwise threatening to bring a claim
that any Scientx Intellectual Property right is invalid, is unenforceable or
has been misused.

of this Agreement and each of the other documents contemplated hereby to
which it is a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, will not result in the loss or impairment of, or give rise

Intellectual Property.

calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any
kind to which Issuer is a party or bound obligating Issuer to issue, deliver

Governmental Authority is pending or has been threatened against Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries.

(b) There are currently pending no internal investigations being conducted by

to any Issuer Permit, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in
an Issuer Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Issuer, the execution,
delivery and performance by Issuer of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, will not result in the loss or
impairment of, or give rise to any right of any Governmental Authority to
terminate, any material Issuer Permit, nor require the consent of any
Governmental Authority in respect of any Issuer Permit, except where the
failure to obtain such consent would not reasonably be expected to result in
an Issuer Material Adverse Effect.

threatened, against Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective
properties, or any of their respective officers or directors (in their

taken any action or failed to take any action therein that is likely to
result in unenforceability of claims later allowed therein, in each case
except as would not reasonably be expected to have an Issuer Material Adverse
Effect.

(c) _Issuer Trade Secrets_. Issuer and each of its Subsidiaries has taken
commercially reasonable steps in accordance with normal industry practice to
protect its rights in its Trade Secrets. Without limiting the scope of the
foregoing representation, Issuer and each of its Subsidiaries enforces a
policy of requiring each employee, consultant and contractor involved in the
development of Issuer 



 

43  Intellectual Property to execute proprietary information, confidentiality
and assignment agreements that assign to Issuer or one of its Subsidiaries all
rights to any Intellectual Property relating to its business that are
developed by such employees, consultants or contractors, as applicable, and
that, consistent with commercially reasonable standards, otherwise protect the
Issuer Intellectual Property and, to the knowledge of Issuer, no such
employee, consultant or contractor is in violation of any material term of any
such agreement.

(d)  _Ownership_. Issuer or one of its Subsidiaries is the sole and exclusive
owner of (or, with respect to Issuer Trademarks, Issuer Patents and Issuer
Copyrights that are in-licensed from a third party, the holder of a valid
right to use) the Issuer Trademarks, Issuer Patents and Issuer Copyrights.
The owned Issuer Trademarks, Issuer Patents and Issuer Copyrights are free and
clear of any and all Liens, other than Permitted Issuer Encumbrances. None of
the directors, corporate officers or employees of Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries owns, directly or indirectly (except for ownership of equity
securities of Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries), in whole or in part, any of
the Issuer Intellectual Property and neither Issuer nor any of its
Subsidiaries has paid or is required to pay, by Law or contract or otherwise,
any amounts to any directors, corporate officers or employees of Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries in respect of the Issuer Intellectual Property.

(e) _Sufficiency of Intellectual Property Assets_. To the knowledge of Issuer,
the Issuer Intellectual Property, together with the rights granted to Issuer
under material contracts, licenses and other agreements relating to
Intellectual Property and to which Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party (the "Issuer Intellectual Property Agreements"), constitute all the
material Intellectual Property required for the continued or currently
contemplated conduct and operation of its business, except for non-exclusive
licenses of generally commercially available software, content or other
Intellectual Property pursuant to a "shrink wrap," "clickwrap," or similar
end-user license or other standard form agreement. All material Issuer
Intellectual Property Agreements are in full force and effect. Each of Issuer
and its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with, and has not breached,
and has not committed any action or omission that, with the giving of notice
or lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in a breach
of, any such material Issuer Intellectual Property Agreements and, to the
knowledge of Issuer, all other parties to such Issuer Intellectual Property
Agreements are in material compliance with, and have not breached any material
term of, such Issuer Intellectual Property Agreements. Issuer and each of its
Subsidiaries has taken all commercially reasonable steps in accordance with
normal industry practice to protect its rights in and to the Issuer
Intellectual Property, which is sufficient for the continued and currently
contemplated conduct and operation of their business.

(f) _No Infringement by Issuer_. To the knowledge of Issuer, the operation
of the businesses of Issuer and its Subsidiaries as such businesses are
currently conducted, including the design, development, marketing and sale of
the products or services of Issuer and its Subsidiaries does not infringe,
dilute (with respect to Trademarks) or misappropriate the Intellectual
Property of any third party or constitute unfair competition or trade
practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction. To the knowledge of Issuer,
there is no Action being asserted or threatened in writing by any Person (A)
with respect to the ownership, validity or enforceability of any Issuer
Intellectual Property owned by Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or (B)
claiming that Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in 



 

44  any activity or conduct that infringes upon, violates or constitutes the
unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property rights of any third party,
including any claims of misappropriation of Issuer Trade Secrets. Neither
Issuer nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or claim
challenging or questioning the validity or enforceability of any Issuer
Intellectual Property or indicating an intention on the part of any person or
otherwise threatening to bring a claim that any Issuer Intellectual Property
right is invalid, is unenforceable, or has been misused.

(g) _No Infringement by Third Parties_. To the knowledge of Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, no third party is misappropriating, infringing, diluting or
violating any Issuer Intellectual Property, and no claims for any of the
foregoing have been brought against any third party by Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries, which claim is currently pending.

(h) _Change of Control_. The execution, delivery and performance by Issuer of
this Agreement and each of the other documents contemplated hereby to which it
is a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, will not result in the loss or impairment of, or give rise to any
right of any third party to terminate, any rights of Issuer or its
Subsidiaries in any Issuer Intellectual Property, nor require the consent of
any Governmental Authority or third party in respect of any such Issuer
Intellectual Property, except as would not be expected to result in an Issuer
Material Adverse Effect.

5.15 _Regulatory Compliance_.

management of Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries for recall, withdrawal,
suspension, seizure or discontinuance, nor has any Issuer Medical Device been
recalled, withdrawn, suspended, seized or discontinued (other than for
commercial or other business reasons) since January 1, 2006 by Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries (whether voluntarily or otherwise), and in each case
except as would not reasonably be expected to have an Issuer Material Adverse
Effect. No proceedings of which Issuer has knowledge (whether completed or
pending) seeking the recall, withdrawal, suspension, seizure or discontinuance
of any Issuer Medical Device are pending against Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries or any licensee of any Issuer Medical Device which individually
or in the aggregate have had or would reasonably be expected to have an Issuer
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Issuer nor any of its Subsidiaries is now or
has ever been subject to the FDAs Application Integrity Policy.

(c) To the knowledge of Issuer, there are no facts, circumstances or
conditions that would reasonably be expected to form the basis for any
investigation, suit, claim, action or proceeding against or affecting Issuer
or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or arising under (i) the FDCA, (ii) the
MDD, the national implementations of the MDD and equivalent laws, (ii) the
FCPA and equivalent anti-bribery Laws, (iii) the Social Security Act or any
equivalent Law relating to the pricing and reimbursement of Issuer Medical
Devices, (iv) regulations of the Office of the Inspector General of the
Department of Health and Human Services, or (v) any other Governmental
Authority, in each case individually or in the aggregate that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have an Issuer Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) Issuer or its Subsidiaries have, filed all annual reports and other
reports (including adverse event reports), supplemental applications and
notices with the FDA, each notified body that has issued a certificate of
conformity for an Issuer Medical Device, and AFSSAPS, as well as any similar
state or foreign Governmental Authority with respect to any Issuer Medical
Device of Issuer or its Subsidiaries.

(e) As to any investigational medical devices under evaluation in the United
States, Issuer and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, are in compliance in all
material respects with all reporting and record-keeping and labeling
requirements set forth in 21 C.F.R. Part 812 with regard to their
investigational medical devices, and other applicable requirements regarding
the promotion of investigational devices.

(a) Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, is a participating
provider, in good standing, in each Payment Program in which Issuer or any of
its Subsidiaries has participated at any time during the last two years (the
"Issuer Payment Programs"). To the knowledge of Issuer, there is no threatened
or pending or concluded investigation, or civil, administrative or criminal
proceeding relating to participation in any Payment Program by Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries. Neither Issuer nor any Subsidiary is subject to, nor has
any of them been subjected to in the two years prior to the date of this
Agreement, any pre-payment utilization review or other utilization review by
any Payment Program. No Payment Program has requested or threatened any
material recoupment, refund, or set-off from Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
and there is no basis therefor. No Payment Program has imposed a material
fine, penalty or other sanction on Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
Issuer nor any of its Subsidiaries has been excluded from participation in any
Payment Program in the two years prior to the Closing Date. Neither Issuer

any Payment Program. All Medicare cost reports, if any, for all periods prior
to the Closing have been accurately completed and timely filed in all material
respects. 

(b) All billing practices of Issuer and its Subsidiaries with respect to all
Payment Programs have been true, fair and correct and in compliance with all
applicable Laws, and all regulations and policies of all such Payment Programs
in all material respects, and neither Issuer nor any of its Subsidiaries has
knowingly billed for or received any payment or reimbursement in excess of
amounts permitted by Law or the rules and regulations of Payment Programs or
contracts therewith.

rendered by Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "Issuer Product") is
fit for the ordinary purposes for which it is intended to be used and
conforms to any promises or affirmations of fact made on the container, label
or instructions for use for such Issuer Product or in connection with its
sale.

5.19 _Product or Service Liability_. Since January 1, 2008, there has been no
claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation by or before any Governmental
Authority pending or, to the knowledge of Issuer, threatened against or
involving Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries relating to (a) any Issuer

have been defective or improperly rendered or not in compliance with
contractual or regulatory requirements, or (b) any Issuer Products delivered
or sold by Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries which are defective or not in
compliance with contractual or regulatory requirements, except in each case
as would not reasonably be expected to result in Losses of more than $100,000
in any individual instance, or more than $250,000 in the aggregate, and in
which the plaintiff sought damages of less than $500,000, in any individual
instance. Before January 1, 2008, and since January 1, 2006, to the knowledge
of Issuer, there has been no claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation

respects with all applicable contractual commitments and all express and
implied warranties, and neither Issuer nor any of its Subsidiaries has any

course of business);

(v) take any action if such action could reasonably be expected to result in
any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in ARTICLE IX of this Agreement

Subsidiaries to, make commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) solicit and
accept customer orders in the ordinary course of business, and (ii) consistent
with applicable Antitrust Laws, cooperate with Scientx in communicating with
suppliers and customers to accomplish the orderly transfer of the business
and operations of Scientx and its Subsidiaries to the control of the Issuer

Prior to the Closing Date, each of the Issuer and Scientx shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its respective operations.

7.4 _HPC and Sellers No Solicitation_. During the Interim Period, HPC and the
Sellers hereby agree that they will, and will cause their respective
Representatives to, cease any existing discussion or negotiation with any
Persons (other than Issuer and its Representatives, and the other
shareholders of Scientx in accordance with Section 8.10 hereof) conducted
prior to the date hereof with respect to any proposed, potential or
contemplated Scientx Acquisition Transaction, and HPC and the Sellers hereby
agree that they shall not, directly or indirectly through any Representative
or otherwise: (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate any
Scientx Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage or participate in negotiations or
discussions concerning, or provide or furnish any information to any Person

will, and will cause its Representatives to, cease any existing discussion or
negotiation with any Persons (other than Scientx, HPC, the Sellers and the
other shareholders of Scientx) conducted prior to the date hereof with
respect to any proposed, potential or contemplated Issuer Acquisition
Transaction, and Issuer hereby agrees that it shall not, directly or
indirectly through any Representative or otherwise: (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or proposals that constitute
an Issuer Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage or participate in negotiations or
discussions concerning, or provide or furnish any information to any Person

the time that the condition set forth in Section 9.1(b) is satisfied (the
"Specified Time"), the Issuer receives a bona fide, unsolicited, written third
party Issuer Acquisition Proposal, the Issuer shall be entitled to engage or
participate in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide or furnish
any information to any Person relating to, such Issuer Acquisition Proposal,
subject to a confidentiality agreement which does not prohibit Issuer from
complying with its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.5 or Section 8.6 of
this Agreement, if (i) the Issuer Board or the Issuer Special Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, that such Issuer Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Issuer
Board or the Issuer Special Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
actions would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (iii) the Issuer has not intentionally and
materially breached this Section 7.5 with respect to such Issuer Acquisition
Proposal. Prior to the Specified Time, the Issuer will promptly (and in any
event with 48 hours) notify the Sellers and HPC of the receipt of any Issuer
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms of and 



 

56  identity of the Person(s) making such Issuer Acquisition Proposal. The
Issuer shall keep the Sellers and HPC reasonably informed of the status and
details of any such Issuer Acquisition Proposal and of any material
amendments or proposed material amendments thereto and will promptly (and in
any event within 48 hours) notify the Sellers and HPC of any determination by
the Issuer Board or the Issuer Special Committee that such Issuer Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

each Party shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve compliance
with, and make, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, all filings
required by, the HSR Act and all other applicable Antitrust Laws; (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to submit as promptly as practicable all

impairing or impeding the authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, actions
or non-actions of a Governmental Authority necessary for the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, and for the consummation of the
Issuer Transactions and all other transactions contemplated hereby.



 

58 (b) Each Party shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
8.4(a), use its commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent permitted by
law, to (i) cooperate with each other, including without limitation by
supplying to each other all reasonably necessary information and documents, in
connection with any filing, submission, or investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other

Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other Parties the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants contained in
Sections 8.4(a) and 8.4(b), if any objections are asserted with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation is instituted, or threatened to be
instituted, by the FTC, the DOJ, or any other applicable Governmental
Authority or private party, challenging the Issuer Transactions or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law, or
which would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or materially delay the
consummation of the Issuer Transactions or other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (an "Antitrust Challenge"), each Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve all such Antitrust Challenges so as to permit
consummation of the Issuer Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (including pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence),
nothing in this Agreement obligates Issuer, AcqusitionHoldCo or AcquisitionCo
(i) to divest, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any action
that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
Scientx (or any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Scientx or

AcquisitionCo or its Affiliates); (ii) to alter or restrict materially the
business or commercial practices of Issuer, AcquisitionHoldco AcquisitionCo,

the contrary in this Agreement (including pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence), nothing in this Agreement obligates Issuer,
AcquisitionHoldco, AcquisitionCo, the Sellers or HPC (i) to change or agree
to change the proposed structure of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including if such change would cause such Antitrust Challenge to be vacated,
lifted, reversed or 



 

59  overturned in a manner that preserves the intended benefits of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or (ii) to agree to modify (A)
the amount or kind of consideration to be received by the Sellers as provided
in this Agreement or (B) any of the material terms of this Agreement.

8.5 _Proxy Statement_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Issuer,
with the timely cooperation and assistance of HPC, Scientx and the Sellers
shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement relating to the meeting
of Issuers stockholders (the "Issuer Stockholders Meeting") to be held to
consider approval of the Issuer Transactions (such proxy statement, as
amended or supplemented, the "Proxy Statement"). The Sellers and HPC shall
provide all information regarding the Sellers, HPC, Scientx Groupe and
Scientx as may reasonably be requested by Issuer for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and to have such document cleared by the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. HPC and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC. Issuer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
stockholders as promptly as practicable upon the earlier of (x) receiving
notification that the SEC is not reviewing the Proxy Statement and (y) the
conclusion of any SEC review of the Proxy Statement. Issuer shall promptly
provide copies, consult with the Sellers and HPC and prepare written responses
with respect to any written comments received from the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and advise the Sellers and HPC of any oral comments received
from the SEC. Issuer shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form
with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act.

(b) If, at any time prior to the Issuer Stockholders Meeting, any event or
circumstance relating to any Party, or any of its respective Affiliates,
shareholders, officers or directors should be discovered by any Party, which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any untrue statement of a material
fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such Party shall
promptly inform the other Parties. As promptly as practicable after
discovering such event or circumstance or being so informed, Issuer, with the
timely cooperation and assistance of the Sellers, HPC and Scientx, shall
prepare and file with the SEC an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement containing a description of such event or circumstance and
disseminate such amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of Issuer. Prior to the occurrence of any Adverse Recommendation
Change, HPC and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon such amendment or supplement prior to filing with the
SEC.

(c) Issuer covenants that the information supplied by Issuer for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement shall not, at (i) the time the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders
of Issuer, (ii) the time of the Issuer Stockholders Meeting and (iii) the
Closing, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they 



 

60  were made, not misleading. All documents that Issuer is responsible for
filing with the SEC in connection with the Issuer Stockholders Meeting, the
Issuer Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will comply as to form and substance in all material aspects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(d) Each of the Sellers and HPC covenants that the information supplied by
such Person for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, at (i) the time
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first
mailed to the stockholders of Issuer, (ii) the time of the Issuer
Stockholders Meeting and (iii) the Closing, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

8.6 _Issuer Stockholders  Meeting_. Issuer shall take all actions in
accordance with Law, the organizational documents of Issuer and the rules of
The NASDAQ Stock Market to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold as promptly as practicable, the Issuer Stockholders Meeting solely for
the purpose of considering and voting upon the issuance of the Issuer Common
Stock in the Issuer Transactions, including, without limitation, the Shares
(the "Issuer Voting Proposal"). Once the Issuer Stockholders Meeting has been
called and noticed, Issuer shall not postpone or adjourn the Issuer
Stockholders Meeting without the consent of HPC, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, other than (i) for the absence of a quorum
or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that it believes in good faith is necessary
under applicable Law and for such supplemental and amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by Issuers stockholders prior to the Issuer
Stockholders Meeting and for the satisfaction of the proviso to the fourth
sentence of this paragraph; provided that in the event that the Issuer
Stockholders Meeting is delayed to a date after the End Date as a result
of either (i) or (ii) above, then the End Date shall be extended to the fifth
business day after such date). Except as expressly permitted by this Section
8.6, (i) the Issuer Special Committee shall recommend approval of the
Issuer Voting Proposal by the stockholders of Issuer and include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) none of the Issuer Special
Committee, the Issuer Board or any other committee of the Issuer Board shall
withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or
modify in any manner adverse to the Sellers or HPC, the recommendation of the
Issuer Special Committee that the Issuers stockholders vote in favor of the
Issuer Voting Proposal (any of the foregoing, or a failure by the Issuer
Board or the Special Committee to recommend approval of the Issuer Voting
Proposal in the Proxy Statement, an "Adverse Recommendation Change") and (iii)
Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the Issuer Voting Proposal and subject to the
fiduciary duties of the directors, shall take all reasonably necessary action
to secure the vote of stockholders required by applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Specified Time,
the Issuer Board or the Issuer Special Committee may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Issuer Board or the Issuer Special Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected
to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided,
further_ , that, in addition to the condition in the immediately preceding
clause, the following 



 

61  additional conditions must first be satisfied prior to effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal: the Issuer has (A)
provided to the Sellers and HPC three Business Days prior written notice
which notice shall (1) state that it has received a Superior Proposal and
describe the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and the
identity of the Person or group making the Superior Proposal, (2) include a
copy of the current draft of each negotiated agreement comprising the Superior
Proposal, and (3) state that the Issuer Board or Issuer Special Committee
intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change due to the existence of
such Superior Proposal; (B) provided to the Sellers and HPC a copy of all
written due diligence materials made available to the Person making the
Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal to the extent that
such materials have not previously been provided to the Sellers and HPC; (C)
during such three Business Days period, if requested by the Sellers or HPC,
engaged in, and caused its financial advisors to have engaged in, good faith
negotiations with respect to any counterproposal to a Superior Proposal or
any amendments to this Agreement; and (D) the Sellers and HPC shall not have,
during such three Business Days period, made, and not withdrawn, a bona fide
written offer (that will be binding on the Sellers and HPC assuming due
authorization and execution thereof by the Issuer) that the Issuer Board or
the Issuer Special Committee has in good faith determined results in the
Superior Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal. Nothing contained in
this Section 8.6 or otherwise contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
prohibit Issuer from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to Issuers
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer Special Committee or
the Issuer Board after consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to
so disclose would conflict with applicable Law; provided, however, that
except as specifically permitted in this Section 8.6, neither the Issuer, the
Issuer Board nor the Issuer Special Committee shall withdraw or modify its
recommendation to approve the Issuer Voting Proposal, or propose to any
person outside the Issuer to approve or recommend an Issuer Acquisition
Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that notwithstanding
an Adverse Recommendation Change, Issuer shall convene and hold the Issuer
Stockholder Meeting, unless the Agreement is otherwise terminated in
accordance with its terms.

8.7 _Support Covenant_. HPC shall appear at the Issuer Stockholders Meeting
or otherwise cause the shares of Issuer Common Stock beneficially owned by HPC
to be present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum, and vote
in favor of the Issuer Transactions.

8.8 _NASDAQ Listing_. Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Shares to be authorized for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the issuance of such Shares.

8.9 _Tax Matters_. No Party shall take any action that would reasonably be
likely to prevent the Issuer Transactions from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (a "368(a) Reorganization"),
and prior to the Closing Date, each Party shall use its best efforts to cause
the Issuer Transactions to qualify as a 368(a) Reorganization.



 

62 8.10 _Minority Shareholders_. The Sellers and HPC shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of BROSE PE TREUHAND GmbH, a
German _Gesellschaft mit beschr ankter Haftung_ ("Brose"), MEDICAL STRATEGIES
MANAGEMENT and CONSULTING SERVICE LTD., a Cyprus corporation ("MSM") and PRIM
S.A., a Spanish _Sociedad An onima_ ("PRIM") and together with Brose and MSM,
the "Minority Scientx Shareholders") to enter into share purchase agreements
with Issuer, AcqusitionHoldCo and AcquisitionCo (the "Minority Purchase
Agreements") providing for the sale and transfer of their Scientx Shares to
AcquisitionCo for the same consideration per share as contemplated herein
and calculated based on the Exchange Ratio. The Minority Purchase Agreements
shall be substantially in the form set forth as _Exhibit C_ attached hereto.
In the event that any Minority Scientx Shareholder has not executed and
delivered a Minority Purchase Agreement within a reasonable time after the
date hereof, the Sellers and HPC will consult with Issuer and the Special
Committee with regard to next steps to be taken with a goal to acquisition of
any such Scientx Shares not yet committed to be sold to Issuer.

8.11 _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. Effective as of the end of the last full
payroll period prior to the Closing, if requested in writing by Issuer at
least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing, the Sellers and HPC shall cause
Scientx to terminate any and all 401(k) plans sponsored or maintained by
Scientx or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall provide Issuer evidence that
each such 401(k) plan has been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board
of directors of Scientx or the applicable Subsidiary, as appropriate, that
are reasonably acceptable to Issuer. HPC shall cause Scientx to provide
copies of all reports, notices, forms, returns or other documentation related
to such plans as are reasonably requested by Issuer after the date hereof.

8.12 _Formation and Joinder of AcquisitionCo and AcquisitionHoldCo_. As
promptly as is reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Issuer shall
complete the formation of AcquisitionCo and AcquisitionHoldCo, including, as
applicable, (i) the preparation, execution and delivery, notarization and, to
the extent necessary, filing with the necessary Governmental Authorities
the requisite documents, including the AcquisitionCo Organizational Documents
and the AcquisitionHoldCo Organizational Documents, (ii) the provision of
adequate capital, (iii) the appointment of the requisite officers, directors
or managers, (iv) the making of the requisite U.S. federal income tax entity
classification elections, and (v) the undertaking of such other acts as may be
necessary or advisable to effect the formation of AcquisitionCo and
AcquisitionHoldCo. Upon the completion of such formation, Issuer shall cause

warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement if such breach
was willful and a material cause of such termination. The provisions of this
Section 10.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 10.3 (Fees and Expenses) and
ARTICLE XI (Miscellaneous Provisions) (to the extent applicable to such
surviving sections) of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

prior to the Closing Date, and attaching proof of payment of same); (B) upon

Sections, subsections or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section,
subsection or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words
"include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in
each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The word "herein"
and similar references mean, except where a specific Section or Article
reference is expressly indicated, the entire Agreement rather than any
specific Section or Article. The table of contents and the headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



 

70 11.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all schedules hereto), the
Corporate Governance Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and other
documents and instruments delivered in connection herewith constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. 

11.5 _Assignment and Successors_. Except as explicitly set forth herein, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party
hereto, and their successors and assigns. This Agreement shall not be assigned
by operation of Law or otherwise, except that Issuer may assign all or any of
its rights hereunder to any Affiliate, provided that no such assignment shall
relieve the assigning Party of its obligations hereunder.

11.6 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. No covenant or other undertakings in this Agreement
shall constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan, policy, program,
or arrangement and any covenant or undertaking that suggests that an employee
benefit plan, policy, program, or arrangement will be amended shall be
effective only upon the adoption of a written amendment in accordance with
the amendment procedures of such plan, policy, program, or arrangement.

11.7 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative; Waivers_. No
failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right
hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. To the
maximum extent permitted by Law, (i) no waiver that may be given by a party
will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and
(ii) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any
obligation of that party or of the right of the party giving such notice or
demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to this Agreement to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of 



 

71  such party. At any time prior to the Closing, any Party may extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts required hereunder
of any other Party, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto made
by any other Party and waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein by any other Party. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument signed by the Party to be
bound thereby.

11.8 _Mutual Drafting; Further Representations_. This Agreement is the mutual
product of the parties hereto, and each provision of this Agreement has been
subject to the mutual consultation, negotiation and agreement of each of the
parties and shall not be construed for or against any party hereto. Each
party to this Agreement acknowledges and represents that it has been
represented by its own legal counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, with the opportunity to seek advice as to its
legal rights from such counsel. Each party further represents that it is being
independently advised as to the tax consequences of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and is not relying on any representation
or statements made by any other party as to such tax consequences.

11.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed in that jurisdiction excluding (to the
greatest extent a Delaware court would permit) any rule of Law that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

11.10 _Enforcement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other. The parties acknowledge and agree that each other party
hereunder would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that
any breach of this Agreement by a party hereunder could not be adequately
compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition
to any other right or remedy to which a party hereunder may be entitled, at
Law or in equity, it shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this
Agreement by a decree of specific performance and temporary, preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any
of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond or other
undertaking.

11.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_. In any action or proceeding between
any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties: (a)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts of the State of
Delaware; (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding
may be heard and determined exclusively in the state courts of the State of
Delaware and (c) consents to service of process in the State of Delaware in
the same manner as notice may be delivered in accordance with Section 11.1.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect
the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law.



 

72 11.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT.

11.13 _Survival_. All representations and warranties of the Sellers, HPC,
AcquisitionCo, AcquisitionHoldCo and the Issuer contained in this Agreement or
incorporated herein by reference or in any certificate delivered by any of
the Parties pursuant hereto will terminate upon, and will not survive, the
Closing. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the covenants and

19 8.2 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, subsections or schedules, such reference shall be to a Section,
subsection or schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words
"include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed
in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The word
"herein" and similar references mean, except where a specific Section or
Article reference is expressly indicated, the entire Agreement rather than any
specific Section or Article. The table of contents and the headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

8.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

8.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits or schedules
hereto), the Registration Rights Agreement and other documents and instruments
delivered in connection herewith constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

8.5 _Assignment and Successors_. Except as explicitly set forth herein, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party
hereto, and their successors and assigns. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by operation of Law or otherwise, except that Issuer may assign all
or any of its rights hereunder to any Affiliate, provided that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of its obligations hereunder.

8.6 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. No covenant or other undertakings in this Agreement shall
constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan, policy, program, or
arrangement and any covenant or undertaking that suggests that an employee
benefit plan, policy, program, or arrangement will be amended shall be
effective only upon the adoption of a written amendment in accordance with the
amendment procedures of such plan, policy, program, or arrangement

8.7 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative; Waivers_. No
failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right
hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. To
the maximum extent permitted by Law, (i) no waiver that may be given by a
party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is
given; and (ii) no notice to or demand on one party 



 

20  will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party or of the
right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to
in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to this Agreement to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. At any time prior to the Closing,
any Party may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts required hereunder of any other Party, waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto made by any other Party and waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein by any
other Party. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument signed by the Party to be bound thereby.

8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed in that jurisdiction excluding (to the
greatest extent a Delaware court would permit) any rule of Law that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

8.9 _Enforcement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other. The parties acknowledge and agree that each other
party hereunder would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that
any breach of this Agreement by a party hereunder could not be adequately
compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition
to any other right or remedy to which a party hereunder may be entitled, at
Law or in equity, it shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this
Agreement by a decree of specific performance and temporary, preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any
of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond or
other undertaking.

8.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_. In any action or proceeding between any
of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties: (a)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the state courts of the State of Delaware; (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined exclusively in the state courts of the State of Delaware and
(c) consents to service of process in the State of Delaware in the same
manner as notice may be delivered in accordance with Section 8.1. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the
right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

8.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.



 

21 8.12 _Survival_. All representations and warranties of Seller, AcquisitionCo.
and the Issuer contained in this Agreement or incorporated herein by
reference or in any certificate delivered by any of the Parties pursuant
hereto will terminate upon, and will not survive, the Closing. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, the covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement to be performed by Seller, AcquisitionCo and the Issuer
prior to Closing will terminate and not survive the Closing.

by and among Alphatec Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Issuer_
"), HealthpointCapital Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _HPC_
"), HealthpointCapital Partners II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("
_HPC II_ " and together with HPC, the " _HPC Entities_ "), and each
additional person who becomes a party hereto pursuant to Section 11(b) or
11(c) by signing a counterpart signature page to this Agreement in the form of
_Exhibit A_ attached hereto.

_I NTRODUCTION_

Reference is made to (i) the Stockholders Agreement, dated as of March 17,
2005 (the " _Stockholders  Agreement_"), among the Issuer, HPC and the
Investors party thereto, and (ii) the Subscription Agreement, dated June 4,
2009, by and between the Issuer and HPC II (the " _Subscription Agreement_ ").
Pursuant to Section 5 of the Stockholders Agreement and Article IV of
the Subscription Agreement, HPC and HPC II, respectively, have certain
registration rights with respect to shares of the Issuers common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (" _Issuer Common Stock_ ").

Reference is made to the Acquisition Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2009,
by and among the Issuer, the HPC Entities, Healthpoint (Luxembourg) I S.a
r.l., a Luxembourg _soci ete a responsabilite limitee_ (" _LuxCo I_ "),
HealthPoint (Luxembourg) II, S.a r.l, a Luxembourg _soci ete a responsabilite
limitee_ (" _LuxCo II_ "), [AcquisitionCo COOP], a Dutch _cooperatie met
uitsluiting van aansprakelijkheid_ (" _AcquisitionCo_ ") and
[AcquisitionHoldCo CV], a Dutch _commanditaire vennootschap_ ("
_AcquisitionHoldCo_ "), (the " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). Pursuant to the
Acquisition Agreement, AcquisitionCo acquired ordinary shares of Scientx,
S.A. (" _Scient x_") and Scientx Groupe S.A.S. from Affiliates of the HPC
Entities in exchange for a number of shares of Issuer Common Stock determined
in accordance with the Acquisition Agreement.

Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the
meanings set forth in the Acquisition Agreement.

In connection with the acquisition of such shares of Issuer Common Stock by
the HPC Entities, and to induce the HPC Entities and Issuer to consummate the
transactions set forth in the Acquisition Agreement, (i) the Issuer has agreed
to enter into this Agreement and to grant to the HPC Entities the rights set
forth in this Agreement and (ii) the HPC Entities have agreed to enter into
this Agreement and to waive or terminate previously granted registration
rights under the Stockholders Agreement and the Subscription Agreement as set
forth in this Agreement. _A GREEMENT_

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual promises

Agreement and prior to the Acquisition Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, a resale registration that qualifies as an " _Excluded Registration_ "
pursuant to the previous sentence shall no longer qualify as an " _Excluded
Registration_ " if such registration has not become effective by the 135th day
after the Acquisition Closing Date.

" _Holder_ " means (i) each of the HPC Entities with respect to shares of
Issuer Common Stock held by the HPC Entities and/or any of their Affiliates,

to all or a portion of the Registrable Securities have been transferred or
assigned in accordance with Section 11(b). 

" _Post Closing Period_ " means the period ending on (a) the 90th day after
the Acquisition Closing Date or (b) if a resale registration statement is
filed by the Issuer prior to the Acquisition Closing Date to register shares
of Issuer Common Stock that are issued and sold by Issuer to third parties in
a private placement transaction that is consummated after the signing of the
Acquisition Agreement and prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the 135th day
after the Acquisition Closing Date.

" _prospectus_ " means any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or
summary prospectus prepared in connection with an offering of any Registrable
Securities.

Act, and the declaration or ordering by the Commission of effectiveness of

the Issuers performance of or compliance with its obligations under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, all (i) registration, qualification
and filing fees; (ii) fees, costs and expenses of compliance with securities
or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of
counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the Registrable

messenger, telephone and delivery (including delivery by mail or courier

above and any other expenses incurred by Holders in connection with any
registration that are not specified in the immediately preceding sentence.

" _Registrable Securities_ " means any shares of Issuer Common Stock owned by
any Holder, but only to the extent such shares of Issuer Common Stock
constitute "restricted securities" under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
the Holder thereof is deemed to be an "affiliate" of the Issuer under Rule
144; _provided, however,_ that Registrable Securities shall not include any
shares of Issuer Common Stock (i) that have been sold to the public pursuant
to a registration statement or Rule 144, (ii) that have been sold in a private
transaction in which the transferors rights under this Agreement are not
assigned, or (iii) that cease to be outstanding.

" _Requestor_ " means either of the HPC Entities, until such time as neither
of the HPC Entities, nor any of their Affiliates or limited or general

that constitute Registrable Securities.

" _Securities Act_ " means the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

2\. _Demand Registrations_.

(a) _Request for Registration_. At any time and from time to time after the
expiration of the Post Closing Period, a Requestor may submit a written
request (a "Demand _Notice_ ") to the Issuer that the Issuer register
Registrable Securities under and in 



 

3  accordance with the Securities Act (a " _Demand Registration_ "), of all or
any portion of the Registrable Securities; provided that the Registrable
Securities to be included in such registration shall have a market value on
the date such Demand Notice is received of at least $10 million, based on the
closing price of the Issuer Common Stock on the trading day immediately
preceding the day on which the Demand Notice is delivered, or shall represent
at least three percent (3%) of the total shares of Issuer Common Stock then
outstanding, or shall represent all Registrable Securities then outstanding.
Such Demand Notice shall specify the number and description of Registrable
Securities to be sold. Upon receipt of the Demand Notice, the Issuer shall:

(i) within five Business Days after receipt of such Demand Notice, give
written notice of the proposed registration to all other Holders; and

(ii) as soon as commercially practicable after expiration of the notice
period set forth in this Section 2(a)(ii), use commercially reasonable efforts
to effect such registration as may be so requested and as would permit or
facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of such
Registrable Securities as are specified in such request, together with all or
such portion of the Registrable Securities of any Holders joining in such
request as are specified in written requests received by the Issuer and who
provide the information required by Section 10 of this Agreement within 20
Business Days after the date the Issuer mails the written notice referred to
in clause (i) above. If no request for inclusion from a Holder is received
within such specified time, such Holder shall have no further right to
participate in such registration.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders a
certificate signed by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer
of the Issuer stating that in the good faith judgment of the disinterested
members of the board of directors of the Issuer, filing a registration
statement on or before the date filing would be required in connection with
any Demand Registration would materially interfere with any pending or
contemplated acquisition, divestiture, financing, registered
primary offering, or other transaction involving the Issuer, or would
otherwise be materially detrimental to the Issuer and its stockholders other
than the Holders or their Affiliates, the Issuer shall have the right to defer
such filing or delay its effectiveness for a reasonable period not to exceed
60 calendar days; _provided_ , that such right shall not be exercised more
than twice with respect to a request for registration hereunder during any
period of twelve consecutive months. The Issuer will pay all Registration
Expenses in connection with such withdrawn request for registration.

(b) _Shelf Registration_. If at the time the Issuer registers Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Section 2, the sale or
other disposition of such Registrable Securities by the Holders may be made on
a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to a registration statement on Form
S-3 (or any successor form that permits the incorporation by reference of
future filings by the Issuer under the Exchange Act), or if Form S-3 is not
available for use by the Issuer, Form S-1 (or any successor form that permits
the incorporation by reference of future filings by the Issuer under the
Exchange Act), then such registration statement, unless otherwise directed by
the Requestor, shall be filed as a "shelf" registration statement pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor rule). Any such shelf
registration shall cover the disposition of all Registrable Securities in one
or more 



 

4  underwritten offerings, block transactions, broker transactions, at-market
transactions and in such other manner or manners as may be specified by the
Requestor and set forth in the plan of distribution included in the
registration statement. Except as provided in Section 6(b) hereof, the Issuer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such "shelf" registration
continuously effective as long as the delivery of a prospectus is required
under the Securities Act in connection with the disposition of the Registrable
Securities registered thereby and in furtherance of such obligation, shall
supplement or amend such registration statement if, as and when required by
the rules, regulations and instructions applicable to the form used by the
Issuer for such registration or by the Securities Act or by any other rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to shelf registrations. Upon their
receipt of a certificate signed by the chief executive officer or chief
financial officer of the Issuer stating that, in the judgment of the Issuer,
it is advisable to suspend use of a prospectus included in a registration
statement due to pending or contemplated material developments or other
events that have not yet been publicly disclosed and as to which the Issuer
believes public disclosure would be detrimental to the Issuer, the Holders
will refrain from making any sales of Registrable Securities under the shelf
registration statement for a period of up to 60 calendar days; _provided_ ,
that this right to cause the Holders to refrain from making sales shall not be
exercised by the Issuer more than twice in any twelve-month period (counting
as a permitted exercise any exercise by the Issuer of its right to defer the
filing or delay its effectiveness of a registration statement under the last
paragraph of Section 2(a)). Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of
such notice from the Issuer, such Holder will forthwith discontinue any
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the shelf registration
statement until the earlier of (X) the expiration of the period indicated in
the certificate, if any, and (Y) the Holders receipt of a notice from the
Issuer to the effect that such suspension has terminated; and shall treat such
notice and any non-public information received in connection therewith in the
strictest confidence and shall not disseminate such information. If so
directed by the Issuer, each Holder will deliver to the Issuer (at the
Issuers expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in the
Holders possession, of the most recent resale prospectus covering such
Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such suspension notice.

(c) _Underwriting_. In connection with any registration under this Section 2,
if the Requestor intends to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by
any registration under this Section 2 by means of an underwriting, it shall so
advise the Issuer in writing; provided that any such underwritten
registration shall be on a firm commitment basis and shall represent gross
offering proceeds to the Holders aggregating at least $10 million. In such
event, the right of any Holder to include its Registrable Securities in such
distribution shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such
underwriting and the inclusion of such Holders Registrable Securities in the
underwriting to the extent provided in this Agreement. The Holders proposing
to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with
the Issuer) enter into an underwriting agreement with one or more underwriters
selected by the Requestor having terms and conditions customary for such
agreements (which underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Issuer). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2, if the
managing underwriter determines that marketing factors require a limitation of
the number of shares to be underwritten, the managing underwriter may limit a
portion of the number of Registrable Securities to be included in such
distribution. The Issuer shall so advise all Holders distributing Registrable
Securities through such underwriting, and the number of Registrable
Securities that may be included in such underwriting shall be allocated among
the Holders in such manner as may be determined by the Requestor.



 

5 (d) _Limitations_.

(i) The Issuer shall not be obligated to effect (A) more than two
registrations under this Section 2 in any twelve (12) month period, (B) any
Demand Registration covering more than 25 million shares of Registrable
Securities, or (C) to have more than one (1) "shelf" registration statement
pursuant to Rule 415 effective under the Securities Act at any time (other
than shelf registrations filed pursuant to Rule 429 under the Securities Act);
_provided_ , that a registration pursuant to this Section 2 shall not be
counted (X) unless the registration statement pursuant to which such
Registrable Securities are being registered is declared effective by the SEC,
or (Y) if following such effectiveness, the Issuer delivers a certificate
pursuant to Section 2(b) suspending the use of the related prospectus prior to
the sale of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities by the Holders
covered by such registration statement.

(ii) The Issuer shall be permitted to exclude such Holders Registrable
Securities from a registration statement if such Holder fails to timely comply
with the Issuers request for information pursuant to Section 10; _provided_ ,
if such Holder provides such information prior to the filing of such
registration statement (or prior to the final amendment thereto prior to such
registration statement being declared effective) the Issuer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to include such Registrable Securities in
such registration statement.

3\. _Piggy-back Registration_.

(a) _Notice of Registration_. If at any time or from time to time the Issuer
shall determine to register any of its capital stock, whether or not for its
own account (other than pursuant to a Demand Registration, an Excluded
Registration, any registration effected pursuant to Form S-4, S-8 or any
successor forms, any registration relating solely to the sale of securities
to participants in Issuer employee benefit plans, any registration relating
to the reorganization of the Issuer or other transaction under Rule 145 of the
Securities Act, or any registration on any form that does not include
substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a
registration statement covering the sale of Registrable Securities (other than
information relating to the Holders)), the Issuer shall:

(i) provide to each Holder written notice thereof at least 15 Business Days
prior to the filing of the registration statement by the Issuer in connection
with such registration; and

(ii) include in such registration, and in any underwriting involved therein,
all those Registrable Securities specified in a written request by each
Holder received by the Issuer within ten Business Days after the Issuer mails
the written notice referred to above, subject to the provisions of this
Section 3\.



 

6 Upon their receipt of a certificate signed by the chief executive officer or
chief financial officer of the Issuer stating that, in the judgment of the
Issuer, it is advisable to suspend use of a prospectus included in a
registration statement due to pending or contemplated material developments or
other events that have not yet been publicly disclosed and as to which the
Issuer believes public disclosure would be detrimental to the Issuer, the
Holders will refrain from making any sales of Registrable Securities under the
registration statement for a period of up to 60 calendar days;  _provided_ ,
that this right to cause the Holders to refrain from making sales shall not be
exercised by the Issuer more than twice in any twelve-month period (counting
as a permitted exercise any exercise by the Issuer of its right to defer
the filing or delay its effectiveness of a registration statement under the
last paragraph of Section 2(a)). Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of such
notice from the Issuer, such Holder will forthwith discontinue any disposition
of Registrable Securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement until
the earlier of (X) the expiration of the period indicated in the certificate,
if any, and (Y) the Holders receipt of a notice from the Issuer to the effect
that such suspension has terminated; and shall treat such notice and any non-
public information received in connection therewith in the strictest
confidence and shall not disseminate such information. If so directed by the
Issuer, each Holder will deliver to the Issuer (at the Issuers expense) all
copies, other than permanent file copies, then in the Holders possession, of
the most recent resale prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the
time of receipt of such suspension notice. 

(b) _Underwriting_. The right of any Holder to registration pursuant to this
Section 3 shall be conditioned upon the participation by such Holder in the
underwriting arrangements specified by the Issuer in connection with such
registration and the inclusion of the Registrable Securities of such Holder in
such underwriting to the extent provided in this Agreement. All Holders
proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through such underwriting
shall (together with the Issuer) enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the managing underwriter selected for such underwriting
by the Issuer and take all other actions, and deliver such opinions and
certifications, as may be reasonably requested by such managing underwriter.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3, if the managing
underwriter determines that marketing factors require a limitation of a
portion of the number of shares to be underwritten, the managing underwriter
may limit the number of Registrable Securities to be included in such
registration. The Issuer shall so advise all Holders distributing Registrable
Securities through such underwriting, and in the event that Registrable
Securities in a registration would exceed twenty five percent (25%) of all
shares included in such registration, the Issuer may limit the number of
Registrable Securities included in such registration to not less than twenty
five (25%) of the number of shares included in such registration, and in such
case the number of Registrable Securities that may be included in
such registration shall be allocated among the Holders in such manner as may
be determined by the Requestor.

(c) _Right to Terminate Registration_. The Issuer shall have the right to
terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 3
whether or not any Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities in
such registration without incurring any liability to any Holder.



 

7 (d) _Limitations_.

(i) The Issuer shall not be required to include more than 25 million shares of
Registrable Securities in any individual registration under this Section 3\.

(ii) The Issuer shall be permitted to exclude such Holders Registrable
Securities from a registration statement if such Holder fails to timely
comply with the Issuers request for information pursuant to Section 10;
_provided,_ if such Holder provides such information prior to the filing of
such registration statement (or prior to the final amendment thereto prior to
such registration statement being declared effective) the Issuer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to include such Registrable Securities on such
registration statement.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Registrable
Securities which are subject to any lock-up or covered by an effective
registration statement on Form S-3 will not be entitled to the registration
rights set forth in this Section 3\.

4\. _Holdback Agreements_.

(a) _Holders of Registrable Securities_. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary and to the extent not inconsistent with
applicable law, upon the request of the applicable underwriter, each holder of
Registrable Securities shall not effect any public sale or distribution
(including sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of Issuer
Common Stock, enter into a transaction which would have the same effect, or
enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in
part, any economic consequences of ownership of such securities, whether any
such aforementioned transaction is to be settled by delivery of such
securities or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly disclose the
intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge or disposition, or to
enter into any such transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement, in each
case during the 10 days prior to and the 90 days after the effective time of
any underwritten piggy-back registration pursuant to Section 3 hereof in which
any of such holders Registrable Securities are included (except as part of
such underwritten piggy back registration) (a "Stand-off Period"), except as
otherwise agreed to by the underwriter managing any such underwritten
registration. If (i) the Issuer issues an earnings release or other material
news or a material event relating to the Issuer during the last 17 days of the
Stand-off Period or (ii) prior to the expiration of the Stand-off Period, the
Issuer announces that it will release earnings results during the 16 day
period beginning upon the expiration of the Stand-off Period, then to the
extent necessary for a managing or co-managing underwriter of a registered
offering required hereunder to comply with NASD Rule 2711(f)(4), the Stand-
off Period shall be extended until 18 days after the earnings release or the
occurrence of the material news or event, as the case may be. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 4(a) shall only apply if (i)
all officers and directors of the Issuer enter into similar agreements and
(ii) no such officer or director is released in whole or in part from his or
her obligations under such agreement unless all Holders are similarly
released from the provisions of this Section 4(a) as to the same percentage of
their Issuer Common Stock as to which such officer or director is released.

  

 

8 (b) _The Issuer_. The Issuer shall agree to such limitation on its public
sale or distribution of Issuer Common Stock as may be reasonably requested by
the managing underwriters in connection with any underwritten registration;
provided, that such limitations shall not continue beyond the 135th day after
the effective date of the registration statement in question.

5\. _Expense of Registration_. All Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with the registration and other obligations of the Issuer pursuant
to Sections 2, 3 and 6 shall be borne by the Issuer, and all underwriting
discounts and selling commissions incurred in connection with any such
registrations shall be borne by the Holders of the securities so registered
pro rata on the basis of the number of shares so registered.

6\. _Registration Procedures_. If and whenever the Issuer is required by the
provisions of this Agreement to effect the registration of Registrable
Securities, the Issuer shall:

(a) promptly prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement
with respect to such Registrable Securities on any form that may be utilized
by the Issuer and that shall permit the disposition of the Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition
thereof, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective as promptly as practicable and
remain effective thereafter as provided in this Agreement, _provided_ , that
if a Holders Registrable Securities are covered by such registration
statement, then prior to filing a registration statement or prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto, the Issuer will furnish to the Requestor,
its counsel and the underwriters copies of all such documents proposed to be
filed sufficiently in advance of filing to provide them with a reasonable
opportunity to review such documents and comment thereon;

(b) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments (including post-
effective amendments) and supplements to such registration statement and the
prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be
necessary to keep such registration statement effective and current and to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the sale or
other disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement, including such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and
supplements as may be necessary to reflect the intended method of disposition
by the prospective seller or sellers of such Registrable Securities,
_provided_ , that, (i) except in the case of a shelf registration, such
registration statement need not be kept effective and current for longer than
90 days subsequent to the effective date of such registration statement and
(ii) in the case of a shelf registration, such shelf registration need not be
kept effective and current after the second anniversary of the effective date
of such registration statement;

(c) subject to receiving reasonable assurances of confidentiality and subject
to limitations reasonably imposed by the Issuer to preserve attorney client
privilege, for a reasonable period after the filing of such registration
statement, and throughout each period during which the Issuer is required to
keep a registration effective, make available for inspection by the Holders
of Registrable Securities being offered, and any underwriters, and their
respective counsel, such financial and other information and books and records
of the Issuer, and cause the officers, directors, employees, counsel and
independent certified public accountants (subject to 



 

9  such reasonable procedures and limitations as such parties may require) of
the Issuer to respond to such inquiries as shall be reasonably necessary, in
the judgment of such counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within
the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act;

(d) promptly notify the Holders of Registrable Securities being offered and
any underwriters and confirm such advice in writing, (i) when such
registration statement or the prospectus included in such registration
statement or any prospectus amendment or supplement or post-effective
amendment has been filed, and, with respect to such registration statement or
any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any
comments by the Commission, by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("
_FINRA_ "), and by the blue sky or securities commissioner or regulator of any
state with respect thereto or any request by any such entity for amendments or
supplements to such registration statement or prospectus or for additional
information, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation or threatening
of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) of the receipt by the Issuer of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, or (v) at any time when a
prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, that such
registration statement, prospectus, prospectus amendment or supplement or
post-effective amendment, or any document incorporated by reference in any of
the foregoing, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, and at the request of any Holder, the Issuer will prepare a
supplement or amendment to such prospectus, so that, as thereafter delivered
to purchasers of such shares, such prospectus will not contain any untrue
statements of a material fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading;

(e) furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities being offered, a
signed counterpart, addressed to such Holder (and, if applicable, any of its
Affiliates), of (i) any opinion of counsel to the Issuer delivered to any
underwriter and (ii) any comfort letter from the Issuers independent public
accountants delivered to any underwriter;

(f) furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities being offered, and any
underwriters, prospectuses or amendments or supplements thereto, in such
quantities as they may reasonably request and as soon as practicable, that
update previous prospectuses or amendments or supplements thereto;

(g) use all commercially reasonable efforts to (i) register or qualify the
Registrable Securities to be included in a registration statement under this
Agreement under such other securities laws or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions within the United States of America as any Holder of such
Registrable Securities being offered or any underwriter of the securities
being sold shall reasonably request, (ii) keep such registrations or
qualifications in effect for so long as the registration statement remains in
effect and (iii) take any and all such actions as may be reasonably necessary
or advisable to enable such Holder or underwriter to consummate the
disposition in such jurisdictions of such Registrable Securities owned by such
Holder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Issuer shall not 



 

10  be required for any such purpose to (x) qualify generally to do business as
a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not otherwise be
required to qualify but for the requirements of this Section 6(g) or (y)
consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

(h) cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed or accepted for
quotation on an Eligible Market ( _provided_ , that the Issuer shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Eligible Market to be one of the
stock exchanges identified in clauses (i) through (v) of the definition of "
_Eligible Market_ ");

(i) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable
Securities not later than the effective date of such registration statement;

(j) upon the sale of any Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration
statement, remove all restrictive legends from all certificates or other
instruments evidencing the Registrable Securities; and

(k) otherwise use all commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable provisions of the Securities Act, and rules and regulations of the
Commission, and make available to the Holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve months
beginning not later than the first day of the Issuers fiscal quarter
next following the effective date of the related registration statement,
which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and
Rule 158 thereunder.

7\. _Indemnification_. In the event any of the Registrable Securities are
included in a registration statement under this Agreement: 

(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Holder, and each of its respective officers, employees,
affiliates, directors, partners, members, attorneys and agents, and each
person, if any, who controls the Holder within the meaning of the Securities
Act (each, a " _Holder Indemnified Party_ "), from and against any expenses,
losses, judgments, claims, damages, liabilities, charges, actions,
proceedings, demands, settlement costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), whether joint or several, arising out
of or based upon (i) any untrue statement (or allegedly untrue statement) of a
material fact contained in any registration statement under which the sale of
such Registrable Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
prospectus contained in the registration statement, or any amendment or
supplement to such registration statement, offering circular or other document
incident to any such registration or compliance, (ii) any omission (or
alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) any violation by the Issuer of
the Securities Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder applicable
to the Issuer, or of any blue sky or other state securities law or any rule or
regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the Issuer, in each case,
relating to action or inaction required of the Issuer in connection with any
such registration; and the Issuer shall promptly reimburse any Holder
Indemnified Party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Holder Indemnified Party in connection with 



 

11  investigating and defending any such Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Issuer will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
Losses arises out of or are based upon any untrue statement or allegedly
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration
statement, prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished to the Issuer, in writing, by
such Holder expressly for use therein. If requested by any underwriter (as
defined in the Securities Act) of the Registrable Securities, the Issuer also
shall indemnify such underwriter and any of its officers,
affiliates, directors, partners, members and agents and each person who
controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the
indemnification provided above in this Section 7(a).

(b) Each Holder of Registrable Securities being offered will, in the event
that any registration is being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to
this Agreement of any Registrable Securities held by such Holder, indemnify
and hold harmless the Issuer, each of its directors and officers and each
underwriter (if any), and each other selling Holder and each other person, if
any, who controls the Issuer, another selling Holder or such underwriter
within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any Losses, whether joint or
several, insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any registration statement under which the sale of
such Registrable Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
prospectus contained in the registration statement, or any amendment or
supplement to the registration statement, offering circular or other document
incident to any such registration or compliance or (ii) any omission or the
alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, in each case if the statement or
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to the Issuer by such selling Holder expressly for use
therein, and shall reimburse the Issuer, its directors and officers, and each
other selling Holder or controlling person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigation
or defending any such Losses. The indemnification obligations hereunder of
each Holder of Registrable Securities being offered shall be several and not
joint and shall be limited to the amount of any net proceeds actually
received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to
the applicable claim, less all other amounts paid as damages in respect
thereof.

(c) In order for a person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under Section 7(a) or (b) in respect of, arising
out of or involving a claim made by any person against the Indemnified Party
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the party
required to provide the indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in
writing of the Third Party Claim promptly following receipt by such
Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly
following the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the Third Party Claim.



 

12 (d) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof by notifying the
Indemnified Party in writing to such effect within 30 days of receipt of the
Indemnified Partys notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_
, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be that of such Indemnified Party unless (i)
the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or
proceeding and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party in any such action or proceeding or (iii) the named parties to any such
action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall
have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses
available to such Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified
Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing of an election to employ
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or
proceeding on behalf of such Indemnified Party, it being understood, however,
that the Indemnifying Party then shall have the right to employ separate
counsel at its own expense and to participate in the defense thereof, and
shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate
but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same
jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of
attorneys at any time for all Indemnified Parties, which firm shall be
designated in writing by a majority of the Indemnified Parties who are
eligible to select such counsel); _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim unless (i) the Indemnifying Party acknowledges fully the
rights of the Indemnified Party (and does not contest, as a whole or in part)
the Indemnified Partys indemnification rights for the Third Party Claim,
(ii) the counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party is reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party, (iii) the Indemnified Party is kept informed of all
material developments and is furnished copies of all material papers filed or
sent to or from the opposing party or parties and (iv) the Indemnifying Party
prosecutes the defense of such Third Party Claim with commercially reasonable
diligence in a manner which does not materially prejudice the defense of such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not give timely notice in
accordance with the preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed
to have given notice that it does not wish to control the handling of
such Third Party Claim. In the event the Indemnifying Party elects (by notice
in writing within such 30 day period) to assume the defense of or otherwise
control the handling of any such Third Party Claim for which indemnity is
sought, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Indemnified Party from and against any and all reasonable professional fees
(including attorneys fees, accountants, consultants and engineering fees) and
investigation expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to such
election, notwithstanding the fact that the Indemnifying Party may not have
been so liable to the Indemnified Party had the Indemnifying Party not elected
to assume the defense of or to otherwise control the handling of such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense in accordance with
this Section 7(d), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate
in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being
understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense.



 

13 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the fees
and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such
Third Party Claim) if the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or
other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after
conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related
claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other relief portion of
the Third Party Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion
relating to money damages. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such
claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, consent to entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation. No Indemnified Party may consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party
Claim, all the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the indemnifying party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

(f) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with
respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to in this
Agreement, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying the
Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such Indemnified Party with respect to such loss, liability, claim, damage or
expenses in the proportion that is appropriate to reflect the relative fault
of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in connection with the
statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage,
or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact or the omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the
Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The contribution obligation of a Holder hereunder, if any, shall be limited to
the amount of any net proceeds actually received by such Holder from the sale
of Registrable Securities giving rise to the applicable claim, less all other
amounts paid as damages in respect thereof.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on
indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement
entered into in connection with an underwritten public offering are in
conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting
agreement shall control.



 

14 8\. _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the benefits of
certain rules and regulations of the Commission which may at any time permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the
Issuer shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to:

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act; 

(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Issuer under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act; and

(c) furnish to any Holder promptly upon request a written statement as to its
compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, and of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, and a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of the Issuer.

The provisions of this Section 8 shall terminate on the date on which there
are no Holders of Registrable Securities

9\. _Termination of Registration Rights_. With the exception of Section 8, no
Holder shall be entitled to exercise any right provided for in this Agreement
after the date on which all Registrable Securities held by such Holder may be
sold in a single three-month period under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

10.  _Information To Be Provided by and Received from the Holders_. Each
Holder whose Registrable Securities are to be included in any registration
pursuant to this Agreement, as a condition to having such Registrable
Securities so included, shall furnish the Issuer, upon at least three
Business Days request, such information regarding such Holder and the
distribution proposed by such Holder as may be reasonably requested in writing
by the Issuer and as shall be required in connection with such registration
or the registration or qualification of such securities under any applicable
state securities law (including, without limitation, a signed Notice and
Questionnaire in the form attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto). Each Holder agrees
to provide the Issuer with any updates to such information as promptly as
practicable during the effectiveness of the registration statement. The Issuer
may exclude from such registration the Registrable Securities of any such
Holder who fails to furnish such information at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the initial filing of the registration statement (or such shorter
period requested by the Issuer). The Holders each agree that information
relating to the Issuer obtained by such Holder or by such Holders Affiliates
or representatives shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used by such
Holder as the basis for any market transactions in the securities of the
Issuer unless and until such information is made generally available to the
public.

11\. _Miscellaneous_.

(a) _No Inconsistent Agreements_. Except for the registration rights being
terminated or waived pursuant to Section 11(k) hereof, the Issuer represents
and warrants to the Holders that it has not entered into, and covenants with
the Holder that it will not enter into, any agreement with respect to the
Issuer Common Stock which is inconsistent with, dilutes or violates
the registration rights granted to the Holders under this Agreement.



 

15 (b) _Transfer of Rights_. Each Holder shall be entitled to transfer or assign
at any time any of its rights (but only with all related obligations) under
this Agreement, in connection with the transfer of all or a portion of its
Registrable Securities, to any of the following: (i) any partner (including a
general or limited partner) or retired partner of any Holder that is a
partnership, (ii) any Affiliate of such Holder, (iii) any stockholder of any
Holder that is a corporation, (iv) any member of any Holder that is a limited
liability company or (v) any transferee that acquires at least the greater of
10% of the total number of Registrable Securities or 750,000 shares of
Registrable Securities (subject to appropriate adjustment for any stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization or similar transaction); _provided_ , that
in each such case, the Issuer receives written notice within ten (10) days of
any transfer and the transferee agrees to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement by signing a counterpart signature page to this Agreement in the
form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto.

(c) _Minority Scient x Shareholders_. In the event that any of BROSE PE
TREUHAND GmbH, a German _Gesellschaft mit beschr ankter Haftung_ (" _Brose_
"), MEDICAL STRATEGIES MANAGEMENT and CONSULTING SERVICE LTD., a Cyprus
corporation (" _MSM_ ") and PRIM, S.A., a Spanish _Sociedad An onima_ ("
_PRIM_ " and together with Brose and MSM, the " _Minority Scient x
Shareholders_") enter into share purchase agreements with Issuer,
AcquisitionHoldCo and AcquisitionCo (the " _Minority Purchase Agreements_ ")
providing for the sale and transfer of their shares in Scientx to
AcquisitionCo for the same consideration per share as contemplated in the
Acquisition Agreement and calculated based on the Exchange Ratio set forth in
the Acquisition Agreement, then each such Minority Shareholder that has
entered into a Minority Purchase Agreement shall have the right to become a
party to this Agreement by execution of a counterpart signature page hereto
in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto. Upon becoming a party to this
Agreement, each such Minority Scientx Shareholder shall be deemed a Holder
for all purposes under this Agreement.

(d) _Notices_. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries
required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing to the
address provided for notices set forth on the signature page hereto, as
updated from time to time by written notice from the Holders to the Issuer,
and shall be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (a) the date
of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile
or email at the facsimile number or email address specified below prior to
6:30 p.m. (Eastern time) on a Business Day, (b) the next Business Day after
the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via
facsimile or email at the facsimile number or email address specified below on
a day that is not a Business Day or later than 6:30 p.m. (Eastern time) on any
Business Day, (c) the Business Day following the date of deposit with a
nationally recognized overnight courier service, or (d) upon actual receipt by
the party to whom such notice is required to be given.

(e) _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid
or unenforceable in any respect, the validity and enforceability of the
remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby and the parties will attempt to agree upon a
valid and enforceable provision that is a reasonable substitute therefor,
and upon so agreeing, shall incorporate such substitute provision in this
Agreement.



 

16 (f) _Amendments and Waivers_. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or
amended except in a written instrument signed by the Issuer and the
Requestor; provided, that no amendment is required to effect the inclusion of
the Minority Scientx Shareholders as parties to this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11(c). Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this
Section shall be binding upon each Holder of any Registrable Securities then
outstanding, each future holder of all such Registrable Securities and the
Issuer. No waiver of any default with respect to any provision, condition or
requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the
future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other
provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or omission
of either party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the
exercise of any such right.

(g)  _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_. This Agreement
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that
jurisdiction excluding (to the greatest extent a Delaware court would permit)
any rule of Law that would cause the application of the Laws of any

_Selling Shareholder Notice and Questionnaire_

The undersigned beneficial holder of shares of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (the " _Registrable Securities_ "), of Alphatec Holdings,
Inc. (the " _Company_ "), understands that the Company has filed, or intends
to file, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") a
registration statement (the " _Registration Statement_ "), for the
registration and resale of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the
terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, dated [ _ _ _
_], 2010 (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_ "), between the Company,
Healthpoint Capital Partners, L.P., Healthpoint Capital Partners II, L.P. and
certain other shareholders of the Company. A copy of the Registration Rights
Agreement is available from the Company upon request at the address set forth
below. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning
ascribed thereto in the Registration Rights Agreement.

Each beneficial owner of Registrable Securities is entitled to the benefits
of the Registration Rights Agreement. In order to sell or otherwise dispose of
any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement, a
beneficial owner of Registrable Securities generally will be required to be
named as a selling shareholder in the related Prospectus, deliver (or cause to
be delivered) a Prospectus to purchasers of Registrable Securities and be
bound by those provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement applicable to
such beneficial owner (including certain indemnification provisions, as
described below).

shareholders in the Prospectus and will not be permitted to sell any
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement. Beneficial
owners are required to complete and deliver this Notice and Questionnaire on
or before the third (3rd) day prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement so that such beneficial owners may be named as selling shareholders
in the related Prospectus at the time the Registration Statement becomes
effective.

Certain legal consequences arise from being named as a selling shareholder in
the Registration Statement and the related Prospectus. Accordingly, holders
and beneficial owners of Registrable Securities are advised to consult their
own securities law counsel regarding the consequences of being named or not
being named as a selling shareholder in the Registration Statement and
the related Prospectus.
