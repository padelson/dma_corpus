The Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the Issuer) enter into an underwriting agreement with one or more underwriters selected by the Requestor having terms and conditions customary for
such agreements (which underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Issuer). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section&nbsp;2, if the managing underwriter determines that marketing factors require a limitation of the
