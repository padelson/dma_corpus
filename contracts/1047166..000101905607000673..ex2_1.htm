pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, its Shares shall be deemed to be
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration for each such Share in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company

such exercise of appraisal rights or offer to settle any such rights.

 

  SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Shares and
Stock Units_. (a) The Company shall provide that, immediately prior to the

canceled, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a payment in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the number of Common
Shares previously subject to such Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the

previously subject to such Option, less any required withholding taxes. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Options the cash payments
described in this Sect  ion 2.2(a) on or as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date, but in any event within two (2) business days
thereafter.

  

 (b) Each Common Share granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan (collectively, " _Restricted Shares_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time and at the Effective Time the holder thereof shall, subject to this Article II, be entitled to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration with respect to each such Restricted Share, less any required withholding taxes.

immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of a right under any
Company Stock Plan entitling the holder thereof to performance shares, Common
Shares or cash equal to or based on the value of Common Shares (collectively,
" _Stock Units_ ") which, in each case, is outstanding as of the Effective
Time (whether vested or unvested) (except with respect to those awards set
forth on _Section 2.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which will be
treated in accordance with the terms of such awards) shall be canceled by the
Company and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive upon consummation
of the Merger a payment in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A)

  SECTION 2.3 _Surrender of Shares_. (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with a bank
or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as
agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which the
stockholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to this Article II.
At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of holders of Shares, sufficient funds
to immediately pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. Such funds may be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such invest  ment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders
of Shares and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company
in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall be in short-
term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more
than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced
by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
Parent directs.

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of (i) an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates, or in the case of Book-Entry Shares the surrender of such Shares, for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or book-entry shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the 

  

-6-  

#####

 

 right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Article II.

 

  (c) At any time following the date that is
twelve months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for
payment of the Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with
the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration.

 

  (d) After the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the
Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in, this Article II.

 

  (e) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former
holder of Shares pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax (as defined herein) laws.

  

 (f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the reasonable replacement requirements established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

 

  (g) No dividends or other distributions with
respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

  SECTION 2.4 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of
outstanding Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares) shall occur as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, merger or any stock dividend
or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such change.

 The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except (i) as set forth on the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face or (ii) for facts disclosed in, and reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure contained in, the SEC Reports (as defined herein) filed with the SEC and publicly available after January 1, 2005 but prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any forward-looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, any disclosures in any section relating to forward-looking statements and any other similar disclosures included therein to the extent they are primarily predictive or forward-looking in nature); _provided_ that in no event shall any disclosure in any such SEC Report qualify or limit the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the second sentence of Section 3.2, Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.4 unless otherwise set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule:

 

  SECTION 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.
Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept
of good standing) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and
has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where any such failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing or to have such power or authority would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein). Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the n ature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for any such failure to be so qualified or
licensed which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any fact, circumstance,
event, change, effect or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate
with all other facts, circumstances, events, changes, effects, or occurrences,
(a) has or would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on
or with respect to the assets, business, results of operations or financial
condition of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (b) would
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of the Company to
consummate the Merger, _provided, however_ , that, in the case of (a) only, a
Material Adverse Effect shall not include facts, circumstances, events,
changes, effects or occurrences (i) generally affecting the economy or the
financial, debt, credit or securities markets in the United States, including
as a result of changes in geopolitical conditions, (ii) generally affecting
any of the industries in which the Company or its subsidiaries operate, (iii)
resulting from the announcement of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any stockholder litigation relating thereto or
including any termination of, reduction in or similar negative impact on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with any customers, suppliers,
distributors, partners or employees of the Company and its subsidiaries due to
the announcement and performance of this Agreement or the identity of the
parties to this Agreement, or the performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including compliance with the covenants set
forth herein, (iv) resulting

  

-8-  

#####

 

 from any actions expressly required under this Agreement to obtain any
approval or authorization under applicable antitrust or competition laws for
the consummation of the Merger, (v) resulting from changes after the date
hereof in any applicable laws or applicable accounting regulations or
principles or interpretations thereof, _provided_ that in the case of this
clause (v) such changes shall not be excluded to the extent that such changes
have a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole compared with other companies operating in any of the
principal industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate, (vi)
resulting from any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or war or any act of
terrorism, or (vii) resulting from any failure by the Company to meet any
published analyst estimates or expectations of the Companys revenue, earnings
or other financial performance or results of operations for any period, in
and of itself, or any failure by the Company to meet its internal or published
projections, budgets, plans or forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other
financial performance or results of operations, in and of itself (it being
understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to any
such failure that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of a
"Material Adverse Effect" may be taken into account in determining whether
there has been a Material Adverse Effect), except, in the case of clauses (i),
(ii) and (vi) above, such facts, circumstances, changes, events, effects or
occurrences shall not be excluded to the extent that they have a materially
disproportionate effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole
compared with other companies operating in any of the principal industries in
which the Company and its subsidiaries operate.

Company has heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to Parent a

incorporation, as amended to date (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "),

3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list,

Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), but excluding any plan
that is a "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA ("
_Multiemployer Plan_ ")), (ii) each plan, agreement or arrangement providing
for the issuance, award or payment of equity, performance, bonus, retention,
change in control, severance or similar compensation or benefits and (iii)
each other material benefit or co mpensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, vacation or sick pay policy and fringe benefit plan, in each case
that is contributed to, sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries for the benefit of any current, former or retired employee,
officer, consultant, independent contractor or director of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ").

 

  (b) With respect to each material Company
Plan (it being understood and agreed that for the purposes of the first
sentence of Section 3.10(a), this Section 3.10(b) and Section 3.10(d), any
employment agreement with respect to any employee with an annual base salary
that is less than $150,000 shall not be considered a "material Company Plan"
or, in the case of Section 3.10(d) only, a "Company Plan"), the Company has
made available to Parent a current, accurate and complete copy thereof (or, if
a plan is not written, a written description thereof) and, to the extent
applicable, (i) any related trust agreement or other funding instrument, (ii)
the most recent determination letter, if any, received from the Internal
Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), (iii) any summary plan description and (iv)

new material Company Plan, or to materially increase the benefits under any
existing material Company Plan.

  

 (c) Each Company Plan has been established and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and other applicable laws, rules and regulations. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) with respect to each Company Plan, no actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened; (ii) no administrative investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding by the United States Department of Labor (" _DOL_ "), the IRS or other Governmental Entity, including any voluntary compliance submission through the IRSs Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or the DOLs Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program, is

 pending, in progress or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with
respect to any Company Plan; (iii) no non-exempt "prohibited transaction"
within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or
breach of fiduciary duty has, to the knowledge of the Company, occurred with
respect to any Company Plan; and (iv) neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not
been satisfied in full, and to the knowledge of the Company, no condition
exists that presents a risk to the Company or its subsidiaries of incurring
any such liability other than liability for premiums due in the ordinary
course and without default to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("
_PBGC_ "). Each Company Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has received a determination letter to
that effect from the IRS and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
circumstances exist which would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect such qualification. With respect to any Multiemployer Plan to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries has any liability or contributes (or has at
any time contributed) or had an obligation to contribute, neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any material withdrawal liability
under Title IV of ERISA and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such
multiemployer plan is in reorganization or is insolvent (as those terms are
defined in sections 4241 and 4245 of ERISA, respectively) or has incurred a
mass withdrawal (as defined in PBGC regulations).

  

 (d) No Company Plan exists that as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any Company Employee to severance pay, retention pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by applicable law, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount or otherwise cause the payment, of compensation to, any such employee, consultant or officer, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

 

  (e) With respect to each material Company
Plan maintained in a jurisdiction outside of the United States or for
employees outside of the United States, including any such plan required to be
maintained or contributed to by applicable law, custom or rule of the relevant
jurisdiction (" _Foreign Plan_ "): (i) each Foreign Plan is and has been
operated and maintained in all material respects in accordance with applicable
laws; and (ii) all employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Plan
required by law or by the terms of such Foreign Plan have been made in all
material respects, or, if applicable, accrued in all material respects in
accordance with normal accounting practices. Each Foreign Plan is listed on
_Schedule 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

  (f) The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with another
event) will not result in any payment or other benefit to any Company Employee
that would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment," as such term is
defined in Section 280G of the Code, and neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to any contract, arrangement or plan pursuant to which
it is bound to compensate any Company Employee for any excise or other
additional taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby for
purposes of the applicable provisions of the DGCL, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub, alone or together with any other person, was at any time, or became, an

existing debts, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature);

enter into a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision or with
a standstill provision less favorable to the Company if it waives or similarly

requirements of Section 6.5(d)(iv) (any such Interested Person, an " _Excluded
Person_ "), together with appropriate cross references to the Acquisition
Proposal, documents and related correspondence provided by or on behalf of
each Excluded Person. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Excluded Person shall cease to be an Excluded Person for all
purposes under this Agreement at such time as the Acquisition Proposal made by

judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, to satisfy the requirements
of Sections 6.5(d)(iv).

 

  (b) Subject to Section 6.5(d), from the day
immediately after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall not, nor

respect to any Excluded Person, on the day immediately after the No-Shop
Period Start Date: (A) the Company shall, and shall direct each of its and its

affiliates) that has made or indicated an intention to make an Acquisition
Proposal, in each case that exist as of the No-Shop Period Start Date; (B) the
Company shall promptly request that each person (other than Parent and its
affiliates) who has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company
in connection with that persons consideration of an Acquisition Proposal
return or destroy all non-public information furnished to that person by or on
behalf of the Company and (C) the Company shall promptly inform its and its
subsidiaries Representatives of the Companys obligations under this Section
6.5 and shall instruct such Representatives to notify the Company as promptly

 related material communications to or by the Company or its or its
subsidiaries Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause its

subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent.

 

  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 6.5(b), nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company
or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with
the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making
any legally required disclosure to stockholders with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal ( _provided_ that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors may
recommend any Acquisition Proposal unless permitted by this Section 6.5(d) and
the Company may not fail to make, or withdraw, modify or change in a manner
adverse to Parent all or any portion of, the Recommendation unless otherwise
expressly permitted by this Agreement); (ii) prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Vote, providing access to its properties, books and records and
providing information or data in response to a request therefor (A) by any
Excluded Person or (B) by a person or group who, following the No-Shop Period
Start Date, has made an Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of
this Section 6.5 that the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and
financial advisors, is credible and constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and that the failure
to provide such access would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware law, if the Board of Directors receives from the person so requesting
such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary
in order for the Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement and it being understood that the Company may enter into a
confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision or with a standstill
provision less favorable to the Company if it waives or similarly modifies the
standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement); (iii) prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, contacting and engaging in discussions
with any person or group and their respective Representatives who, following
the No-Shop Period Start Date, has made an Acquisition Proposal not solicited
in violation of this Section 6.5, solely for the purpose of clarifying such
Acquisition Proposal and any material terms thereof and the conditions to
consummation so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; (iv) prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, contacting and engaging in any
negotiations or discussions (A) with any Excluded Person or its
Representatives or (B) with any person or group and their respective
Representatives (which negotiations or discussions are not solely for
clarification purposes) who has made an Acquisition Proposal not solicited in
violation of this Section 6.5 that the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and
financial advisors, is credible and constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware law; (v) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, withdrawing,
modifying or changing in any adverse manner the Recommendation (which shall be
permitted only to the extent permitted by Section 6.1); or (vi) prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, recommending to the stockholders of the
Company an Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section
6.5 that the Board of

  

-38-  

#####

 

 Directors of the Company reasonably believes is credible, if and only to the
extent that the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisors,
that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably capable of being
consummated, taking into account legal, financial, regulatory, timing and
similar aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, that
taking such action is necessary in order for the Board of Directors to act in
a manner that is consistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, and
that such Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result in a Superior
Proposal.

 

  (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section
6.5 to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite
Vote, the Companys Board of Directors (i) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, in
response to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach
of Section 6.5(b), that such proposal is a Superior Proposal, and (ii)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that such action is required in order for the Board of Directors to act in a
manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company
or its Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 6.5(e), and any purported termination pursuant to this sentence
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company prior to or
concurrently with such termination pursuant to this Section 6.5(e) pays to
Parent the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i);
_provided further_ that, the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 6.5(e) unless (x) it notifies Parent in writing of its
intention to take such action at least three (3) business days prior to taking
such action, specifying the material terms of such Superior Proposal and
identifying the person(s) making such Superior Proposal, and (y) Parent does
not make, after being provided with reasonable opportunity to negotiate with
the Company and its and its subsidiaries Representatives, within three (3)
business days of receipt of such written notification, an offer that the
Board of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors, results in the applicable
Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal.

  

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings assigned below:

       

 

  |  

  (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group of persons (other than

taken as a whole, or 25% or more of any class or series of Company Securities,
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person or group of Persons beneficially owning 25% or more of any class or
series of capital stock of the Company, or any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any
subsidiary or subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 25% or
more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

transactions contemplated hereby (x) after receiving the advice of a financial
advisor (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm) and (y)
after taking into account all   such factors and matters deemed relevant in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, including legal (with the
advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any

collective bargaining agreements for employees covered by such collective
bargaining agreements).

  

 (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries (i) following the Effective Time, to provide compensation (including salary, bonus, commission and other cash incentive compensation) to Company Employees, which in the reasonable discretion of Parent is no less favorable in the aggregate than compensation provided to similarly situated employees employed by similarly situated businesses, subject to the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries in their reasonable discretion to review and modify compensation from time to time, and (ii) until December 31, 2008, to provide Company Employees health and medical benefits that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company under the Company Plans;  _provided_ that no provision of this Section 6.6 shall give any Company Employee any right to continued employment or impair in any way the right of the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Company Employees. Nothing herein shall, from and after the Effective Time, prevent the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Company Plan to the extent permitted by such Company Plan (or not precluded by such Company Plan) or interfere with the right or obligation of the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable law, or restrict the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries from making normal and reasonable increases in employee costs for benefit coverages or such other changes as Parent determines, in Parents reasonable discretion, to be appropriate or desirable.

 

 -40-

  (c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to give Company Employees full credit
for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans), under
any employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation)

_Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that pre-Effective Time
service of a Company Employee need not be recognized with respect to the
benefits provided by a Parent Plan to the extent that such Parent Plan is not
a successor to or replacement of a Company Plan. With respect to each Parent
Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to (i) cause
there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and
(ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such
conditions, limitations or claims would have been recognized under a
corresponding Company Plan.

  

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (x) each existing employment, change in control, severance and termination protection plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of that company, and (y) all obligations pursuant to outstanding restoration plans, programs or agreements, bonus plans or programs, bonus deferral plans, vested and accrued benefits under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (and any amounts deferred thereunder) of the Company or its subsidiaries and similar employment compensation and benefit arrangements and agreements in effect as of the date hereof and continued through the      Effective Time or implemented subsequent to the date hereof in accordance with Section 5.1 and continued through the Effective Time, in each case to the extent legally binding on the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

 

  (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending ninety days thereafter, to not effectuate a "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN affecting in
whole or in part any site of employment, facility, operating unit of the
Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary, without complying in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of WARN.

    

  (f) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are
solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or
former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) or any other
person shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the
Agreement and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company
Plan for any purpose. Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation or any subsidiary from terminating the employment of any Company
Employee at any time and for any reason. Neither Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor any subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
to provide any equity-based compensation to any Company Employee.

  SECTION 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and
Insurance_. (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any person may
have under any indemnification agreement, employment agreement or Company
Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, except as set forth on _Section 6.7(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the full extent permitted by applicable
law, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and
hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer,
director or employee of the Company and its subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees a nd disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each,
a " _Proceeding_ ") to which an Indemnified Party is or becomes a party or
with respect to which an Indemnified Party is or becomes otherwise involved
(including as a witness), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including any Proceeding arising
out of or pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), whether such Proceeding is commenced, or any claim or
matter therein is asserted or claimed, prior to, at or after the Effective
Time. Except as set forth on _Section 6.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, in the event of any such Proceeding (x) each Indemnified Party will
be entitled to advancement from Parent or the Surviving Corporation of fees,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements)
incurred in connection with and prior to the final disposition of such
Proceedings, such fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and disbursements) to be advanced within ten business days of receipt by
Parent from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification, (y) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding
in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party (which term
for purposes of this clause (y) only shall include only those persons who are
officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as
of the date of this Agreement) hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise
or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (z) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter.

  

 (b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers than those set forth in _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_ hereto, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 

  (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to purchase a six-year prepaid "tail
policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering
without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Tail Policy_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the cost of the Tail Policy

 

 -42-  

#####

 

 exceeds 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement with respect to its current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance, then (x) the Company shall consult with Parent
prior to purchasing the Tail Policy and (y) without Parents prior written
consent, the Company shall not purchase the Tail Policy prior to the date that
is twenty days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. In the event that the
Company is unable to purchase a Tail Policy as provided in the preceding
sentence, Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase,
prior to the Effective Time, the Tail Policy. If neither Parent nor the
Company has purchased a Tail Policy, Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in
effect for six years from the Effective Time the current policies of the
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (
_provided_ that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which
are not less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and from insurance
carriers with comparable credit ratings; _provided, however_ , that after the
Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess
of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of
this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. The Company represents that the last annual
premium of the Company prior to the date hereof is as set forth in _Section
6.7(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent agrees to honor and perform
under, and to cause the Surviving Corporations to honor and perform under,
all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Party is a party to or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) in any Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.7 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 

  (e) This covenant is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives. The rights to
indemnification and advancement and the other rights provided for herein shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

 

  (f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation
or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in Section 6.6 and this
Section 6.7.

 

  SECTION 6.8 _Further Action; Efforts_. (a) Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws

  

-43-

foregoing, (i) each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, including
requesting early termination of the HSR waiting period, and (ii) Parent shall,
with the assistance of the Company, prepare a request for an Advance Ruling
Certificate pursuant to Section 102 of the Competition Act (Canada) and shall
file such request as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten
business days of the date hereof and each party shall supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the Competition Act (Canada) and take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the exemption from, or expiration or
termination of the waiting period under Part IX of the Competition Act
(Canada) including, if an Advance Ruling Certificate is not issued within 30
days of the filing of the request therefor, the filing of notification
materials as promptly as possible thereafter. Parent and the Company shall
each bear one-half of the filing fees associated with all filings under the
HSR Act and Foreign Antitrust Laws.

 

  (b) Subject to all applicable confidentiality
requirements and all applicable laws, each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the
efforts referenced in Section 6.8(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the

all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably
informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or
foreign Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case in connection
with any Antitrust Law relating to the transactions contemplated hereby; and
(iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and
consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC,
the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the
FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other person,
give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences, in each case in connection with any Antitrust Law
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that
no party hereto shall be required to provide any other party with copies of
confidential documents or information included in its filings and submissions
under the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Law, _provided, further_ , that a party
hereto may request entry into a joint defense agreement as a condition to
providing any such materials and that, upon receipt of that request, the
parties shall work in good faith to enter into a joint defense agreement to
create and preserve attorney-client privilege in a form and in substance
mutually acceptable to the parties. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all
other federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative

merger or acquisition, including the Competition Act (Canada).

 

  (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of the parties contained in Sections 6.8(a) and (b), if any

instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or
any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its best efforts
to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, in order to  resolve
such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, selling, holding
separate or otherwise disposing of or conducting its business in a manner
which would resolve such objections or suits or agreeing to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business in a manner which
would resolve such objections or suits or permitting the sale, holding
separate or other disposition of, any of its assets or the assets of its
subsidiaries or the conducting of its business in a manner which would resolve
such objections or suits. Without excluding other possibilities, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be materially
delayed if unresolved objections or suits delay or could reasonably be
expected to delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
beyond the date which is the earlier of six months from the date of this
Agreement and one month from the date of the Stockholders Meeting.

  

 (d) Subject to the obligations under Section 6.8(c), in the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, (i) each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and      (ii) Parent and Merger Sub must defend, at their cost and expense, any action or actions, whether judicial or administrative, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant
party is subject, wherever situated, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final
form and

 content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required,
shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.

  

 SECTION 6.10 _Parent Financing_.

 

  (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitments, including reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing (including by
consummating the Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing), (iii) enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions
contained in the Debt Financing Commitments or consistent in all material
respects with the Debt Financing Commitments, including any "flex"
provisions, or on other terms that would not materially and adversely impact
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the
Closing. Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, agree to or
permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its
rights under, any Financing Commitment or any definitive agreements related to
the Financing, in each case, without the Companys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except any such
amendment, supplement or other modification to the Debt Financing Commitments
that would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that, subject to the
requirements of this sentence, such amendment, supplement or other
modification of the Debt Financing Commitments may provide for the assignment
of a portion  of the Debt Financing Commitment to additional agents or
arrangers and the granting to such persons of approval rights as are
customarily granted to additional agents or arrangers) shall be permitted
hereunder without the Companys prior written consent. Upon any such
amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Financing Commitments in
accordance with this Section 6.10(a), Parent shall provide a copy thereof to
the Company and the term "Debt Financing Commitments" shall mean the Debt
Financing Commitments as so amended, supplemented or modified.

  

 (b) In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the last day of the Marketing Period, alternative financing from alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,       in the event that (x) all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as High Yield Financing has not been consummated, (y) all closing conditions contained in Article VII have been satisfied or waived (other than those contained in Sections 7.2(c) and 7.3(c)) and (z) the Bridge Financing described in or contemplated by the Debt Financing

 

 -46-  

#####

 

 Commitments (or Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this
Section 6.10(b)) is available on terms and conditions described in or
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (or replacements thereof in
accordance with this Section 6.10(b)), then Parent shall consummate, or cause
to be consummated, and shall use, or cause to be used, the proceeds of such
Bridge Financing (or such Alternative Financing) to replace such High Yield
Financing no later than the last day of the Marketing Period. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period of 25
consecutive business days after the date hereof throughout which (1) Merger
Sub shall have the Required Financial Information that the Company is required
to provide to Merger Sub pursuant to Section 6.10(d) and (2) the closing
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 shall be satisfied and nothing has
occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied assuming the
Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such 25-day period.

  

 (c) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of any material breach by any party of the Debt Financing Commitments (or commitments for any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with Section 6.10(b)) of which Parent becomes aware or any termination of the Debt Financing Commitments (or commitments for any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with Section 6.10(b)). Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with Section 6.10(b)).

  SECTION 6.11 _Company Notes and Debentures Tender and Consent
Solicitation._

 

  (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after
the written request of Parent, the Company shall commence, or shall cooperate
with Parent in connection with Parents or Merger Subs commencing, in each
case in compliance with applicable law and SEC rules and regulations, (i) one
or more offers (the " _Debenture Offers_ ") to purchase some or all of the
outstanding Company Notes and Debentures (as defined below), and (ii) one or
more solicitations as part of the Debenture Offers (the " _Solicitations_ ")
of consents to amend the respective indentures governing the various Company
Notes and Debentures (the " _Indentures_ ") from the holders of not less than
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the respective series of
Company Notes and Debentures outstanding at the time of the Debenture Offers
(the consents from each such series of such holders, the " _Requisite
Consents_ "). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, such
Solicitations and/or Debenture Offers shall not require any payment to be made
prior to the Effective Time for the Company Notes and Debentures and/or the
consents under such Solicitations.

 

  (b) In connection with any Solicitation and/or
Debenture Offer commenced by the Company upon the request of Parent hereunder,
Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation, including
the offer to purchase, the terms of the consent, related letters of
transmittal and other related documents and any Schedule TO or other filing
with the SEC (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "). All mailings to the
holders of the Company Notes and Debentures in connection with any
Solicitation and/or Debenture Offer or related filings with the SEC shall be
subject to the prior review and comment by each of the Company and Parent and
shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall cooperate, and the Company shall cause its subsidiaries to
cooperate, and each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its respective representatives to cooperate,
with each other in connection with any such Solicitations and/or Debenture
Offers (including the preparation of the Offer Documents) and use reasonable
best efforts to cause the initial settlement of the Debenture Offers to occur
simultaneously with the Effective Time; _provided_ that neither the
consummation of the Debenture Offers nor the Solicitations shall be a
condition to the Closing.

    

 (c) Upon the written request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Consents. Promptly upon receipt of Requisite Consents permitting an amendment of an Indenture governing a series of the Company Notes and Debentures and upon the request of Parent, the Company shall enter into a supplemental indenture reflecting the amendments to such Indenture approved by such Requisite Consents and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the indenture trustee to promptly enter into such supplemental indenture;  _provided_ that the amendments contained in such supplemental indenture shall become effective upon signing, but not operative until the Effective Time and, if applicable, the acceptance of the applicable Debenture Offer. The closing of any Debenture Offer shall be conditioned on the simultaneous occurrence of the Closing. Simultaneously with the Closing and in accordance with the terms of any Solicitation and/or Debenture Offer, if the Company shall

   

 -49-  

#####

 

 have undertaken such Solicitation and/or Debenture Offer, Parent or Merger
Sub shall provide the Company the funds necessary to consummate such
Solicitation and/or Debenture Offer (including the payment of all applicable
premiums, consent fees and all related fees and expenses), and the Company, if
applicable, shall accept for purchase and use such funds to purchase the
Company Notes and Debentures tendered in such Debenture Offer. If, at any time
prior to the completion of any Debenture Offer and Solicitation, any
information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company or
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer
Documents so that the Offer Documents shall not contain an untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that  discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
disseminated by the Company to the holders of the Notes. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.11(c), the Company shall comply
with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
applicable law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection with any
Debenture Offer and Solicitation. To the extent that the provisions of any
applicable law conflict with this Section 6.11(c), the Company shall comply
with the applicable law and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations hereunder by such compliance.

  

 (d) If requested by Parent, the Company shall enter into one or more dealer manager agreements with such persons as Parent shall reasonably request in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) the reasonable fees and expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with any Solicitation and/or Debenture Offer.

 

  (e) Subject to Section 8.2, if this Agreement
is terminated prior to the consummation of the Merger, Parent shall promptly
reimburse the Company and any dealer-manager under any dealer-manager
agreement for any out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the
Company in connection with this Section 6.11. If the Effective Time does not
occur, Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers
and directors, any dealer-manager and each Person, if any, who controls the
Company within the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act, for and against
any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in accordance
with the Debenture Offer, Solicitation, Offer Documents or any other actions
taken by them in accordance with this Section 6.11; _provided, however_ , that
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless any such person to the extent that any such liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred arise from disclosure provided by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries that is finally judicially determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have contained a material misstatement or omission or arise
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of representatives of the
Company or its subsidiaries.

 

  (f) At Parents request, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent in causing the satisfaction and discharge and/or
covenant defeasance provisions of the Company Notes and Debentures and the
respective Indentures pursuant to which they were issued to be satisfied on

  

-50-  

#####

 

 the date of the Closing; _provided_ that Parent shall have sole
responsibility for making any payments to the applicable indenture trustee and
otherwise satisfying the requirements and conditions that must be satisfied in
connection therewith. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all costs
incurred in connection with such satisfaction and discharge or covenant
defeasance, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Companys
outside counsel, accountants and/or financial advisors to the extent that
Parent requests one or more of them to prepare or deliver any documentation
required in connection therewith.

 

  (g) As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Company Notes and Debentures_ " means, collectively, such debt instruments of
the Company and its subsidiaries as shall be identified by Parent.

 

  SECTION 6.12 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising
out of any real estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property
owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the
Merger, shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be
a liability of stockholders of the Company.

 

  SECTION 6.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take
all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement, the Debt Financing
Commitments and any Alternative Financing.

"moratorium," "business combination," "control share acquisition" or other
form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the date
of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger, and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this Section 6.14 shall be
construed to perm it Parent or Merger Sub to do any act that would
constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of any of the Companys
rights under, any other provision of this Agreement.

  

 SECTION 6.15 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

  SECTION 6.16 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, upon obtaining knowledge of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event that, individually or in the aggregate, would make the timely
satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Article VII impossible or
unlikely. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.16 shall not
cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter or otherwise limit or affect the

 

 -51-  

#####

 

 remedies available hereunder to any party receiving such notice. This
Section 6.16 shall not constitute a covenant, obligation or agreement for
purposes of Section 7.2(b) or 7.3(b).

 

  SECTION 6.17 _Maintenance of Listing_. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws, including
the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, to ensure that the
Common Shares remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange at all times prior
to the Closing Date and that the Company remains in compliance in all material
respects with the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange.

 

  SECTION 6.18 _Stockholders Agreements_. The Company shall
comply with its obligations under the terms of the Stockholders Agreements.

  

 SECTION 6.19 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors arising after the date hereof as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement in connection therewith shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

to be made pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 8.2(b) as a result of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii), (y) as promptly as reasonably
practicable in the case of a payment required to be made pursuant to clause

termination), and (z) upon the earlier of the Companys entering

 into an agreement providing for, or consummating, an Acquisition Proposal in
the case of a payment required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) of this
Section 8.2(b), it being understood that such payment shall be payable in all
cases by wire transfer of same day funds and that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean an amount equal to
$100,000,000, except in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii) to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date
(or, in the event that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
as of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the first day following the No-Shop
Period Start Date that such Acquisition Proposal has failed to constitute a
Superior Proposal for a continuous three business day period), in which case
the Company Termination Fee shall mean an amount equal to $40,000,000 so long
as the financing, if any, for such Superior Proposal is covered by binding
commitment letters for debt and equity sufficient to cover the entire purchase
price (to the extent payable in cash) and all other consideration and expenses
necessary to consummate such Superior Proposal.

 

  (c) In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) or Section 8.1(d)(ii),
then Parent shall pay $100,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") to the
Company or as directed by the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and, in any event, within two business days following such termination),
payable by wire transfer of same day funds. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall Parent be obligated to pay, or cause to paid, the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

 (d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with any action (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street      Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment.

 

  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, including with respect to Sections 7.4 and 9.10, (i) the
Companys right to terminate this Agreement in compliance with the provisions
of Sections 8.1(d)(i) and (ii) and its right to receive the Parent Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(c) or the guarantee thereof pursuant to the
Guarantee, and (ii) Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e)(i) and (ii) and its right to receive the Company Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) shall, in each case, be the sole and exclusive
remedy, including on account of punitive damages, of (in the case of clause
(i)) the Company and its subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantor or any of their respective affiliates, stockholders, general
partners, limited partners, members, managers, directors, officers, employees
or agents (collectively " _Parent Related Parties_ ") and (in the case of
clause (ii)) Parent and Merger Sub against the Company or its subsidiaries,
affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents
(collectively " _Company Related Parties_ "), for any and all loss or damage
suffered as a result thereof, and upon any termination specified in

  

-57-  

#####

 

 clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 8.2(e) and payment of the Parent
Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee, as the case may be, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor or any of their respective Parent Related
Parties or the Company or any of the Company Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation of any kind or nature relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a
result of such termination. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Parent
Termination Fee and the Company Termination Fee constitute liquidated damages
and are not a penalty and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for recovery
by the Company and its subsidiaries or Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may
be, in the event of the termination of this Agreement by the Company in
compliance with the provisions of Section 8.1(d)(i) or (ii) or Parent pursuant
to Section 8.1(e)(i) and (ii), including on account of punitive damages. In
no event, whether or not this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to any
provision hereof, shall Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor or the Parent Related
Parties, either individually or in the aggregate, be subject to any liability
in excess of the Parent Termination Fee for any or all losses or damages
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including breaches by Parent or Merger Sub of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, and in no event shall the Company seek equitable relief or seek to
recover any money damages in excess of such amount from Parent, Merger Sub,
Guarantor or any Parent Related Party or any of their respective
Representatives.

 

  SECTION 8.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (except that, subject
to Section 8.2(a), expenses (x) incurred in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and (y) in respect of the filing
fee required under the HSR Act and the Competition Act (Canada) in connection
with the filings required in connection with the Merger shall, in each case,
be shared equally by Parent and the Company).

  

 SECTION 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; _provided, however_ , that, after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which by law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto and specifically referencing this Agreement.

 

  SECTION 8.5 _Waiver_ . At any time prior to the Effective
Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the requirements of
applicable law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby
and specifically referencing this Agreement. The failure of any party to
assert any rights or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or
remedies.

obligations of the parties hereto (and of the Guarantor, the Parent Related
