ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

 Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and provided that this Agreement shall not have
been validly terminated pursuant to _______Article IX_ and that the Company
shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under
_______Section 1.2_, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in
no event more than twenty (20) Business Days thereafter), Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act) the Offer. In the Offer, each share of
Company Common Stock accepted by Purchaser in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer shall be exchanged for 1.103 shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent " _Parent Common Stock_
"), without interest (the " _Offer Consideration_ "), subject to the other
provisions of this  _Article_ __ _ I_. The Offer shall be made by means of
an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to
holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act and contains, to
the extent required by the Exchange Act, the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement (including _Annex C_ ). Each of Parent and Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof (including _Annex C_ ). The obligation of Purchaser to
accept for exchange (and the obligation of Parent to cause Purchaser to accept
for exchange) shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to:

(i) the condition that, prior to the expiration of the Offer, there have
been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms
of the Offer a number of shares of Company Common Stock that, upon the
consummation of the Offer (for the avoidance of doubt, assuming that shares of
Class B Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) will
convert into shares of Class A Common Stock upon the consummation of the
Offer), together with the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent
and Purchaser (if any) (excluding shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received,"
as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for
the Offer pursuant to such procedures), would represent at least a majority
of the aggregate voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately after the consummation of the Offer (the " _Minimum
Condition_ "); and

 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex C_.

 

(b) Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive or modify any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of, or conditions
to, the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, without the prior written consent of the Company in
its sole discretion, Purchaser may not (and Parent shall not permit Purchaser
to) (i) waive the Minimum Condition, or any of the conditions set forth in
_clauses_ _ (B)_, _(C)_ , _(D)_ , _(E)_ or _(F)(5)_ of _Annex C_ or (ii) make
any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the
form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (B) reduces the Offer
Consideration to be paid in the Offer or decreases the number of shares of
Company Common Stock sought in the Offer (other

 



-2- 

    

 than in each case an adjustment made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_),
(C) extends the Offer, other than in a manner required or permitted by 
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_, (D) imposes conditions to the Offer, other than those
set forth in _Annex C_ or (E) amends or modifies any term of or condition to
the Offer (including the conditions in _Annex_ _C_ ) in any manner that has
an adverse effect, or would be reasonably likely to have an adverse effect, on
the holders of Company Common Stock that is not _de minimis_.

 

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to the Offer, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (after aggregating all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock _multiplied
by_ the Parent Trading Price, rounded to the nearest whole cent.

 

(d) _Adjustments to Offer Consideration_. The Offer Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent
Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the
Acceptance Time. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_ shall be construed
to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(e) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_, the Offer shall expire at midnight, Eastern Time, on
the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (for this purpose calculated in
accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after the date the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer
is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer
shall expire on the date and at the time to which the Offer has been so
extended (the initial expiration date, or such subsequent time and date to
which the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance
with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)(i)_ or
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement (unless Parent receives
the prior written consent of the Company (which may be granted or withheld in
the CompanyÂ’s sole discretion)):

 

(A) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer
for any period required by any Law, or any rule, regulation, interpretation
or position of the SEC or its staff or of the NYSE, in any such case, which is
applicable to the Offer, or to the extent necessary to resolve any comments of
the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or the Offer Documents or the
Form S-4;

(B) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer (other than the
Minimum Condition, the condition set forth in clause (F)(3) of Annex C, and
other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
expiration of the Offer (provided such conditions would be capable of being
satisfied or validly waived were the expiration of the Offer to occur at such
time)) have not been satisfied or waived as of any then-scheduled expiration
of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten (10) Business
Days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed by Parent and the
Company); and

 

(C) if as of any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer each condition to
the Offer (other than the Minimum Condition, and other than any such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the

 



-3- 

    

 expiration of the Offer (provided such conditions would be capable of being
satisfied or validly waived were the expiration of the Offer to occur at such
time)) has been satisfied or waived and the Minimum Condition has not been
satisfied, Purchaser may, and, at the request in writing of the Company,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer for
successive extension periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each (with the
length of each such period being determined in good faith by Parent) (or for
such longer period as may be agreed by Parent and the Company in writing);
_provided_ , that in no event shall Purchaser or Parent be required to
(and Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser to) extend the
expiration of the Offer pursuant to this _clause (C)_ (i) if (x) the Minimum
Condition is not satisfied by a number of shares of Company Common Stock that
is equal to or less than the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock held or beneficially owned by any Stockholders (as defined in the Letter
Agreement) that have not been tendered, or have been tendered but validly
withdrawn, in the Offer as of such time and (y) as of such time the
Stockholders whose untendered shares of Company Common Stock are necessary to
satisfy the Minimum Condition are not using good faith and diligent efforts to
tender the necessary shares of Company Common Stock into the Offer, or (ii)
for more than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate;

_provided_ , __ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (1) any such extension shall not be deemed to impair, limit, or
otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and
(2) Purchaser shall not be required (and Parent shall not be required to cause
Purchaser) to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

 

(iii) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall extend the Offer or provide a
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in any manner other than in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company.

 

(iv) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer
prior to the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Article_ __ _ IX_, in which case
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one
(1) Business Day) after such termination of this Agreement.

(v) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status of the Offer, including with respect to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that have been validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer, and with respect
to any material developments with respect thereto and, upon the CompanyÂ’s
written request (no more often than once per day during the Offer (other than
on the date of the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer)), provide the
Company as soon as practicable with the most recent report then available from
the Exchange Agent detailing the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in accordance with
the terms of the Offer; _provided_ that ParentÂ’s obligations, actions or
inactions pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)(v)_ shall be deemed excluded
for purposes of determining whether Parent or the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_.

(f) _Payment for Company Common Stock_. On the terms of and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all shares
of Company Common Stock that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the expiration of the Offer (as it
may be extended in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)(ii)_) (or, at
ParentÂ’s election, concurrently with the expiration of the Offer if all
conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived) (such time of
acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a
timely basis the funds and shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to pay for
any shares of Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer. The consideration in the Offer payable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in
shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, if any), without interest and subject to reduction for
any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof.

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the Company or of Purchaser, subject to _Section_ __ _
1.1(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Cancelled Shares and any Converted Shares) shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive the Offer Consideration (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") in accordance with this  _Article_ __ _ III_. From and
after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
applicable portion of Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.2_,
including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such shares of
Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.1(a)_ (the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts,
if any, payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_.

 

(b) _Certain Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is owned or held in treasury by the Company or is owned by
Parent or Purchaser shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (collectively, the "
_Cancelled Shares_ "). At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
owned by any

  



-8- 

    

 direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Purchaser)
or of the Company (the " _Converted Shares_ ") shall be converted into such
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company (" _Surviving
Company_ _Stock_ ") equal to the product of (i) (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by such Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _divided by_  (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the total
number of shares of Surviving Company Stock outstanding immediately after the
consummation of the Merger.

 

(c) _Treatment of Purchaser Shares_. At the Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Shares_ ") shall be automatically converted into
and become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Surviving Company
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
Purchaser Shares shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of Surviving Company Stock into which they were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent
Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit
the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.2. _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company Stockholders for
the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At
or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock
issuable in book-entry form equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration
(excluding any Fractional Share Consideration) payable pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.1(a)_ and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount
sufficient to pay the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_, and any dividends or other distributions under _Section_
__ _ 3.2(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock and
cash amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_ and any dividends or other distributions under _Section_
__ _ 3.2(f)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the
shortfall that is required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the
Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, and any amounts payable in respect of
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_, out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion
of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash
shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by MoodyÂ’s
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankerÂ’s acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to Parent.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Company Common Stock Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") and whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration into which such shares of
Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, and any dividends or
other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_
__ _ III_, including any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, and
any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends
or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_ for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) so surrendered
shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid
or is not required to be paid.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of or non-certificated Company
Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book_ __ _-Entry Shares_ ") and
whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall not be required
to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each registered
holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the
Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_, including any Fractional Share
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, and any amounts that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_, for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Book-Entry Share, and
the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall be forthwith cancelled. Payment of
the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made
to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(iii) _No Interest_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of
the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_)
or in respect of any Book-Entry Share.

 



-10- 

    

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, each Certificate
and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this  _Article_ __ _ III_. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled
to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that
have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to
the Exchange AgentÂ’s routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable
Merger Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional
Share Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, and any dividends
or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_, payable upon due surrender of their Certificates (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
3.2(e)_) or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section_
__ _ 3.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Company, Purchaser, the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by Parent, an indemnity bond, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, including any amount payable
in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.5_, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_.

 

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case, until the surrender of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent,
an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement.
Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

Section 3.3. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (whether vested or unvested)
held by any former employee of the Company shall, in each case, without any
action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled,
with the holder of such Company Option becoming entitled to receive within
five (5) Business Days, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect thereto, the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net Share
covered by such Company Option, less applicable Tax withholdings.

 



-11- 

    

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than a Company
Option covered by _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_) shall, without any action on the
part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, cease to represent a
right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be assumed and
converted automatically into an option to purchase the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") equal to the product
obtained by  _multiplying_ (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_
(y) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest
whole share. Each Adjusted Option shall have an exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock equal to (i) the per share exercise price for shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the corresponding Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent. Each Adjusted Option shall otherwise be subject to
the same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company Option
under the applicable Company Equity Plan and the agreement evidencing the
grant thereunder, including vesting terms.

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a non-employee
director of the Company will vest as of the Effective Time and shall, without
any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be
cancelled, with the holder of such Company RSU becoming entitled to receive
within five (5) Business Days (or such later date required by Section 409A of
the Code), in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU (other than any Company RSU
covered by  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_) that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or the holder thereof, be assumed and converted automatically into a
restricted stock unit with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (each, an " _Adjusted RSU_ ") equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time _by_ (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share.
Each Adjusted RSU shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
applicable to the corresponding Company RSU under the applicable Company
Equity Plan and the agreement evidencing the grant thereunder, including
vesting terms.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent,
the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed and converted automatically into
an Adjusted RSU with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_  (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time _by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares
rounded to the nearest whole share. For purposes of  _clause (i)_ of the
immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to a Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time shall equal
the number of Company PSUs that would have vested based on the achievement of
performance at target levels. Each Adjusted RSU shall otherwise be subject to
the same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company PSU
under the applicable Company Equity Plan and the agreement evidencing the
grant thereunder, including vesting terms, except that such Adjusted RSU
shall vest based on continued service to Parent and its affiliates through the
last day of the applicable service vesting period (subject to any accelerated
vesting provided for in the award agreement applicable to the corresponding
Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time).

(f) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall
take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to
provide that: (i) with respect to any offering periods in effect as of the
date hereof (the " _Current ESPP Offering Periods_ "), no employee who is not
a participant in the Company ESPP as of the date hereof may become a
participant in the Company ESPP and no participant may increase the percentage
amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on the
date hereof for such Current

 



-12- 

    

 ESPP Offering Periods; (ii) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the
Company ESPP shall terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time; (iii) if the Current ESPP Offering Periods terminate prior to the
Effective Time, then the Company ESPP shall be suspended and no new offering
period shall be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of
this Agreement; and (iv) if any Current ESPP Offering Period is still in
effect at the Effective Time, then the last day of such Current ESPP Offering
Period shall be accelerated to a date prior to the Closing Date as specified
by the Company Board of Directors in accordance with Section 11(b) of the
Company ESPP.

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions as
are necessary for the treatment of the Company Equity Awards and the Company
ESPP as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_.

 

(h) Parent shall file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, one or more appropriate registration statements (on Form
S-3 or Form S-8, or any successor or other appropriate forms) relating to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Adjusted Options
and Adjusted RSUs. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or statements for so
long as Adjusted Options and Adjusted RSUs remain outstanding and shall
reserve a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance
upon exercise or settlement thereof.

 

Section 3.4. _Withholding_. Each of the Company, Parent, Purchaser,
the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts
as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such payment under
the Code, or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Tax Law and treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

Section 3.5. _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares
represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount
equal to such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock _multiplied by_ the
Parent Trading Price, rounded to the nearest whole cent.

Section 3.6. _Tax Treatment_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the Offer and the Merger, taken together, will qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g)
and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

provided or given any payment or thing of value to any Person for the purpose

and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, in each case in effect at the
time of such filing, and fairly present in all material respects the

results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited quarterly
financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and any other
adjustment described therein permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC
and to the absence of notes) in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (subject, in the case of the unaudited
quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and any
other adjustment described therein permitted by the rules and regulations
of the SEC and to the absence of notes).

(c) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended. Each required form,
report and document containing financial statements that has been filed with
or submitted to the SEC was accompanied by any certifications required to be
filed or submitted by ParentÂ’s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of
filing or submission of each such certification, such certification complied
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley

of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. ParentÂ’s disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
ParentÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding

financial reporting, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the CompanyÂ’s
internal controls over financial reporting and (iii) any written claim or
allegation regarding clauses (i) or (ii). Since January 31, 2016 through the

liabilities incurred or which have been discharged or paid in full, in each
case, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since

the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges
that, except as may be expressly provided in _Article IV_ , no representations
or warranties are made with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates,
budgets or prospective information that may have been made available, directly

to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries, and its and their respective officers and directors

Company SubsidiariesÂ’ other Representatives to not, directly or indirectly:
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way

the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the then-scheduled expiration of the
Offer); (vi) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule
14D-9; (vii) approve, or authorize, or cause or permit the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to enter into, any merger agreement, acquisition agreement,

-44- 

    

 document with respect to, or any other agreement or commitment providing
for, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_) (a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), (viii) call or convene a meeting of the
Company Stockholders to consider a proposal that would reasonably be expected
to materially impair, prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions
or (ix) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (any act described in
_clauses_ __ _ (iii)_, _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ or _(ix)_ (to the extent
related to the foregoing _clauses_ __ _ (iii)_, _(iv)_ or _(v)_ ), a "
_Change of Recommendation_ "). The Company shall, and the Company shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries, and its and their respective officers and directors
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and the Company
SubsidiariesÂ’ other Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing
solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any persons (or provision of
any nonpublic information to any persons) with respect to any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal. Promptly after the date hereof (and in any event
within two (2) Business Day following the date hereof), the Company shall (A)
request in writing that each person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal promptly destroy or
return to the Company all nonpublic information heretofore furnished by the
Company or any of its Representatives to such person or any of its
Representatives in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement
and (B) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to
a possible Acquisition Proposal by such person and its Representatives. The
Company shall enforce, and not waive, terminate or modify without ParentÂ’s
prior written consent, any confidentiality, standstill or similar provision
in any confidentiality, standstill or other agreement; _provided_ that, if the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel that the failure to waive a particular
standstill provision would be reasonably likely to violate the directorsÂ’
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may, with prior written
notice to Parent, waive such standstill solely to the extent necessary to
permit the applicable person (if it has not been solicited in violation of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_) to make, on a confidential basis to the Company
Board of Directors, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such person
agreeing to disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent, in each case as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
6.3_, the term " _person_ " means any Person or "group," as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the Company,
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their Representatives.
Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.3(a), if the Company
receives, prior to the Acceptance Time, a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the CompanyÂ’s Representatives may
contact the Person or any of its Representatives who has made such Acquisition
Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal so that the Company may inform itself about such Acquisition
Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ by (x) a Company Subsidiary, (y) a
director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (z) any other
Representatives acting on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ by the Company.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_,
if the Company receives, prior to the Acceptance Time, an unsolicited, bona
fide, written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, which the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel and
financial advisors (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and, in each case,
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate
the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then in either event the
Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information with
respect to the Company to the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the
Company receives from such person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and the Company also provides Parent, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time such information is provided or made available to
such person, any nonpublic information furnished to such other person that was
not previously furnished to Parent, and (y) engage in discussions
or negotiations with such person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.

 



-45- 

    

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent of the CompanyÂ’s or any of its controlled affiliatesÂ’ or
its or their respective RepresentativesÂ’ receipt of any Acquisition Proposal,
any proposals or inquiries that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any person who has made
or would reasonably be expected to make any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice
shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request, and the material terms and conditions of any such proposal
or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry
or request, including unredacted copies of all proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements received by the Company relating to such Acquisition
Proposal or, if such Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a reasonably
detailed written description of the material terms and conditions thereof.
Without limiting the CompanyÂ’s other obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.3_, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely
basis of the status and material terms (including any amendments or proposed
amendments to such material terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or
potential Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt
and timely basis as to the nature of any information requested of the Company
with respect thereto and provide to Parent copies of all proposals, offers and
proposed agreements relating to an Acquisition Proposal received by the
Company, or, if such information or communication is not in writing, a
reasonably detailed written description of the material contents thereof.
Without limiting the CompanyÂ’s other obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.3_, the Company shall promptly provide (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) to Parent any material nonpublic information concerning the
Company provided to any other person in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours after such determination) inform Parent in writing if the Company
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
6.3(b)_. Unless this Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_, the Company shall not take any action to exempt any
person other than Parent or Purchaser from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in any applicable Takeover Statute or in the Company
Governing Documents, or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply. The
Company agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any
agreement with any person which directly or indirectly prohibits the Company
from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise
complying with, this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ to the contrary,
but subject to  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company Board of Directors may (i) make a Change of Recommendation
(only of the type contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)(iv)_ or  _Section_
__ _ 6.3(a)(vi)_) in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to violate the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or (ii) make a Change of Recommendation and cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(g)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, did not result from a breach of  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_), which the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors is a Superior
Proposal, but only if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel and
financial advisors that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely
to violate the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement
unless this Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(g)_. " _Intervening Event_ " means any Effect that is
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and
was not known by or reasonably foreseeable to the Company or the Company
Board of Directors as of or prior to the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the following events, changes or developments
constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt, existence or terms of
an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence
thereof, (B) changes in the market price or trading volume of the Class A
Common Stock, the Parent Common Stock or any other securities of the Company,
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, or any change in credit rating or
the fact that the Company meets or exceeds (or that Parent fails to meet or
exceed)

 



-46- 

    

 internal or published estimates, projections, forecasts or predictions for
any period, (C) changes in general economic, political or financial conditions
or markets (including changes in interest rates, exchange rates, stock, bond
or debt prices) or (D) changes in GAAP, other applicable accounting rules or
applicable Law or, in any such case, changes in the interpretation thereof.

 

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section_ __
_ 6.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) Business DaysÂ’
prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to effect
a Change of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
therefor, and during such four (4) Business Day period, the Company shall
procure that its Representatives (including its executive officers) negotiate
in good faith (solely to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any proposal
by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner
that would obviate the need to effect a Change of Recommendation and at the
end of such four (4) Business Day period the Company Board of Directors again
makes the determination under  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)(i)_ (after in good
faith taking into account any amendments proposed by Parent) or (ii) under
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)(ii)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4)
Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of
Directors intends to take such action and specifying the material terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of any proposed
definitive documentation, and during such four (4) Business Day period, the
Company shall procure that its Representatives (including its executive
officers) negotiate in good faith (solely to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal and at the end of such four (4) Business Day period the
Company Board of Directors again makes the determination under  _Section_ __
_ 6.3(d)(ii)_ (after in good faith taking into account the amendments
proposed by Parent). With respect to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)(ii)_, if there are
any material amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such
Superior Proposal (including any revision to the amount, form or mix of
consideration the Company Stockholders would receive as a result of the
Superior Proposal), the Company shall notify Parent of each such amendment,
revision or change in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ and the
applicable four (4) Business Day period shall be extended until at least three
(3) Business Days after the time that Parent receives notification from the
Company of each such revision, and the Company Board of Directors shall not
take any such action permitted under _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)(ii)_ prior to the
end of any such period as so extended in accordance with the terms of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Company Stockholders a
position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any "stop, look and
listen" communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any legally required
disclosure to the Company Stockholders with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
which actions, in the case of clauses (i)-(iii), shall not constitute or be
deemed to constitute a Change of Recommendation so long as any
such disclosure (x) includes an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation, without any amendment, withdrawal, alteration, modification or
qualification thereof and (y) does not include any statement that constitutes,
and does not otherwise constitute, a Change of Recommendation. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(f)_ shall not permit the Company
Board of Directors to make (or otherwise modify the definition of) a Change
of Recommendation except to the extent expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _
6.3(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 Section 7.1. _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to

 shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and
ParentÂ’s Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice to the CompanyÂ’s and the Company SubsidiariesÂ’
offices, properties, Contracts, personnel, books and records (so long as any
such access does not unreasonably interfere with the CompanyÂ’s business), and
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to furnish as promptly as
practicable to Parent all information (financial or otherwise) concerning its
business, properties, offices, Contracts and personnel as Parent
may reasonably request (including information for purposes of transition and
integration planning). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
required by this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ to provide Parent or
ParentÂ’s Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i) that
is prohibited from being disclosed pursuant to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date hereof or after
the date hereof in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, at ParentÂ’s written request, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (x) to obtain the
required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure or (y) to
make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access or
disclosure not in violation of such consent requirement), (ii) the disclosure
of which, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, would violate
applicable Law ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Law) or (iii) the
disclosure of which, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company,
would cause the loss of any attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to
the maximum extent that such access or disclosure would not jeopardize
attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege).

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any information exchanged pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, in confidence to the extent required by and in
accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt written notice to the Company (solely with respect to the matters set
forth in _clauses_ _(i)_ and _(ii)_ and subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_),

Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Letter
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Letter Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Letter Agreement, (ii) of any legal proceeding commenced or, to such PartyÂ’s
Knowledge, threatened against such Party or any of its Subsidiaries,

affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors or
officers, in each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating
to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement or the Letter Agreement, and (iii) upon becoming aware of the
occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it
or any Company Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or which
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ shall not cure any
breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter
prior to the date hereof or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to Parent and Purchaser; _provided_ , _further_ , that the CompanyÂ’s
obligations, actions or inactions pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_, in
each case in and of themselves, shall be deemed excluded for purposes of
determining whether the condition set forth in _clause (F)(2)_ of _Annex B_
has been satisfied.

 

Section 7.2. _Reasonable Best Efforts._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i)
preparing and filing or otherwise providing, in consultation with

 the other Party and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date
hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions, filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as

may be necessary, subject to the limitations in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, to
obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders
and approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
Party agrees to (x) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the
execution of this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed between
the Parties), and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and
advisable any additional information and documentary materials that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act as soon as reasonably practicable and (y) make all other
necessary filings as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,
and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any
additional information and documentary materials that may be requested under
any Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to, and the Company may not and may not permit any
Subsidiary to, without the prior written consent of Parent, become subject to,
consent to or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect
to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
to (A) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of any assets, business or portion of business of the Company,
the Surviving Company, Parent, Purchaser or any Subsidiary of any of the

manner or (C) impose any restriction, requirement or limitation on the
operation of the business or portion of the business of the Company, the
Surviving Company, Parent, Purchaser or any Subsidiary of any of the
foregoing; _provided_ that if requested by Parent, the Company or its
Subsidiaries will become subject to, consent to or offer or agree to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on
the Company or its Subsidiaries in the event the Closing occurs.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with obtaining all
waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations for the
Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law contemplated by

(i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other

allowing the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance
and comment on drafts of filings and submissions and reasonably considering in
good faith comments of the other Party, (ii) promptly inform the other Party
of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity, by
promptly providing copies to the other Party of any such written
communications, and of any communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
Transactions and (iii) permit the other Party to review in advance any
communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or

other Governmental Entity or other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials required to be provided pursuant to the foregoing _clauses_ __ _
(i)_- _(iii)_ may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the
valuation of Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (C) as necessary to

_further_ , __

 



-49- 

    

  __that each of Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material" which such material and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Parent on the one hand or the Company on the other) or its
legal counsel.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, and shall cooperate in good faith with one another to, identify
any third party consents (or notices) under any Contracts of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary that are necessary or desirable for the consummation of the
Transactions. The Company shall, and shall cause any applicable Company
Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such third-
party consent (or deliver any such notices) in the event that Parent requests
the Company to do so; _provided_ , _however_ , each of the
parties acknowledges and agrees that obtaining any such consent or approval
shall not, in and of itself, be a condition to the Offer or the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any consent
or other similar fee, payment or consideration, make any other concession or
provide any additional security (including a guaranty), to obtain such third
party consents (except, in the case of the Company, if requested by Parent
and either (a) reimbursed or indemnified for by Parent or (b) subject to the
occurrence of the Acceptance Time).

 

Section 7.3. _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement or
disclosure with respect to the Offer, the Merger, the other Transactions or
this Agreement or the Letter Agreement without the prior written consent of
the other Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside
counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement
with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market
to issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement or disclosure with respect to the Offer, the Merger, the other
Transactions or this Agreement or the Letter Agreement, in which event such
Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to
provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon
such press release or other announcement or disclosure in advance and shall
give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties shall not be
required by this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ to provide any such review or comment to
the other Party relating to any dispute between the Parties relating to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that each Party and their respective
Subsidiaries and Representatives may make statements that are consistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent or the Company in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_; _provided,
further_ , that the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall
not apply to any communication regarding an Acquisition Proposal or a Change
of Recommendation.

 

Section 7.4. _D andO Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses prior to the final
disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents; _provided_ that such
Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a court
of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, nonappealable judgment that
such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding
in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, 

 



-50- 

    

 in connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director, employee or
other fiduciary of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or of any other
Person if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
and the Company Governing Documents or the organizational documents of the
applicable Company Subsidiary (as applicable) or any indemnification
agreements with such Persons in existence on the date of this Agreement and
provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that
all rights to elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement
of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
provided in the CompanyÂ’s or its SubsidiariesÂ’ respective certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any
indemnification agreement of the Company or a Company Subsidiary with any
Indemnified Party in existence on the date of this Agreement and provided to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement shall survive the Transactions,
including the Merger, and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with the terms thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies the Surviving Company on or prior
to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of
which such Person intends in good faith to seek indemnification pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall
continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of
all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents and
(ii) any indemnification agreement of the Company or a Company Subsidiary with
any Indemnified Party in existence on the date of this Agreement and provided
to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, except to the extent that such
agreement provides for an earlier termination, in each case, regarding
elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and
employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date
hereof, and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged
to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions).

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a
six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing coverage
retentions, limits and other material terms substantially equivalent to the
current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not commit or spend on
such "tail" policy, in the aggregate, more than three hundred percent (300%)
of the last aggregate annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof for the CompanyÂ’s current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Base Amount_
"), and if the cost of such "tail" policy would otherwise exceed the Base
Amount, the Company shall be permitted to purchase only as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for the Base Amount. The Company shall in good faith
cooperate with Parent prior to the Acceptance Time with respect to the
procurement of such "tail" policy, including with respect to the selection of
the broker, available policy price and coverage options.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_. The rights and obligations under this _Section_
__ _ 7.4_ shall survive consummation of the Offer and the Merger and shall
not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified
Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, each of whom may enforce the
provisions thereof.

 



-51- 

    

Section 7.5. _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Letter Agreement)
and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the
foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Letter
Agreement) may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Letter Agreement).
No Change of Recommendation shall change, or be deemed to change, or permit
the Company or the Company Board of Directors to change, in any manner or
respect, the approval of the Company Board of Directors for purposes of
causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the Merger or any of the
other Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Letter
Agreement).

 

Section 7.6. _Obligations of Purchaser_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Purchaser and the Surviving Company to perform
their obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any
violation of the obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement shall also be
deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Parent.

 

Section 7.7. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall assume, honor and fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans
in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date
hereof or as subsequently amended or terminated as permitted pursuant to the
terms of such Company Benefit Plans and this Agreement. Effective as of the
Effective Time and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Parent
shall provide to each employee of the Company and Company Subsidiary who
continues to be employed by Parent or any Subsidiary thereof (the "
_Continuing Employees_ "), (i) at least the same wage rate or base salary
as in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing,
and (ii) employee benefits (including cash bonus opportunities, retirement,
health and welfare benefits, but excluding equity incentive compensation) that
are, in the aggregate, in ParentÂ’s discretion, either (A) no less favorable
to such Continuing Employee than those in effect for such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing or (B) no less favorable than those in effect
for similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall, subject
to applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent
as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is of the same type as the Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)(A) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee, Parent or its applicable Subsidiary shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
were not waived under the Old Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) Parent and its
applicable Subsidiary shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employeeÂ’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into

 



-52- 

    

 account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible and
maximum out-of- pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) If, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Parent
provides written notice to the Company directing the Company to terminate its
401(k) plan(s), the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans effective
as of the day immediately preceding the day on which the Effective Time occurs
(the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). In the event that Parent requests that
such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution
of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the day on which the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ that, prior to amending
or terminating the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) plan, the Company shall provide Parent
with the form and substance of any applicable resolutions or amendments for
review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If the Company 401(k) plan is terminated pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.7(c)_, then as soon as practicable following the
401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall permit all Continuing Employees who were
eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) plan immediately prior to the
401(k) Termination Date to participate in ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan and shall
permit each such Continuing Employee to elect to transfer his or her account
balance when distributed from the terminated Company 401(k) plan, including
any outstanding participant loans, to ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan, except to the
extent accepting such transfers would adversely affect the tax-qualified
status of ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan or as may be prohibited by ParentÂ’s 401(k)
plan.

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent or
any affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent
expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the
Company or any affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any
severance, benefit or other applicable plan or program covering such
Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall (i) be deemed or
construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit
Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent or Purchaser or (ii) create any third
party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its
affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

Section 7.8. _Rule_ __ _  16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and Parent shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of
Parent equity securities pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who
is a director or officer of the Company subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule  16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.9. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder of the Company or
purported stockholder of the Company against the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions or this Agreement or the
Letter Agreement, and shall keep Parent informed on a prompt and timely basis
with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate (at ParentÂ’s expense) in the defense or
settlement of any such litigation and reasonably cooperate with Parent in
conducting the defense or settlement of such litigation, and no such
settlement shall be agreed without ParentÂ’s prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Parent may,
in its sole discretion, withhold such consent to any settlement which does not
include a full release of Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries) or which imposes an injunction or other
equitable relief after the Effective Time upon Parent or any of its affiliates
(including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries). In the event of, and
to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.9_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ shall control.

 



-53- 

    

Section 7.10. _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with
the other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Class A Common Stock from the NYSE and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall
not be effective until at or after the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.11. _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations
executed by each director of the Company in office as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and effective upon the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.12. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Offer and the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance.

 

Section 7.13. _14d-10 Matters_. The Parties acknowledge that certain
payments have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been
granted or are to be granted according to employment compensation, severance
and other employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Company
Benefit Plans (collectively, the " _Arrangements_ "), to certain holders of
Company Common Stock and holders of Company Equity Awards. The Compensation
Committee of the Company Board of Directors (the " _Company Compensation
Committee_ ") (a) at a meeting to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, has
duly adopted or will duly adopt resolutions approving as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act (i) each Arrangement
effective on or prior to the date hereof or entered into after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.4_
and _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ and (b) will take all other actions necessary to
satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, including with respect to the foregoing
arrangements and any other applicable transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company represents and warrants that each member of the
Company Compensation Committee is an "independent director" in accordance with
the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.14. _Certain Tax Matters_. None of the Parties shall (and
each Party shall cause its respective Subsidiaries not to) knowingly take any
action (or knowingly fail to take any reasonable action) which action (or
failure to act) would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Offer
and the Merger, taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties intend to report and,
except to the extent otherwise required by a determination as such term is
used in Section 1313 of the Code, shall report, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Offer and the Merger, taken together, as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to deliver to
ParentÂ’s and the CompanyÂ’s tax counsel and tax advisors a certificate signed
by an officer of Parent (and Purchaser) or the Company, as applicable,
containing representations reasonably satisfactory to such counsel or
advisors in connection with the rendering of any tax opinions to be issued by
such counsel or advisors with respect to the treatment of the Offer and the
Merger, taken together, as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and ParentÂ’s and the CompanyÂ’s tax counsel and tax
advisors shall be entitled to rely upon such representations in rendering any
such opinions.

 

Section 7.15. _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. If and to the extent
any Stockholder (as defined in the Letter Agreement) delivers to the Company
or the CompanyÂ’s transfer agent documentation to convert shares of Class B
Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Letter
Agreement, the Company shall promptly take all actions within its control to
effect such conversion. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall
cooperate to implement the terms of the Letter Agreement, including with
respect to the delivery of an "Irrevocable Conversion Notice" pursuant to
Section 1.3 thereof and the conversion of "Subject Shares" pursuant to Section
1.2 thereof, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Letter
Agreement.

 ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION

 

Section 9.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned at any time
before the Acceptance Time, as follows (with any termination by Parent also
being an effective termination by Purchaser):

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company is not then in
material breach of this Agreement such that the conditions to the Offer set
forth in _clauses_ __ _ (F)(1)_ or _(F)(2)_ of _Annex C_ would not then be
satisfied if the Expiration Date were the date of the termination pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ and (ii) (A) Parent or Purchaser shall have
breached, failed to perform or violated their respective covenants or
agreements under this Agreement, which breach, failure to perform or violation

effect to any qualification as to materiality or Parent Material Adverse
Effect contained therein) would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, and in each of _clauses_ __ _ (A)_ and _(B)_ such
breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy is not capable of being
cured by the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured by the Outside Date,
is not cured by Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, before the earlier of (x)
the Business Day immediately prior to the Outside Date and (y) the thirtieth

failed to perform or violated its covenants or agreements under this Agreement
or (B) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in

Purchaser not to accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to  _clauses_ _ (F)(1)_ or _(F)(2)_ of _Annex C_ (assuming
the expiration of the Offer as of such time) and such breach, failure to
perform, violation or inaccuracy is not capable of being cured by the Outside

Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer;  _provided_ that (A) the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_ shall not
be available to Parent if Parent or Purchaser shall have failed to comply in
any material respect with its respective obligations under _Section_ __ _
1.1(e)(ii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.1(f)_ and (B) __ the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(i)_ shall not be
available to the Company if the Company shall have failed to comply in any
material respect with its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ and _Section_
__ _ 6.3_; or (ii) if the Acceptance Time has not occurred on or before
October 9, 2019 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ that (A) if, on the
Outside Date, all of the conditions to the Offer, other than the conditions
set forth in _clauses (B)_ and  _(C)_ (to the extent any such injunction or
order is in respect of, or any such Law is, the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Law) of _Annex C_ and those conditions to the Offer that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer (if such conditions (other
than the Minimum Condition) would be satisfied or validly waived were the
expiration of the Offer to occur at such time), shall have been satisfied or
waived, then the Outside Date shall automatically be extended for all
purposes hereunder to January 9, 2020 and (B) the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be available

(ii) If (A) (x) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(e)(i)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)(ii)_ or (y) the Company terminates this

after such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

(iii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.1(g)_, concurrently with or prior to (and as a condition to) such
termination, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

 

(iv) In the event any amount is payable by the Company pursuant to the
preceding  _clauses_ __ _ (i)_, _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , such amount shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 9.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, the Parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. Each Party
further acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Purchaser in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, if the Company fails to pay
in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, then
(i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including disbursements and fees of outside legal counsel)
incurred in the collection of such overdue amounts, including in
connection with any related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii)
the Company shall pay to Parent interest on the amounts payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ from and including the date payment of such amounts
were due but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth
in the _Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except
for the right to seek monetary damages for fraud (solely as it relates to the
representations and warranties expressly made in _Article IV_ ) or willful
breach occurring prior to the valid termination of this Agreement, and without
limiting ParentÂ’s or PurchaserÂ’s right to specific performance in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, (A) the Termination Fee (and any other amounts
expressly contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_, if any) shall be
the sole and exclusive monetary remedy available to Parent and Purchaser in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions in any circumstance in
which the Termination Fee becomes due and payable and is paid by the Company
in accordance with this Agreement, and (B) upon ParentÂ’s receipt of the full
Termination Fee (and any

 



-57- 

    

 other amounts contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_, if any) pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ in circumstances in which the Termination Fee
is payable, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may seek specific performance
to cause the Company to consummate the Transactions in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 10.12_ or the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_, but in no event shall Parent be entitled to both (i)
specific performance to cause the Company to consummate the Transactions in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.12 _and (ii) the payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_.

Section 10.5. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to sections, such reference shall be to a section of this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The word
"extent" and the phrase "to the extent" when used in this Agreement shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other things extends, and such word or
phrase shall not merely mean "if." The term "or" is not exclusive, and shall
be interpreted as "and/or." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the
date hereof," "of even date herewith" and terms of similar import, shall be
deemed to refer to the date set forth in the preamble to this Agreement. The
table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement or any schedule
delivered pursuant to this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes
only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement or such schedule or any term or provision
hereof or thereof. All references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall
be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person,
unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. A reference to
any specific Law or to any provision of any Law, whether or not followed by
the phrase "as amended," includes any amendment to, and any modification, re-
enactment or successor thereof, any legislative provision substituted therefor
and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued thereunder or
pursuant thereto, except that, for purposes of any representations and
warranties in this Agreement that are made as a specific date, references to
any specific Law will be deemed to refer to such legislation or provision (and
all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued thereunder
or pursuant thereto) as of such date. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

Section 10.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or
by other electronic transmission by the Parties, in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by
each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic
transmission in .pdf or DocuSign format shall be sufficient to bind the
Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

Section 10.7. _Entire Agreement; Third_ __ _-Party Beneficiaries_.

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended hereby so that until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, Parent
and Purchaser shall be permitted to take the actions contemplated by this
Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or
any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

(b) Except as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, nothing in this Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) or
in the Confidentiality Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder or
thereunder.

 

Section 10.8. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Offer and the Merger is not affected in any manner
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 10.9. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state.

 

(b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court
finds it lacks jurisdiction, the federal court of the United States of America
sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding, except in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks
jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof; (ii) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court
finds it lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof; (iii) waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in such courts; and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action
or proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by applicable Law. Each Party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in

 



-60- 

    

 this _Section_ __ _ 10.9(b)_ in the manner provided for notices in
_Section_ __ _ 10.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.

 

Section 10.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THE OFFER, THE MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 10.10_.

 

Section 10.11. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any
of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, but
without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 10.12. _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon
such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury, for which monetary damages
(even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, will occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Offer, the Merger or
the other Transactions) is not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or is otherwise breached. Accordingly, it is agreed that each Party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, a decree
or order of specific performance specifically enforcing the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and any further equitable relief, in each case in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.9_, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which such Party entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law
or in equity.

(c) The PartiesÂ’ rights in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ are an integral part
of the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ (including any objection on the
basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the
avoidance of doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at
Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks
any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, such Party shall not be
required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

As a holder of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (" _Class_ __
_ B Common Stock_"), of Tableau Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
" _Company_ "), the undersigned (each, a " _Stockholder_ ") understands that
the Company, salesforce.com, inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and
Sausalito Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), are
concurrently entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June
9, 2019 (as it may be from time to time amended, the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
which was previously approved by the boards of directors of the Company and
Parent, providing for, among other things, (i) the commencement by Purchaser
of the Offer and (ii) following the consummation of the Offer, the merger of
Purchaser with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
entity of the merger (the " _Merger_ "), in each case, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Terms used
without definition in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto
in the Merger Agreement.

Each Stockholder acknowledges that, as an inducement for Parent and Purchaser
to enter into the Merger Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser has required
that such Stockholder enter into this letter agreement (this " _Agreement_ ")
and such Stockholder is willing to enter into this Agreement.

Each Stockholder confirms such StockholderÂ’s agreement with Parent and
Purchaser, and each of Parent and Purchaser confirms its agreement with each
Stockholder, as follows:

1.1. _Subject Shares_. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Subject
Shares_ " means the shares of Class B Common Stock that such Stockholder owns
of record or beneficially (including through trusts or Affiliates) as of the
date of this Agreement and any shares of Class B Common Stock of which such
Stockholder (including through trusts or Affiliates) acquires record or
beneficial ownership after the date hereof and prior to the termination of
this Agreement. In the event of any stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend, merger, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or the like of the capital
stock of the Company affecting a StockholderÂ’s Subject Shares, the terms of
this Agreement shall apply to the resulting securities.

1.2. _Conditional Commitment to Convert_. Subject to receipt of an
Irrevocable Conversion Notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
each Stockholder shall promptly (but in no event later than one (1) hour after
receipt of the Irrevocable Conversion Notice) and irrevocably convert, and
shall deliver to the Company, the CompanyÂ’s transfer agent and Parent all
documentation reasonably necessary (including a conversion notice
substantially in a form attached as _Annex I_ hereto, the " _Conversion
Document_ ") to irrevocably convert, pursuant

 



B-2

    

 to and in accordance with the terms of Section D.5.a of Article IV of the
Company Certificate, each Subject Share into one fully paid and nonassessable
share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (" _Class_ __ _ A
Common Stock_"), it being understood that such StockholderÂ’s irrevocable
election to convert shall be deemed to be effective immediately upon the
delivery of the Conversion Document to the CompanyÂ’s transfer agent. The
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ shall have no further force or effect
in the event this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 1.10_.

1.3. _Irrevocable Conversion Notice_. For purposes hereof, an "
_Irrevocable Conversion Notice_ " means an irrevocable written notice
substantially in the form attached as _Annex II_ hereto, delivered by Parent
to each Stockholder on the date of the expiration of the Offer (as soon as
practicable following 10:00 a.m. New York City time but in no event later than
5:00 p.m. New York City time), specifying that all of the conditions to the
Offer have been either satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer, each of which
would be capable of being satisfied were the expiration of the Offer to occur
at the time Parent delivers an Irrevocable Conversion Notice to each
Stockholder) or irrevocably waived by Parent and Purchaser, it being
acknowledged and agreed that such irrevocable written notice can only be
validly delivered by Parent to the extent that all of the conditions to the
Offer have, in fact, been satisfied (or would be capable of being satisfied
were the expiration of the Offer to occur at the time Parent delivers an
Irrevocable Conversion Notice to each Stockholder) or otherwise irrevocably
waived by Parent and Purchaser; _provided_ , that, for purposes of the
Irrevocable Conversion Notice only, the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition
shall be tested assuming that all Subject Shares of all Stockholders to be
converted into shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_
are tendered prior to the expiration of the Offer and that the consummation
of the Offer occurs contemporaneously with the delivery of the Irrevocable
Conversion Notice. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Irrevocable
Conversion Notice may be delivered to each Stockholder by electronic mail to
the email address contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ and such Irrevocable
Conversion Notice shall be deemed given to such Stockholder if sent by
electronic mail to (x) the email address of such Stockholder in _Section_ __
_ 1.11_ (notice deemed given upon transmission if such email is sent by 5:00
p.m. New York City time, or, if after, the day following the date of
transmission) and (y) the email addresses of the individuals from Cooley LLP
listed in Section 10.4 of the Merger Agreement.

 

1.4. _Conditional Obligation_. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate
Parent or Purchaser to deliver an Irrevocable Conversion Notice.

1.5. _Representations and Warranties of the Stockholders_.
Each Stockholder represents and warrants that:

(a) such Stockholder, and (if such Stockholder is married and any of
such StockholderÂ’s Subject Shares constitute community property or otherwise
need spousal or other approval for this Agreement to be legal, valid and
binding) such StockholderÂ’s spouse, have duly executed and delivered this
Agreement and have all authority and full legal capacity to enter into this
Agreement and to perform his or her obligations under this Agreement;

 

(b) assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Purchaser, this Agreement is such StockholderÂ’s valid
and binding agreement and is enforceable against such Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations;

 



B-3

    

(c) the Subject Shares are owned by such Stockholder free and clear of all
encumbrances, voting arrangements and any other commitments or restrictions of
every kind, except as would not restrict the performance of such StockholderÂ’s
obligations under this Agreement;

 

(d) such Stockholder has the sole or shared power to vote or direct the
vote and to dispose of all Subject Shares;

 

(e) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder does
not, and the performance of such StockholderÂ’s obligations under this
Agreement as contemplated hereby will not: (i) conflict with or violate any
Law applicable to such Stockholder or by which the Subject Shares are bound or
affected; (ii) result in any breach of or violation of, or constitute a
default, or require any consent (or give rise to any right of termination or
acceleration or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would
become a default or give rise to any such right) under, any Contract to which
such Stockholder is a party or by which such Stockholder or the Subject Shares
are bound; or (iii) require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or filing with or notification to, any court or arbitrator or
any governmental entity, agency or official except for (A) applicable
requirements, if any, of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
(B) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not prevent or
impair the performance by such Stockholder of his obligations under this
Agreement;

 

(f) with respect to such Stockholder, as of the date hereof, there is no
Proceeding pending against, or, to the actual knowledge of such Stockholder,
threatened against such Stockholder or any of such StockholderÂ’s properties or
assets (including any of such StockholderÂ’s Subject Shares) before or by any
Governmental Entity that could reasonably be expected to prevent the
consummation by such Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise materially impair such StockholderÂ’s ability to perform
its obligations hereunder; and

 

(g) no broker, finder, financial advisor, investment banker or other Person
is entitled to any brokerage, finderÂ’s, financial advisorÂ’s or other similar
fee or commission from Parent, Purchaser or the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of such Stockholder.

 

1.6. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Purchaser_. Each of
Parent and Purchaser has all requisite entity power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent and Purchaser have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary entity action on the part of each of Parent and Purchaser, and no
other entity proceedings on the part of Parent and Purchaser are necessary to
authorize this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by each Stockholder, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against each
of Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Limitations.

 



B-4

    

1.7. _Covenants of the Stockholders_.

 

(a) Each Stockholder covenants and agrees that such Stockholder shall not,
directly or indirectly, take any action that is intended, or would reasonably
be expected, to materially interfere with, materially delay, or prevent the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions or this
Agreement or the performance by the Company of its obligations under the
Merger Agreement or by any Stockholder of its obligations under this
Agreement.

(b) From the date of this Agreement and until the termination of this
Agreement, and without limiting any provision of the Merger Agreement in any
respect, each Stockholder shall not: (i) continue any solicitation, knowing
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be
ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser or any of their Representatives)
any non-public information in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly
encouraging or knowingly facilitating, an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal
or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal; (iv) recommend any other holder of Company Common Stock to not
tender shares of Company Common Stock into the Offer; or (v) support,
recommend, endorse or approve any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
letter of intent, support agreement or similar commitment relating to or
facilitating an Acquisition Proposal. The foregoing notwithstanding, nothing
in this Agreement shall prohibit any Stockholder from taking any action that
the Company or its Representatives are permitted to take under Section 6.3 of
the Merger Agreement solely in such StockholderÂ’s capacity as a director or
other Representative of the Company.

 

(c) From the date of this Agreement and until the termination of this
Agreement, if any Stockholder transfers, sells, assigns, pledges or otherwise
disposes of any of such StockholderÂ’s Subject Shares (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any "Transfer" (as defined in the Company Certificate)) in
each case that would not cause or result in the conversion of such Subject
Shares into shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Company
Certificate, such Stockholder shall cause the transferee in any such transfer,
sale, assignment, pledge or other disposition to execute and deliver
a joinder to this Agreement in a form that is reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and Purchaser pursuant to which such transferee agrees to be bound as a
Stockholder hereunder.

 

(d) Each Stockholder shall not make any public announcement regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law; _provided_ , that
reasonable notice of any disclosure required by applicable Law shall be
provided to Parent, and such Stockholder will consider in good faith the
reasonable comments of Parent with respect to such disclosure and otherwise
cooperate with Parent in obtaining confidential treatment with respect to
such disclosure.

 



B-5

    

1.8. _Covenants of Parent and Purchaser_. Each of Parent and Purchaser
shall keep each Stockholder reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status of the Offer, including with respect to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that have been validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer, and material
developments with respect thereto and, upon each StockholderÂ’s request (no
more often than once per day during the Offer (other than on the date of the
expiration of the Offer)), provide such Stockholder as soon as practicable
with the most recent report then available from the Exchange Agent detailing
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that have been validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer;
_provided_ that delivery of such information or report to the Company or its
Representatives shall constitute delivery to the Stockholders for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 1.8_; provided, further, that a breach of this Section
1.8 shall not relieve or otherwise affect the obligations of the Stockholders
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

1.9. _Documentation and Information_. Each Stockholder hereby consents to
and hereby authorizes Parent and Purchaser to publish and disclose in all
documents and schedules filed with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity or
applicable securities exchange, and any press release or other disclosure
document that Parent or Purchaser reasonably determines to be necessary or
advisable in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement, such StockholderÂ’s
identity and ownership of such StockholderÂ’s Subject Shares, the existence of
this Agreement and the nature of such StockholderÂ’s commitments and
obligations under this Agreement, and such Stockholder acknowledges that
Parent and Purchaser may, in ParentÂ’s sole discretion, file this Agreement or
a form hereof with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity or securities
exchange.

1.10. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate automatically with
respect to each Stockholder, without any notice or other action by any Person,
upon the first to occur of (a) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement
in accordance with its terms, (b) the Effective Time, (c) the entry without
the prior written consent of such Stockholder into any amendment, waiver or
modification to the Merger Agreement, as in effect on the date hereof, that
results in a decrease in, or change in form of, the Offer Consideration or
the Merger Consideration or (d) the mutual written consent of Parent and such
Stockholder. Upon termination of this Agreement, no party shall have any
further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.10 _shall
relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement
prior to termination hereof and (ii) the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
1.10_ and _Sections 1.11_ through _1.25_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

 

1.11. _Notices_. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 1.3_, all notices and other communications hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given and received only if
delivered by electronic mail (notice deemed given upon confirmation
of receipt); _provided_ that the notice or other communication is sent to the
address or email address set forth (a) if to Parent or Purchaser, to the email
address set forth in Section 10.4 of the Merger Agreement and (b) if to
a Stockholder, to such StockholderÂ’s email address set forth on a signature
page hereto, or to such other email address as such party may hereafter
specify for the purpose by notice to each other party hereto.

 

1.12. _Amendments and Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in
the case of an

 



B-6

    

 amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by
each party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege.

 

1.13. _Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated.

 

1.14. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the other
documents and certificates delivered pursuant hereto, constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party (including by
operation of law, by merger or otherwise) without the prior written consent of
(a) Parent and Purchaser, in the case of an assignment by a Stockholder and
(b) each Stockholder, in the case of an assignment by Parent or Purchaser;
_provided_ , that Parent or Purchaser may assign any of their respective
rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no
such assignment shall relieve Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, of
its obligations hereunder.

1.15. _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the Parent and Purchaser would not
have any adequate remedy at law (even if available) in the event that any
Stockholder did not perform any of the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breached any such
provisions. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Purchaser shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without the posting of bond, to
prevent or remedy any breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon Parent and Purchaser will
be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by Law or equity upon Parent or Purchaser, and the exercise by
Parent or Purchaser of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

 

1.16. _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks
jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court
finds it lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court

 



B-7

    

 of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court
from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such courts and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such courts. Each
party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Each party
hereto irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section_ __ _
1.16(a)_ in the manner provided for notices in _Section_ __ _ 1.11_. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of Parent or Purchaser to serve
process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ _1.16(B)_.

 

1.17. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the
Law of any other state.

 

1.18. _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are inserted
for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

1.19. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 

1.20. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner.

 



B-8

    

1.21. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which, taken
together, shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement or any
counterpart may be executed and delivered by facsimile copies, electronic mail
in portable document format (.pdf), or any electronic signature complying
with the U.S. ESIGN Act of 2000 (including www.docusign.com), each of which
shall be deemed an original.

 

1.22. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
sections, such reference shall be to a section of this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The word
"extent" and the phrase "to the extent" when used in this Agreement shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other things extends, and such word or
phrase shall not merely mean "if." The term "or" is not exclusive, and shall
be interpreted as "and/or." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the
date hereof," "of even date herewith" and terms of similar import, shall be
deemed to refer to the date set forth in the preamble to this Agreement. This
Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to require any Person to take
any action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would violate any
applicable Law. A reference to any specific Law or to any provision of any
Law, whether or not followed by the phrase "as amended," includes any
amendment to, and any modification, re-enactment or successor thereof, any
legislative provision substituted therefor and all rules, regulations and
statutory instruments issued thereunder or pursuant thereto, except that, for
purposes of any representations and warranties in this Agreement that are made
as a specific date, references to any specific Law will be deemed to refer to
such legislation or provision (and all rules, regulations and statutory
instruments issued thereunder or pursuant thereto) as of such date. The
Parties agree that they have been represented by counsel during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive
the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

1.23. _Directors and Officers_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, but without limiting any provision of the Merger
Agreement in any respect, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict a
Stockholder, or any affiliate, employee or designee of a Stockholder, who is a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from acting in
such capacity or fulfilling the obligations of such office, including by
voting, in his capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its
SubsidiariesÂ’, in the StockholderÂ’s, or its affiliateÂ’s, employeeÂ’s or
designeeÂ’s, as applicable, sole discretion on any matter. In this regard, a
Stockholder shall not be deemed to make any agreement or understanding in this
Agreement in such StockholderÂ’s capacity as a director or officer of the
Company. Each Stockholder is executing this Agreement solely in such capacity
as a record or beneficial holder of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

1.24. _No Ownership Interest_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or
Purchaser any direct or indirect legal or beneficial ownership or incidence of
ownership of or with respect to the Subject Shares. All rights, ownership and
economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall remain vested
in and belong to each Stockholder (without limiting such StockholderÂ’s
obligations hereunder), and neither Parent nor Purchaser shall have any power
or authority to direct such Stockholder in the voting or Transfer (as defined
in the Company Certificate) of any of the Shares.

 



B-9

    

1.25. _Stockholder Obligation Several and Not Joint_. The obligations of
each Stockholder hereunder shall be several and not joint, and no Stockholder
shall be liable for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any other
Stockholder.

Re: Conversion of Tableau Software, Inc. Class B Common Stock to Class A
Common Stock

 

Dear Sir/Madam:

 

[ ] ("Entity Stockholder") currently holds shares of Class B
Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Class B Common Stock"), of Tableau
Software, Inc. (the "Company"). Each share of Class B Common Stock has ten
(10) votes per share, whereas each share of Class A Common Stock, par value
$0.0001 per share ("Class A Common Stock") of the Company has one (1) vote per
share. As of the date hereof, shares of Class B Common Stock cannot be traded
on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or transferred to a brokerage account
until such shares have been converted to shares of Class A Common Stock on a
1:1 basis by completing an irrevocable election to convert.
