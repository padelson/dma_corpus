State of Delaware.



(b) Prior to the Closing, Millennium shall prepare, and as soon as practicable
on the Closing Date shall cause a certificate of merger meeting the
requirements of Section 264 of the DGCL and Section 18-209 of the DLLCA (the
" _Delaware Certificate_ ") to be properly acknowledged, executed and filed in
accordance with such section and the other applicable provisions of the DGCL
and the DLLCA.



 

1 (c) The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Delaware Certificate

(b) In accordance with Section 202 of the DGCL, the Lyondell Initial Shares
shall be restricted and (i) shall not be owned by any Person other than
Millennium or Lyondell and (ii) shall not be transferred to any Person,
except that automatically at the Effective Time the Lyondell Initial Shares
shall be transferred to Lyondell. All certificates representing the Lyondell

Millennium Board. From and after the Effective Time, each such person shall
serve as a director of Lyondell until such persons successor is duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Lyondell.



ARTICLE 4



EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



Section 4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock of Millennium_. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger, and without any further action by
Millennium, Millennium Merger Sub or Lyondell or by the holders of any
securities of Millennium, Millennium Merger Sub or Lyondell:



(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each issued and outstanding share of Millennium
Common Stock (other than shares of Millennium Common Stock addressed in 
_Sections 4.1(c) or 4.1(d)_ ) shall automatically be converted into the right
to receive that number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Lyondell Common Stock as is equal to the Merger Consideration. As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Millennium Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such shares of Millennium Common Stock (the " _Millennium
Certificates_ "), shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration.



(b) _Effect on the Millennium Preferred Share_. The Millennium Preferred Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Entity as is equal to that number of shares of Millennium Common
Stock that are converted into the right to receive shares of Lyondell Common
Stock in the Merger.



(c) _Cancellation of Millennium Common Stock Owned by Lyondell_. Each share
of Millennium Common Stock that is owned directly by Lyondell or its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.



(d) _Effect on Millennium Treasury Stock_. Each share of Millenniums common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Millennium Common Stock_ "), that is
owned directly by Millennium immediately prior to the Effective Time and is
not held on behalf of any third party shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Each share of Millennium Common Stock that is owned directly by any
Subsidiary of Millennium immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not
held on behalf of any third party shall, at the written election of Lyondell
delivered to Millennium, (i)



 

4 automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, in which case no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, (ii) remain
outstanding as a share of common stock of the Surviving Entity, or (iii) be
converted into and exchanged for such other shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Entity as Lyondell may direct. Lyondell shall submit to Millennium,
for its consent, a proposal as to the election to be made by Lyondell and any
associated internal restructuring relating to the ownership by Subsidiaries of
Millennium of capital stock of Millennium (including distributions of
Millennium Common Stock by Subsidiaries of Millennium or conversions or
mergers of such Subsidiaries). The consent of Millennium to such proposal may
not be unreasonably withheld. Lyondell and Millennium shall consult and
cooperate with each other in good faith in developing and implementing such
proposal. If Lyondell fails to submit such a proposal to Millennium
sufficiently prior to the satisfaction of all conditions in _Article 8_ to
permit implementation prior to the Effective Time, then, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Millennium shall effect a series of mergers that merge
each Subsidiary that directly owns any Millennium Common Stock, and any
intermediate Subsidiary between such Subsidiary and Millennium, into
Millennium, so that immediately prior to the Effective Time the Millennium
Common Stock theretofore owned by any such Subsidiary is directly owned by
Millennium.



(e) _Conversion of Millennium Stock Options_.



(i) Millennium and Lyondell shall take all action reasonably necessary so that
each option to purchase shares of Millennium Common Stock (the " _Millennium
Stock Options_ ") outstanding under the Millennium 2001 Omnibus Incentive Plan
and the Millennium Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the " _Millennium Stock
Plans_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
automatically at the Effective Time into an option to purchase a number of
shares of Lyondell Common Stock (a " _Converted Option_ ") equal to the number
of shares of Millennium Common Stock subject to such Millennium Stock Option
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that any fractional
share resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole
share. Each Converted Option shall be fully vested as of the Effective Time
and the exercise price per share of each Converted Option shall equal the
exercise price per share of such Millennium Stock Option divided by the
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that such exercise price shall be
rounded to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Millennium Stock Option which is intended to be an "incentive stock option"
(as defined under Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance
with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. Millennium and Lyondell
shall not provide for the purchase of a Converted Option pursuant to Section
13.1 of the Millennium Long Term Stock Incentive Plan in connection with the
Merger.



(ii) As of the Effective Time, Lyondell shall assume the obligations of
Millennium under the Millennium Stock Plans, shall assume such plans for
purposes of employing such plans to make grants of stock options and other
awards based on Lyondell Common Stock following the Merger, and shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Lyondell Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Converted



 

5 Options. Lyondell shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
registration of the shares of Lyondell Common Stock subject to the Converted
Options, to become effective as part of a registration statement on Form S-8,
or any successor or other appropriate forms, with respect to the shares of
Lyondell Common Stock subject to the Converted Options, no later than the
Effective Time. Thereafter, to the extent required by law, Lyondell shall
deliver to holders of Converted Options any applicable prospectus and shall
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements, including the current status of any related prospectus, for so
long as the Converted Options remain outstanding. Millennium will make
available to Lyondell a true and complete list of all outstanding Millennium
Stock Options.



(iii) With respect to those individuals, if any, who subsequent to the
Effective Time will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Lyondell shall use all reasonable
efforts to administer or cause to be administered the Millennium Stock Plans
assumed pursuant to this _Section 4.1_ in a manner that complies with Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the Millennium Stock
Plans complied with such rule prior to the Merger.



(iv) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Lyondell shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to each holder of Converted Options an appropriate
notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant to any Millennium Stock
Plans, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby. 



(f) _Convertible Debentures_. Effective upon consummation of the Merger,
Lyondell shall execute and deliver a supplemental indenture whereby it shall
agree to be bound by the conversion provisions of Millenniums 4% Convertible
Senior Debentures due 2023 (the " _Convertible Debentures_ ") and take all
other action necessary, such that following the Effective Time, each
outstanding Convertible Debenture will be convertible into the Merger
Consideration which the holder thereof would have had the right to receive if
such Convertible Debenture had been converted into Millennium Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(g) _Effect on the Membership Interests of Millennium Merger Sub_. As of the
Effective Time, each membership interest of Millennium Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.



Section 4.2 _Merger Consideration_. The " _Merger Consideration_ " shall equal
the number of shares of Lyondell Common Stock determined as follows (the
resulting number of shares of Lyondell Common Stock so issuable in exchange
for one share of Millennium Common Stock, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "); if the
Daily Average Price of Lyondell Common Stock:



(a) is greater than or equal to $20.50, the Merger Consideration shall be
0.95 shares of Lyondell Common Stock.



 

6 (b) is less than $20.50 and greater than $16.50, the Merger Consideration
shall be the number of shares of Lyondell Common Stock determined by the
following formula:



1.4625 - (0.025 x Daily Average Price).



(c) is less than or equal to $16.50, the Merger Consideration shall be 1.05
shares of Lyondell Common Stock.



" _Daily Average Price_ " shall mean the average of the Daily Prices for the
20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date.



" _Daily Price_ " shall mean, on any Trading Day, the volume weighted average
price (calculated to the nearest thousandth) of Lyondell Common Stock on such
day for sales conducted regular way on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(the " _NYSE_ "), as such volume weighted average price is calculated on the
VAP screen on the Bloomberg Professional Service and shown as VWAP for such
period or, if not calculated thereby, another authoritative source.



" _Trading Day_ " shall mean any day on which the NYSE is open for trading.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time with the consent of the other party, the outstanding shares of
Lyondell Common Stock or Millennium Common Stock shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of
the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction (other than pursuant to a transaction expressly
contemplated by this Agreement), the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction.



Section 4.3 Exchange of Certificates.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Closing Date, Lyondell shall enter into an
agreement with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), which shall provide that Lyondell shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of Millennium Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article 4_ , through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing shares of Lyondell Common Stock (the " _Lyondell Certificates_ ")
representing the aggregate number of shares of Lyondell Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the issued and outstanding shares of Millennium Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 4.1_ (such shares of Lyondell Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto with a
record date after the Effective Time being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Millennium Certificate (each a " _Certificate_ ") whose shares have been
converted into the right to receive shares of Lyondell Common Stock pursuant
to _Section 4.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only



 

7 upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Millennium and Lyondell may reasonably
specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and for receipt of the Lyondell Certificates to which such holder
is entitled set forth in this _Article 4_. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive a Lyondell Certificate representing that number of
shares of Lyondell Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 4_ , and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Millennium Common Stock not registered in the transfer
records of Millennium, a Lyondell Certificate representing the proper number
of shares of Lyondell Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer
or other non-income taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of
Lyondell Common Stock to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Lyondell that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 4.3_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
Lyondell Certificates representing the number of shares of Lyondell Common
Stock which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article 4_.



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Lyondell Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Lyondell Common Stock issuable to
such holder hereunder and no cash payment for fractional shares shall be paid
to any such holder pursuant to _Section 4.3(d)_ , in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Article 4_. All such
dividends and other distributions shall be paid by Lyondell to the Exchange
Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund. Subject to the effect of
applicable escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of a Lyondell Certificate
representing shares of Lyondell Common Stock issued in the Merger (i) at the
time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable for a fractional share
of Lyondell Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
4.3(d)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Lyondell Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Lyondell Common Stock.
Lyondell shall make available to the Exchange Agent for these purposes, as
necessary, cash and other property, if any, to which the holder may be
entitled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 4_.



(d) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates representing fractional shares of
Lyondell Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates pursuant to this _Article 4_ , and, except as provided in this
_Section 4.3(d)_ , no dividend or other distribution shall relate to any such
fractional security. In lieu of any fractional security, each



 

8 holder of shares of Millennium Common Stock who would otherwise have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of Lyondell Common Stock pursuant to this
_Article 4_ will be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such
holders proportionate interest in the sum of (i) the net proceeds from the
sale or sales by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 4.3(d)_ , on behalf of all such holders, of the Excess Securities and
(ii) the aggregate dividends or other distributions that are payable with
respect to such Excess Securities pursuant to _Section 4.3(c)_  (such
dividends and distributions being herein called the " _Fractional Dividends_
"). As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall determine the excess of (x) the number of whole shares of
Lyondell Common Stock into which the Millennium Common Stock was converted
pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ over (y) the aggregate number of whole shares of
Lyondell Common Stock to which the former holders of Millennium Common Stock
are entitled pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ (such excess being herein called
the " _Excess Securities_ ") and the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former
holders of Millennium Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Securities at the
prevailing prices on the NYSE. The sale of the Excess Securities by the
Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms
of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The
Exchange Agent shall deduct from the proceeds of sale of the Excess
Securities all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction
costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred
in connection with such sale of Excess Securities. Until the net proceeds of
such sale of Excess Securities and the Fractional Dividends have been
distributed to the former stockholders of Millennium, the Exchange Agent will
hold such proceeds and dividends in trust for such former stockholders. As
soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid
to former stockholders of Millennium for any fractional interests, the
Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance with this Agreement such
amounts to such former stockholders.



(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Millennium Common Stock_. All shares of
Lyondell Common Stock represented by the Lyondell Certificates delivered upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article 4_
(including any cash or other property delivered pursuant to this _Article 4_
) shall be deemed to have been issued (and delivered) in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Millennium Common Stock previously
owned by the holders of such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving
Entitys obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with
a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized or
made by Millennium on such shares of Millennium Common Stock which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time.



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund and any
cash for fractional shares of Lyondell Common Stock made available to the
Exchange Agent which remain undistributed to the holders of the Certificates
for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Lyondell, and
any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article 4_ shall thereafter look only to Lyondell for payment of their claim
for Merger Consideration, cash for fractional shares, and any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of Lyondell Common Stock.



(g) _No Liability_. None of Lyondell, Millennium, Millennium Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of
Lyondell Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash or other property from the



 

9 Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any Merger Consideration, any cash or other property delivered to the
holder of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article 4_ or any dividends or
distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any governmental body or authority, any
Merger Consideration, cash and dividends or distributions in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of Lyondell, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.



(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Lyondell, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Lyondell; _provided, however,_ that no such investment or loss shall affect
the amounts payable to any holder of a Certificate. 



(i) _Exchanges by Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Lyondell Common Stock and Lyondell Certificates
therefor issued to affiliates of Millennium as a result of the Merger shall be
subject to the restrictions on transfer described in _Section 7.13_  and
_Exhibit 7.13_ , and such shares shall bear restrictive legends as described
in _Exhibit 7.13_.



(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Lyondell, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Lyondell may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver
upon receipt of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate Lyondell
Certificates representing the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any
unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Lyondell Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.



(k) _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of
Millennium Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or under any provision of state or foreign tax law. To the extent amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the former holder of the shares of Millennium Common Stock. If
withholding is required from shares of Lyondell Common Stock, the Exchange
Agent shall sell in the open market such shares of Lyondell Common Stock as is
necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation and shall pay such cash
proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority. 



Section 4.4 _Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Millennium Common Stock
in connection with the Merger.



 

10 ARTICLE 5



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MILLENNIUM



Except as set forth in (i) the Millennium Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2003 (excluding the documents filed as
exhibits thereto to the extent that the information is only set forth in such
exhibit) (the " _Millennium 2003 10-K_ ") or (ii) the disclosure letter
delivered to Lyondell by Millennium at or prior to the execution hereof
(the " _Millennium Disclosure Letter_ ") and which either makes reference to
the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken
or for which the disclosure in the Millennium Disclosure Letter is
sufficiently obvious on its face to give Lyondell reasonable notice that it
applies as an exception to another representation and warranty in this Article
5, Millennium represents and warrants to Lyondell the following:



Section 5.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. Millennium is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Millennium is duly qualified to do business
and, to the extent such concept or similar concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which
the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified does not and is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.
Millennium has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and
lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The
copies of Millenniums restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws
previously made available to Lyondell are true and correct and contain all
amendments as of the date hereof.



Section 5.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of
Agreements; Recommendation_. Millennium has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and
documents contemplated hereby to which it is or will become a party and to
consummate the transactions this Agreement and those other agreements and
documents contemplate. The consummation by Millennium of the transactions
contemplated hereby has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action
on behalf of Millennium, other than the approvals referred to in _Section
5.20_. Millennium has duly executed and delivered this Agreement. This
Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of Millennium,
enforceable against Millennium in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity.



Section 5.3 _Exemption from Section 203; Charter and Bylaws_. The Board of
Directors of each of Millennium and Millennium Merger Sub has taken
all appropriate and necessary actions exempting this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby from (i) the restrictions on "business
combinations" set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and (ii) any other
applicable takeover law restricting or purporting to restrict business
combinations. No anti-takeover provision contained in the charter or bylaws of
Millennium or Millennium Merger Sub is, or at the Effective Time will be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.



 

11 Section 5.4 _Capitalization_. As of the date hereof, the authorized Millennium
Common Stock consists of 225,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share. As of March 17, 2004, 77,896,586 shares of Millennium Common Stock were
issued and outstanding, of which 12,861,460 were held by Millennium US Op.
Co., LLC and treated as treasury shares in the consolidated financial
statements of Millennium, and no shares of preferred stock were issued and
outstanding. Between March 17, 2004 and the date of this Agreement, no more
than 10,000 shares of Millennium Common Stock have been issued and, except as
provided in _Section 1.2_ , no shares of preferred stock have been issued. All
of the outstanding shares of Millennium Common Stock have been
duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. Other than shares of Millennium capital stock reserved for
issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Debentures, pursuant to
Millenniums Long Term Stock Incentive Plan, Millenniums Long Term Incentive
Plan, Millenniums Executive Long Term Incentive Plan and Millenniums Omnibus
Plan (collectively, the " _Millennium Plans_ "), Millennium has no shares of
Millennium Common Stock or preferred stock or other shares of capital stock
reserved for or otherwise subject to issuance, except as provided in _Section
1.2_. As of March 17, 2004, there were not more than 2,645,345 shares of
Millennium Common Stock that Millennium was obligated to issue pursuant to
Millennium Plans. Except pursuant to the Millennium Plans or the Convertible
Debentures or as set forth above, there are no preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries,
and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued
or outstanding. Other than the Convertible Debentures, Millennium has no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other debt obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable
for securities the holders of which have the right to vote) with the
stockholders of Millennium on any matter. Other than as set forth above, no
shares of Millennium Common Stock are held by a Subsidiary of Millennium.
Section 5.4 of the Millennium Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of (i) all
outstanding options and warrants of Millennium as of the date hereof together
with all applicable exercise or strike prices, vesting and termination dates
of such options and warrants and (ii) all shares of restricted stock
outstanding and the vesting dates of such restricted stock. __



Section 5.5 _Subsidiaries_. Each of Millenniums Subsidiaries is a corporation
or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the
corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing (where applicable) in each jurisdiction in
which the ownership, operation or lease of its property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such
failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing does not and is not
reasonably likely to have a Millennium Material Adverse Effect. As of the date
of this Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other ownership interests in, each of Millenniums Subsidiaries are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned,
directly or indirectly, by Millennium free and clear of all mortgages, deeds
of trust, liens, security interests, pledges, leases, conditional sale
contracts, charges, privileges, easements, rights of way, reservations,
options, rights of first refusal and other encumbrances (" _Liens_ ").



 

12 Section 5.6 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except for such matters as,
individually or in the aggregate, do not or are not reasonably likely to have
a Millennium Material Adverse Effect:



(a) Neither Millennium nor any Subsidiary of Millennium is in violation of any
applicable law, rule, regulation, code, governmental determination, order,
treaty, convention or governmental certification requirement, U.S. or
non-U.S. (collectively, " _Applicable Laws_ "), and no claim is pending or, to
the knowledge of Millennium, threatened with respect to any such matters.



(b) No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of
Millennium, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention
to conduct the same.



(c) To the knowledge of Millennium, no material change is required in its or
any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties or procedures in connection
with any such Applicable Laws, and it has not received any notice or
communication of any material noncompliance with any such Applicable Laws that
has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement.



(d) Millennium and each Subsidiary of Millennium hold all material
permits, licenses, certifications, variations, exemptions, orders, franchises
and approvals of all governmental or regulatory authorities necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the " _Millennium Permits_ ").
All Millennium Permits are in full force and effect and there exists no
default thereunder or breach thereof, and Millennium has no notice or
knowledge that such Millennium Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary
course after the Effective Time. No Governmental Entity has given notice of,
or to the knowledge of Millennium threatened to give notice of or to take, any
action to terminate, cancel or reform any Millennium Permit.



(e) Millennium and each Subsidiary of Millennium possess all material permits,
licenses, operating authorities, orders, exemptions, franchises, variances,
consents, approvals or other authorizations required for the present ownership
and operation of all its real property or leaseholds (" _Millennium Real
Property_ "). There exists no material default or breach with respect to, and
no party or Governmental Entity has taken or, to the knowledge of Millennium,
threatened to take, any action to terminate, cancel or reform any such permit,
license, operating authority, order, exemption, franchise, variance, consent,
approval or other authorization pertaining to Millennium Real Property.



Section 5.7 _No Conflict_. Neither the execution and delivery by Millennium of
this Agreement nor the consummation by Millennium of the Merger in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement will:



(a) (i) subject to the approvals referred to in _Section 5.20_ , conflict
with or result in a breach or violation of, or default under any provisions of
its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (ii) conflict with or result in a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws or comparable governing instruments of any of its



 

13 Subsidiaries, (iii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any
provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the
termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a
right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result
in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties of Millennium or its
Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void, voidable, or without
further binding effect, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit,
lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to
which Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Millennium
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties is bound or
affected or (iv) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in

Millennium and its Subsidiaries have filed with the SEC all documents
required to be so filed by them in the preceding three fiscal years and during
2004 pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act without regard to Rule
12b-25. Millennium has made available to Lyondell each
registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement
(other than preliminary materials) it or its Subsidiaries have so filed in the
preceding three fiscal years and during 2004, each in the form (including
exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the "
_Millennium Reports_ "). As of its respective date, each Millennium Report (i)
complied in all material respects in accordance with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the 



 

14 rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading except for such
statements, if any, as have been modified by subsequent filings with the SEC
prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in
or incorporated by reference into Millennium Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Millennium and its Subsidiaries as of
its date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows
and changes in stockholders equity included in or incorporated by reference
into Millennium Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents in all material respects the results of operations, cash flows or
changes in stockholders equity, as the case may be, of Millennium and its
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q
and Regulation S-X of the SEC and (y) normal year-end audit adjustments), in
each case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein, except for such consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity, if
any, as have been modified or restated and have been included in subsequent
filings with the SEC prior to the date hereof.



(b) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of
Millennium and its Subsidiaries included in the Millennium 2003
10-K, including all notes thereto, as of the date of such balance sheet,
neither Millennium nor any of its Subsidiaries had any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, the
balance sheet of Millennium or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, other
than liabilities or obligations which do not and are not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.

rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC; such certifications are complete
and correct, contain no qualifications or exceptions to the matters
certified therein and have not been modified or withdrawn; and Millennium is
otherwise in compliance with all applicable effective provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable effective listing and corporate
governance rules of the NYSE. Neither Millennium nor any of its officers has
received notice from any Governmental Entity challenging or questioning the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of the
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and made by its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.



(d) Millennium has in place the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) required in
order for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
Millennium to engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by the
Exchange Act. Millenniums disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Millennium in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified



 

15 in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Millenniums management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
Millennium referenced in _Section 5.8(c)_.



(e) Millennium and its Subsidiaries maintain accurate books and
records reflecting in all material respects its assets and liabilities and
maintain proper and adequate internal accounting controls.



(f) Neither Millennium nor its Subsidiaries has, since July 30, 2002, extended
or maintained credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed
an extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any director

extension of credit is maintained by Millennium or its Subsidiaries to which
the second sentence of Section 13(k)(1) of the Exchange Act applies.



Section 5.9  _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits, investigations,
inquiries or other proceedings pending against Millennium or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to Millenniums knowledge, threatened against Millennium or

resolution body, or any new development in any such existing actions, suits,
investigations, inquiries or other proceedings, that are reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth in the footnotes to the balance sheet of Millennium and
its subsidiaries included in the Millennium 2003 10-K, the liabilities that
are reasonably likely to be incurred by Millennium in such actions,
suits, investigations, inquiries or other proceedings do not exceed the

likely to have a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.

aggregate, a Millennium Material Adverse Effect, and there are no
assertions or claims challenging the validity of any of the foregoing that
are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Millennium
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Millennium, the conduct of
Millenniums and its Subsidiaries respective businesses as currently
conducted does not conflict with any patents, patent rights, licenses,
trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights or copyrights of
others that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Millennium Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Millennium, there is
no material infringement of any proprietary right owned by or licensed by or
to Millennium or any of its Subsidiaries that is reasonably likely to have
individually or in the aggregate, a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.



Section 5.16 _Decrees, Etc._ Except for such matters as do not and are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Millennium
Material Adverse Effect, (i) no order, writ, fine, injunction, decree,
judgment, award or determination of any court or Governmental Entity has been
issued or entered against Millennium or any Subsidiary of Millennium that
continues to be in effect that affects the ownership or operation of any of
their respective assets, and (ii) no criminal order, writ, fine, injunction,
decree, judgment or determination of any court or Governmental Entity has been
issued against Millennium or any Subsidiary of Millennium.



Section 5.17 _Insurance_.



(a) Section 5.17 of the Millennium Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete list of all material insurance policies maintained by Millennium and
its Subsidiaries, including the name of the issuer, the amount and nature of
the coverage, the amount of the premium and terms of the coverage. All such
policies are in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement



 

24 and the premiums therefore are currently paid. Millennium and its Subsidiaries
maintain insurance in such amounts and against such losses as are customary
in the businesses conducted by Millennium prior to and as of the date hereof.



(b) To the knowledge of Millennium, no event relating specifically to
Millennium or its Subsidiaries (as opposed to events generally affecting the
segment or segments of the chemicals industry in which Millennium or any of
its Subsidiaries operates or the insurance markets generally) has occurred
that is reasonably likely, after the date of this Agreement, to result in a
10% increase in premiums under any material insurance policies they maintain.
Excluding insurance policies that have expired and been replaced in the
ordinary course of business, no excess liability or protection and indemnity
insurance policy has been canceled by the insurer within one year prior to
the date hereof, and to Millenniums knowledge, no threat in writing has been
made to cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew)
any such insurance policy of Millennium or any Subsidiary of Millennium
during the period of one year prior to the date hereof. Prior to the date
hereof, no event has occurred, including the failure by Millennium or any
Subsidiary of Millennium to give any notice or information or by giving any
inaccurate or erroneous notice or information, which materially limits or
impairs the rights of Millennium or any Subsidiary of Millennium under any
such excess liability or protection and indemnity insurance policies.



Section 5.18 _No Brokers_. Millennium has not entered into any
contract, arrangement or understanding with any person or firm which may
result in the obligation of Millennium or Lyondell to pay any finders fees,
brokerage or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading
to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that Millennium has retained J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and
UBS Securities LLC as its financial advisors, the arrangements with each of
which have been disclosed in writing to Lyondell prior to the date hereof.



Section 5.19 _Opinions of Financial Advisors_. The Millennium Board has
received the opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and the opinion of UBS
Securities LLC, each to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the
Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of
Millennium Common Stock. A copy of each of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. and the written opinion of UBS Securities LLC will be
delivered to Lyondell as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement.



Section 5.20 _Vote Required_. The only votes of the holders of any class or
series of Millennium capital stock necessary to approve any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement are the affirmative vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement (the " _Millennium Stockholder Approval Item_ "),
of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Millennium
Common Stock.



Section 5.21 _Title to Properties; Liens and Encumbrances_. Except as is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Millennium
Material Adverse Effect, Millennium and its Subsidiaries have defensible title
to all of the properties and assets, both real and personal, tangible and
intangible, that they purport to own, including the properties and assets
reflected in the Millennium 2003 10-K, and they are not subject to any Lien,
except routine statutory liens securing liabilities not yet due and payable
and minor liens,



 

25 encumbrances, restrictions, exceptions, reservations, limitations and other
imperfections (but in no event liens securing indebtedness for borrowed
money) that do not materially detract from the value of the specific asset
affected or the present use of such asset and except Liens permitted pursuant
to Section 6.01 of the Credit Agreement (the " _Millennium Credit Agreement_
"), dated as of June 18, 2001, by and among Millennium America Inc.,
Millennium Inorganic Chemicals Limited, Millennium Chemicals Inc., Bank of
America, N.A., The Chase Manhattan Bank and the other parties thereto,
as amended (the " _Millennium Permitted Liens_ ").



Section 5.22 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Millennium nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
fixed, accrued, contingent or otherwise, except liabilities and obligations
that (i) are disclosed in the Millennium 2003 10-K (including the financial
statements and all notes contained therein), (ii) are referred to in the
Millennium Disclosure Letter or (iii) do not and are not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.



Section 5.23 _Certain Contracts_.



(a) Section 5.23 of Millennium Disclosure Letter contains a list of all of
the following contracts or agreements (other than those listed as an exhibit
to the Millennium 2003 10-K) to which Millennium or any Subsidiary of
Millennium is a party or by which any of them is bound as of the date of this
Agreement: (i) any non-competition agreement that purports to limit the manner
in which, or the localities in which, all or any material portion of their
respective businesses is conducted; (ii) any supply or sales contracts of one

disposition had not been completed as of January 1, 2003; or (v) any
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC) (all contracts or agreements of the types described in
_clauses (i) through (v)_ being referred to herein as " _Millennium Material
Contracts_ ").



(b) Each Millennium Material Contract is in full force and effect (except, as
of the Closing Date, those that expired by their terms between the date hereof
and the Closing Date), and Millennium and each of its Subsidiaries have in
all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by
them to date under each Millennium Material Contract, except where such
failure to be binding or in full force and effect or such failure to perform
does not and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Millennium Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as do
not and are not reasonably likely to have a Millennium Material Adverse
Effect, neither Millennium nor any of its Subsidiaries (x) knows of, or has
received written notice of, any breach of or violation or default under (nor,
to the knowledge of Millennium, does there exist any condition which with the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a
violation or default under) any Millennium Material Contract or (y) has
received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to any
such Millennium Material Contract to exercise any rights such party has to
cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or exercise remedies thereunder.
Each Millennium Material Contract is enforceable by Millennium or a Subsidiary
of Millennium in accordance with its terms, subject



 

26 to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity,
except where such unenforceability is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.

respects for each of Millenniums capital expenditure programs, the capital

improper payments have been made by Millennium or any Subsidiary of
Millennium or, to the knowledge of Millennium, any agent of any of them in
connection with the conduct of their respective businesses or the operation of
their respective assets, and neither Millennium, nor any Subsidiary of
Millennium nor, to the knowledge of Millennium, any agent of any of them has
received any such payments from vendors, suppliers or other persons, where any
such payment made or received is reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Millennium Material Adverse Effect.



Section 5.26 _Stock Ownership of Lyondell_. Neither Millennium nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns any shares of capital stock of Lyondell or any other
securities convertible into or otherwise exercisable to acquire shares of
capital stock of Lyondell, other than as provided in this Agreement.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF LYONDELL



Except as set forth in (i) the Lyondell Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2003 (excluding the documents filed as exhibits
thereto to the extent that the information is only set forth in such exhibit)
(the " _Lyondell 2003 10-K_ ") or (ii) the disclosure letter delivered to
Millennium by Lyondell at or prior to the execution hereof (the " _Lyondell
Disclosure Letter_ ") and which either makes reference to the particular
subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken or for which
the disclosure in the Lyondell Disclosure Letter is sufficiently obvious on
its face to give Millennium reasonable notice that it applies as an exception
to another representation and warranty in this _Article 6_ , Lyondell
represents and warrants to Millennium the following:



Section 6.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. Lyondell is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. Lyondell is duly qualified to do business and,
to the extent such concept or similar concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which
the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified does not and is not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Lyondell Material Adverse Effect.
Lyondell has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and
lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The
copies of Lyondells restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws
previously made available to Millennium are true and correct and contain all
amendments as of the date hereof.



Section 6.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of
Agreements; Recommendation_. Lyondell has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and
documents contemplated hereby to which it is or will become a party and to
consummate the transactions this Agreement and those other agreements and
documents contemplate. The consummation by Lyondell of the transactions
contemplated hereby has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action
on behalf of Lyondell, other than the approvals referred to in _Section
6.20_. Lyondell has duly executed and delivered this Agreement. This Agreement
constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of Lyondell, enforceable
against Lyondell in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity.



 

28 Section 6.3 _Exemption from Section 203; Charter and Bylaws_. The Board of
Directors of Lyondell has taken all appropriate and necessary actions
exempting this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from (i) the
restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL
and (ii) any other applicable takeover law restricting or purporting to
restrict business combinations. No anti-takeover provision contained in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Lyondell is, or at the Effective
Time will be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby. 



Section 6.4 _Capitalization_. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital
stock of Lyondell consists of 340,000,000 shares of Lyondell Common Stock,
80,000,000 shares of Series B common stock, par value $1.00 per share, and
80,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of March

Series B common stock, and no shares of preferred stock were issued and
outstanding, and 1,786,440 shares of Lyondell Common Stock were held in
Treasury. All of the outstanding shares of Lyondell Common Stock and Series B
common stock have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Other than shares of Lyondell
Common Stock reserved for issuance (i) pursuant to the Lyondell Rights
Agreement, dated December 8, 1995, as amended, (ii) the Stockholders Agreement
dated August 22, 2002 between Lyondell and Occidental Chemical Holding
Corporation and Occidental Petroleum Corporation, as amended, with respect to
the Series B common stock, and (iii) upon exercise of the Warrant to purchase
5,000,000 shares of Lyondell Common Stock issued August 22, 2002 to Occidental
Chemical Holding Corporation, Lyondell has no shares of Lyondell Common Stock,
Series B common stock or preferred stock or other shares of capital stock
reserved for or otherwise subject to issuance. As of March 10, 2004, there
were not more than 1,288,576 shares of Lyondell Common Stock that Lyondell was
obligated to issue to employees or directors pursuant to Lyondells stock
incentive plans, each of which are listed in Section 6.12(a) of the Lyondell
Disclosure Letter. Except pursuant to the plans listed in Section 6.12(a) of
the Lyondell Disclosure Letter (the " _Lyondell Stock Plans_ "), or as set
forth above, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options,
warrants, calls, subscriptions, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights,
redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments
to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of Lyondell or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.
Lyondell has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other debt obligations
the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of
Lyondell on any matter. No shares of Lyondell Common Stock are held by a
Subsidiary of Lyondell. __



Section 6.5 _Subsidiaries_. Each of Lyondells Subsidiaries is a corporation
or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the
corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing (where applicable) in each jurisdiction
in which the ownership, operation or lease of its property or the conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which
such failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing does not and is not
reasonably likely to have a Lyondell Material Adverse Effect. As of the date
of this Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
ownership interests in, each of Lyondells Subsidiaries and joint ventures
are duly authorized,



 

29 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly or
indirectly, by Lyondell free and clear of all Liens, except as pledged to
secure Lyondells obligations under the Amended and Revised Credit Agreement
dated as of June 27, 2002 by and among Lyondell, JPMorgan Chase Bank and the
other parties thereto (the " _Lyondell Credit Agreement_ ").



Section 6.6 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except for such matters as,
individually or in the aggregate, do not or are not reasonably likely to have
a Lyondell Material Adverse Effect:



(a) Neither Lyondell nor any Subsidiary of Lyondell is in violation of any
Applicable Law, and no claim is pending or, to the knowledge of
Lyondell, threatened with respect to such matters.



(b) No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
Lyondell or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of
Lyondell, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention
to conduct the same.



(c) To the knowledge of Lyondell, no material change is required in its
or any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties or procedures in connection
with any such Applicable Laws, and it has not received any notice or
communication of any material noncompliance with any such Applicable Laws that
has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement.



(d) Lyondell and each Subsidiary of Lyondell hold all material permits,
licenses, certifications, variations, exemptions, orders, franchises and
approvals of all governmental or regulatory authorities necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the " _Lyondell Permits_ ").
All Lyondell Permits are in full force and effect and there exists no default
thereunder or breach thereof, and Lyondell has no notice or knowledge that
such Lyondell Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary course after the
Effective Time. No Governmental Entity has given, or to the knowledge of
Lyondell threatened to give, any action to terminate, cancel or reform any
Lyondell Permit.



(e) Lyondell and each Subsidiary of Lyondell possess all material permits,
licenses, operating authorities, orders, exemptions, franchises, variances,
consents, approvals or other authorizations required for the present ownership
and operation of all its real property or leaseholds (" _Lyondell Real
Property_ "). There exists no material default or breach with respect to, and
no party or Governmental Entity has taken or, to the knowledge of Lyondell,
threatened to take, any action to terminate, cancel or reform any such permit,
license, operating authority, order, exemption, franchise, variance, consent,
approval or other authorization pertaining to Lyondell Real Property.



Section 6.7 _No Conflict_. Neither the execution and delivery by Lyondell of
this Agreement nor the consummation by Lyondell of the Merger will:



(a) (i) subject to the approvals referred to in _Section 6.20_ , conflict with
or result in a breach or violation of, or default under any provisions of its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (ii) conflict or result in a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
or comparable governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)
violate, or conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a



 

30 default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of
termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties of Lyondell or its Subsidiaries under, or result
in being declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
deed of trust, license, franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement,
joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which Lyondell or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Lyondell or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their properties is bound or affected or (iv) subject to the filings
and other matters referred to in _Section 6.7(c)_ , contravene or conflict
with or constitute a violation of any provision of any Applicable Law binding
upon or applicable to Lyondell or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such
matters described in clause (ii) or (iii) as do not and are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Lyondell Material Adverse
Effect;



(b) result in any "change of control" or similar event or circumstance under
(i) the terms of any Lyondell Material Contract or (ii) any contract or plan
under which any employees, officers or directors of Lyondell or any of its
Subsidiaries are entitled to payments or benefits, which, in the case of
either _clause (i) or (ii)_ , gives rise to rights or benefits not
otherwise available absent such change of control or similar event and
requires either a cash payment or an accounting charge in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, or (iii) any Lyondell Permit; or



(c) require any consent, approval or authorization of, or filing
or registration with, any Governmental Entity, other than the filings or
notices (i) specifically referenced in _Section 1.1_ , (ii) under the HSR Act,
the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, or (iii) under applicable state
securities and "Blue Sky" laws or applicable non-U.S. competition, antitrust
or premerger notification laws ((i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the "
_Lyondell Regulatory Filings_ "), except for any consent, approval or
authorization the failure of which to obtain and for any filing or
registration the failure of which to make does not and is not reasonably
likely to have a Lyondell Material Adverse Effect or substantially impair or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 6.8 _SEC Documents_.



(a) Lyondell has timely filed with the SEC all documents required to be
so filed by it in the preceding twelve months pursuant to Sections 13(a),
14(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Lyondell and its Subsidiaries have filed
with the SEC all documents required to be so filed by them in the preceding
three fiscal years and during 2004 pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange
Act without regard to Rule 12b-25. Lyondell has made available to Millennium
each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement
(other than preliminary materials) it or its Subsidiaries have so filed in
the preceding three fiscal years and during 2004 each in the form (including
exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the "
_Lyondell Reports_ "). As of its respective date, each Lyondell Report (i)
complied in all material respects in accordance with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
(ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not



 

31 misleading except for such statements, if any, as have been modified by
subsequent filings with the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
Lyondell Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Lyondell
and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements
of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity included in or
incorporated by reference into Lyondell Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders equity, as the case may be,
of Lyondell and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may be
permitted by Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X of the SEC and (y) normal year-end
audit adjustments), in each case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied during the periods involved,
except as may be noted therein, except for such consolidated balance sheets
and consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in
stockholders equity, if any, as have been modified or restated and have
been included in subsequent filings with the SEC prior to the date hereof.



(b) Except as and to the extent set forth on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet of Lyondell and its Subsidiaries included in the Lyondell 2003
10-K, including all notes thereto, as of the date of such balance sheet,
neither Lyondell nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, a balance
sheet of Lyondell or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, other than
liabilities or obligations which do not and are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Lyondell Material Adverse Effect.



(c) The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Lyondell have
made all certifications required by Section 302 and Section 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC; such certifications are complete and correct, contain no
qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein and have not
been modified or withdrawn; and Lyondell is otherwise in compliance with all
applicable effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable
effective listing and corporate governance rules of the NYSE. Neither
Lyondell nor any of its officers has received notice from any Governmental
Entity challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner
of filing or submission of the certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and made by its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.



(d) Lyondell has in place the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined
in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) required in order for
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Lyondell to engage
in the review and evaluation process mandated by the Exchange Act. Lyondells
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Lyondell in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Lyondells management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Lyondell
referenced in _Section 6.8(c)_.



 

32 (e) Lyondell and its Subsidiaries maintain accurate books and records
reflecting in all material respects its assets and liabilities and maintain
proper and adequate internal accounting controls.



(f) Neither Lyondell nor its Subsidiaries has, since July 30, 2002, extended
or maintained credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an
extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or
executive officer (or equivalent thereof) of Lyondell. No loan or extension of
credit is maintained by Lyondell or its Subsidiaries to which the second
sentence of Section 13(k)(1) of the Exchange Act applies.



Section 6.9 _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits,
investigations, inquiries or other or proceedings pending against Lyondell or
any of its Subsidiaries or, to Lyondells knowledge, threatened against
Lyondell or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity or in any arbitration
or similar actions, suits, investigations, inquiries or other or proceedings,
before or by any U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. court, commission, board,
bureau, agency or instrumentality or any U.S. or non-U.S. arbitral or other
dispute resolution body, or any new development in any such existing actions,
suits, investigations, inquiries or other or proceedings, that are reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Lyondell Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in the footnotes to the balance sheet of Lyondell
and its subsidiaries included in the Lyondell 2003 10-K, the liabilities that
are reasonably likely to be incurred by Lyondell in such actions, suits,
investigations, inquiries or other or proceedings do not exceed the
reserves included in such balance sheets by an amount which is reasonably
likely to have a Lyondell Material Adverse Effect.



Section 6.10 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2003, there has
not been: (i) any event or occurrence that has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Lyondell Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any change by Lyondell or any of
its Subsidiaries in any of its accounting methods, principles or practices or
any of its tax methods, practices or elections, except as required by
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; (iii) any damage to or any
destruction or loss of physical properties Lyondell or any of its Subsidiaries
owns or uses, whether or not covered by insurance, that in the aggregate have
had or are reasonably likely to have a Lyondell Material Adverse Effect; or
(iv) any reevaluations by Lyondell or any of its Subsidiaries of any of their
assets which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
Lyondell will reflect in its consolidated financial statements, including any
impairment of assets, and which in the aggregate are material to them.



Section 6.11 _Taxes_. Except for such matters as relate to items as,
individually or in the aggregate, do not or are not reasonably likely to have
an Lyondell Material Adverse Effect:



(a) Each of Lyondell and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed all Tax
Returns that it was required to file. All such Tax Returns were correct and

date of the most recent balance sheet included in the Lyondell 2003 10-K

most recent balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto), and (ii) do not
exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing
Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of Lyondell and its

possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all patents, patent

and against such losses as are customary in the businesses as conducted by
Lyondell prior to and as of the date hereof. All material insurance policies
maintained by Lyondell and its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect as of
the date hereof and the premiums therefore are currently paid. 



(b) To the knowledge of Lyondell, no event relating specifically to Lyondell
or its Subsidiaries (as opposed to events generally affecting the segment or
segments of the chemicals industry in which Lyondell or any of its

increase in premiums under any material insurance policies they maintain.

insurance policy has been canceled by the insurer within one year prior to the

to cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew) any
such insurance policy of Lyondell or any Subsidiary of Lyondell during the
period of one year prior to the date hereof. Prior to the date hereof, no
event has occurred, including the failure by Lyondell or any Subsidiary of

erroneous notice or information, which materially limits or impairs the rights
of Lyondell or any Subsidiary of Lyondell under any such excess liability
and indemnity insurance policies.



Section 6.18 _No Brokers_. Lyondell has not entered into any contract,
arrangement or understanding with any person or firm which may result in the

except routine statutory liens securing liabilities not yet due and payable

securing indebtedness for borrowed money) that do not materially detract from
the value of the specific asset affected or the present use of such asset and
except Liens permitted pursuant to Section 5.9 of the Lyondell Credit
Agreement (the " _Lyondell Permitted Liens_ ").



Section 6.22 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Lyondell nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or
not fixed, accrued, contingent or otherwise, except liabilities and
obligations that (i) are disclosed in the Lyondell 2003 10-K (including the

to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Lyondell Material Adverse Effect.



Section 6.23 _Certain Contracts_. Each contract or agreement to which Lyondell
or any Subsidiary of Lyondell is a party or by which any of them is bound as
of the date of this Agreement and that is material to Lyondell and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (" _Lyondell Material Contracts_ ") is in full
force and effect (except, as of the Closing Date, those that expired by
their terms between the date hereof and the Closing Date), and Lyondell and
each of its Subsidiaries have in all material respects performed all
obligations required to be performed by them to date under each Lyondell
Material Contract, except where such failure to be binding or in full force
and effect or such failure to perform does not and is not reasonably likely to

Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have a
Lyondell Material Adverse Effect, neither Lyondell nor any of its Subsidiaries
(i) has received written notice of any breach of or violation or default under
(nor, to the knowledge of Lyondell, does there exist any condition which with
the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a
violation or default under) any Lyondell Material Contract or (ii) has
received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to any
such Lyondell Material Contract to exercise any rights such party has to
cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or exercise remedies thereunder.
Each Lyondell Material Contract is enforceable by Lyondell or a Subsidiary of
Lyondell in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors rights and general principles of equity, except where such
unenforceability is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Lyondell Material Adverse Effect.



Section 6.24 _Improper Payments_. No bribes, kickbacks or other improper
payments have been made by Lyondell or any Subsidiary of Lyondell or, to the
knowledge of Lyondell, any agent of any of them in connection with the conduct
of their respective businesses or the operation of their respective assets,
and neither Lyondell nor any Subsidiary of Lyondell nor, to the knowledge of
Lyondell, any agent of any of them has received any such payments from
vendors, suppliers or other persons, where any such payment made or received
is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Lyondell
Material Adverse Effect.



 

39 Section 6.25 _Stock Ownership of Millennium_. Neither Lyondell nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns any shares of capital stock of Millennium or any other
securities convertible into or otherwise exercisable to acquire shares of
capital stock of Millennium, other than as provided by this Agreement.

and does not hereby make, any representations or warranties, express or
implied, except as specifically set forth herein.

54 Affiliates and (ii) to any other persons who it reasonably believes may be
deemed to be "affiliates" of Millennium, as that term is used in paragraphs
(c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, pursuant to the Merger. __



Section 7.14 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, except
as expressly provided herein or as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties.



Section 7.15 _Indemnification and Insurance_



(a) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Lyondell shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law
each person who is, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an
officer or director of Millennium or Millennium Merger Sub (or any Subsidiary
or division thereof) and each person who served at the request of Millennium
as a director, officer, limited liability company member, trustee or fiduciary
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ "
and, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or
alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such, whether
commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time. In the
event of any such threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry (an " _Action_ "), Lyondell shall pay,
as incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Lyondell, in advance of
the final disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law (provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to the indemnification) and, if required, upon receipt
of any undertaking required by Applicable Law; _provided, however,_ Lyondell
or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and provided further, that Lyondell shall
not be obligated pursuant to this _Section 7.15_ to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
single Action, unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified
Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interests between two or more of
such Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be separate counsel for each
similarly situated group.



(b) The parties agree that all rights to indemnification and any
provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any action
or suit, whether contained in this Agreement or in the charter, bylaws or
other organizational documents of Millennium, Lyondell or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall survive consummation of the Merger with respect
to matters occurring through and including the Effective Time.



(c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Lyondell
shall cause to be maintained officers and directors liability insurance
covering the Indemnified



 

55 Parties who are, or at any time prior to the Effective Time were, covered by
Millenniums existing officers and directors liability insurance policies
on terms no less advantageous as a whole to the Indemnified Parties than such
existing insurance, provided, however, that if the existing insurance expires,
is terminated or canceled, or if the annual premiums increase to in excess of
250% of the sum of the last annual premium paid by Millennium prior to the
date hereof (the amount of each such premium being set forth in Section
7.15(c) of the Millennium Disclosure Letter), Lyondell shall provide as much
coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.



(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any
other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Lyondell or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Applicable Law or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 7.15_ shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit
each of the Indemnified Parties.



(e) In the event Lyondell or any of its respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Lyondell, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.15_.



Section 7.16 [ _Reserved_ ]



Section 7.17 _Employee Matters_



(a) Millennium and Lyondell each agree that all employees of Millennium and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be employed
by Lyondell or its Subsidiaries immediately after the Effective Time, it
being understood that Lyondell shall not have any obligations to continue
employing such employees for any length of time thereafter. Millennium agrees
that it shall not make, and it shall not permit its Subsidiaries to make, any
representations or promises, oral or written, to employees of Millennium and
its Subsidiaries concerning continued employment following the Effective Time,
or the terms and conditions of that employment, except as requested in
writing by Lyondell or with the prior written consent of Lyondell. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be considered a contract between Millennium, Lyondell its
Subsidiaries and any employee for such employees continued employment.



(b) Millennium and Lyondell further agree that the Millennium Benefit Plans
in effect at the date of this Agreement shall, to the extent practicable,
remain in effect in accordance with their terms until otherwise determined
after the Effective Time. To the extent any such Millennium Benefit Plan is
not continued, Lyondell will provide or cause Millennium to provide for a one
year period immediately following the Effective Time benefits to such
Millennium employees that are no less favorable (based on value), in the
aggregate, than the benefits provided by the Millennium Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Lyondell shall provide severance pay to any
employee (other than an employee who is listed on Section 5.12(e) of the
Disclosure Letter under the heading Certain Payments of Benefits) who is
terminated by Lyondell or any of its



 

56 affiliates during the one year period beginning on the Effective Time (taking
into account all service with Millennium and its affiliates prior to the
Effective Time as well as service with Millennium, Lyondell or any of their
affiliates after the Effective Time) that would have been provided pursuant to
the plans and policies in effect immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement and a copy of each of which (or, in the case of Foreign Plans, a
summary of or guidelines under which) have been provided to Lyondell.



(c) Millennium and each of its Subsidiaries operating in Europe shall (in
cooperation with Lyondell) use commercially reasonable efforts to comply
with all obligations under the national labor laws of any country in Europe,
the European Union labor laws or any applicable collective bargaining
agreements to inform and consult with the shop committee, workers council or
other employee bodies of such Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and
the resulting change in control of such Subsidiaries.



Section 7.18 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger, each of Lyondell and Millennium and
their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or by the merger and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation or such transactions. The Millennium Board shall take all actions,
including the adoption of any resolutions, as may be necessary or reasonably
requested by Lyondell to assure that any charter and bylaw provisions in the
nature of anti-takeover provisions, if any, are, and at the Effective Time
will be, inapplicable to the Merger.



Section 7.19 _Section 16(b) Board Approval_ __. Prior to the Closing, the
Millennium Board shall, by resolution duly adopted by such Board of Directors
or a duly authorized committee of "non-employee directors" thereof, approve
and adopt, for purposes of exemption from "short-swing" liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, (i) the conversion at the Effective Time
of the shares of Millennium Common Stock held by officers and directors of
Millennium into the right to receive shares of Lyondell Common Stock in the
Merger and (ii) the assumption by Lyondell at the Effective Time of the
Millennium Stock Option Plans. Similarly, prior to the Closing, a duly
authorized committee of "non-employee directors" of the Board of Directors of
Lyondell shall approve and adopt similar resolutions with respect to the
directors of Millennium that will be appointed to the Board of Directors of
Lyondell pursuant to _Section 3.3_ and any officers of Millennium that will be
deemed to be "executive officers" (under Section 16 of the Exchange Act) of
Lyondell at the Effective Time. Such resolutions shall set forth the name of
the applicable "insiders" for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the
number of securities to be acquired by each individual, that the approval is
being granted to exempt the transaction under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act and, for the Millennium Stock Options to be assumed by Lyondell at the
Effective Time, the material terms of the options and warrants to purchase
shares of Lyondell Common Stock acquired by such insiders as a result of the
assumption of the Millennium Stock Options by Lyondell.



 

57 Section 7.20 _Reorganization Treatment_



(a) Millennium and Lyondell shall execute and deliver to each of
Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, counsel to Millennium, and Baker Botts L.L.P.,
counsel to Lyondell, certificates substantially in the forms attached hereto
as _Exhibits 7.20(a) and 7.20(b)_ at such time or times as reasonably
requested by each such law firm in connection with its delivery of the
opinion referred to in _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ , as the case may
be. Prior to the Effective Time, neither Millennium nor Lyondell shall take or
cause to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue any of the
representations in such certificates.



(b) Millennium and Lyondell intend that the transactions contemplated hereby
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and the parties will take the position for all Tax purposes that the
transactions contemplated hereby so qualify unless a contrary position is
required by a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the
Code. Millennium and Lyondell shall each use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the transactions contemplated hereby
to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and shall not take actions, cause actions to be taken, or fail to take
actions that are reasonably likely to prevent such result.



Section 7.21 _Bank Agreement Amendments_. Lyondell and Millennium shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any and all amendments and/or
waivers under their respective bank credit agreements and the Lyondell
receivables securitization facility (or, in each case, replacements thereof)
as shall be necessary to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby without breach or violation of any such agreement or of any other debt
agreement to which either of them or any Subsidiary of either of them shall
be a party (collectively, the " _Bank Agreement Amendments_ ").

Proposal is still pending or has been consummated; or



(2) by Lyondell pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ ; or

then Millennium shall pay Lyondell a fee of $30 million at the time of such
termination in cash by wire transfer to an account designated by Lyondell;
_provided_ that, in the case of clause (2) above, no such fee shall be payable
if at the time of the Millennium Board action giving rise to the termination

expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on the

remedies of such nonbreaching party under this Agreement in the case of such a
willful and material breach, at law or in equity, shall be preserved.



(e) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of
the Merger pursuant to this _Article 9_ , Millennium shall promptly reimburse
Lyondell for 50% of the expenses Lyondell agreed to bear pursuant to _Sections

shall not be deemed to confer rights on any person other than the parties to
this Agreement. Each party hereby knowingly and intentionally, irrevocably
and unconditionally waives trial by jury in any legal action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement and for any counterclaim therein.

OF THE

SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK 

OF

MILLENNIUM CHEMICALS INC.

(Pursuant to Section 151 of the

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware)



We, [ _ _], President, and [ _ _], Secretary, of
Millennium Chemicals Inc. (hereinafter called the " _Corporation_ "), a
corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _GCL_ "), in accordance
with Section 151 of the GCL, do hereby certify as follows:



FIRST: The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation ( the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") authorizes the issuance
of up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value (the "
_Preferred Stock_ "), in one or more classes or series, with such voting
powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as may be stated and
expressed in a resolution or resolutions providing for the creation and
issuance of any such class or series adopted by the board of directors of the
Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ ") prior to the issuance of any
shares of such class or series, pursuant to authority expressly vested in the
Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation.



SECOND: The Board of Directors of the Corporation, at a meeting held on March
28, 2004, duly adopted the following resolutions authorizing the creation of
a new series of such Preferred Stock, to be known as " _Series A Preferred
Stock_ ," stating that 1,000 shares of the authorized and unissued Preferred
Stock shall constitute such series, and setting forth a statement of the
voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional
or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions
thereof as follows:



BE IT RESOLVED, that the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
as follows:



1\. _Series A Preferred Stock._  



1.1 _Designation_. The first series of Preferred Stock is designated and
known as " _Series A Preferred Stock_ " and shall consist of 1,000 shares.



1.2 _Rank_. The Series A Preferred Stock shall, with respect to dividend
rights, rank _pari passu_ to the common stock of the Corporation, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), and with respect to rights on
liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the affairs of the Corporation,
rank prior to the Common Stock. 2\. _Dividend Rights_. Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive such dividends thereon as are in the amount of twice the
dividends as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors per
share of Common Stock, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, the Board of
Directors shall not declare any dividend on the Common Stock without
declaring a dividend in the same form and in twice the amount per share on the
Series A Preferred Stock.



3\. _Liquidation Rights_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary,
no distribution shall be made to the holders of the Common Stock unless,
prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have
received a liquidation preference of $1,000 per full share of Series A
Preferred Stock. For purposes of this Section 3, neither the sale, lease,
conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or
other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property or assets of
the Corporation nor the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or
into one or more corporations shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation (unless such sale, conveyance,
exchange or transfer is in connection with a dissolution or winding up of the
business of the Corporation).



4\. _Voting Rights_.



4.1 _Series A Preferred Stock_. Each holder of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall have the right to one (1) vote for each share of Series A
Preferred Stock held of record on the books of the Corporation.



4.2 _Scope_. Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall have full voting
rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of
Common Stock, and shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders meeting in
accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation (as in effect at the time in
question) and applicable law, and shall be entitled to vote, together as a
class with the holders of Common Stock, with respect to any question upon
which holders of Common Stock have the right to vote, except as required by
applicable law. Except as required by applicable law, the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall vote together and not as
separate classes on any matter upon which such holders are entitled to vote,
including, but not limited to, any sale, lease, assignment, transfer or other
conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries, or any consolidation or merger involving the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries, or any reclassification or other change of any
stock, or any recapitalization of the Corporation as to which the stock of the
Corporation has the right to vote.



5\. _Miscellaneous_.



5.1 _No Preemptive Rights_. No holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall have a
right to purchase shares of capital stock of the Corporation sold or issued
by the Corporation.

_ day of _ _, 2004.
