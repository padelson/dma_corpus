charges of the Builder, if any) (the "Pre-Delivery Shipyard Payments"), then

has an effect on any other claims that may be made by or against the
indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the indemnified Party. 

---|---|--- 



     | 8.3.3 |

The indemnifying Party and the indemnified Party shall cooperate fully in all
aspects of any investigation, defence, pretrial activities,
trial, compromise, settlement or discharge of any Claim in respect of which
indemnity is sought pursuant to this clause 8.3, including, but not limited
to, by providing the other party with reasonable access to employees and
officers (including as witnesses) and other information. 

---|---|--- 



 

24 The indemnifying Party may not assume defence of any Claim unless (a) the
indemnifying Party gives written notice to the indemnified Party that the
indemnifying Party will indemnify the indemnified Party from and against the
entirety of any and all Losses the indemnified Party may suffer resulting
from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Claim,
(b) the indemnifying Party provides the indemnified Party with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the indemnified Party that the indemnifying Party
will have adequate financial resources to defend against the Claim and fulfill
its indemnification obligations hereunder, (c) the Claim involves only money
damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, (d) the indemnified Party has not been advised by counsel
that an actual or potential conflict exists between the indemnified Party and
the indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the Claim, (e) the
Claim does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with taxes or any
criminal or regulatory enforcement action, (f) settlement of, an adverse
judgment with respect to or the indemnifying Partys conduct of the defense of
the Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the indemnified Party,
reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the indemnified Partys
reputation or continuing business interests (including its relationships with
current or potential customers, suppliers or other parties material to the
conduct of its business) and (g) the indemnifying Party conducts the defense
of the Claim actively and diligently. The indemnified Party may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the
defense of the Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will pay
the fees and expenses of separate co-counsel retained by the Indemnified
Party that are incurred prior to indemnifying Partys assumption of control of
the defense of the Claim. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 8.3.5 |

If the indemnifying Party does not deliver the assumption of defence notice
contemplated above, or the evidence of financial ability to defend
and satisfy any Claim or otherwise at any time fails to conduct the defense
of the Claim actively and diligently, the indemnified Party may defend, and
may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to, the Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate
(and the indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from,
the indemnifying Party in connection therewith). If such notice and evidence
is given and the Indemnifying Party conducts the defence of the Claim
actively and diligently but any of the other conditions described above is or
becomes unsatisfied, the indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect
to, the Claim. In the event that the indemnified Party conducts the defense of
the Claim, the indemnifying Party will (a) advance payment to the indemnified
Party promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the Claim
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) and (b) remain liable for
any and all other Losses that the indemnified Party may incur or suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by
the Claim to the fullest extent provided in this clause 8.3. 

---|---|--- 



 

25 For all purposes of this Agreement, 

---|--- 



     | 8.4.1 |

the indemnifying Party shall not have any liability under clause (i) of clause
8.1 of this Section 8 unless the aggregate amount of the Losses for which the
indemnifying Party would be liable under this Clause is greater than (a) zero
for breaches by the Seller of any representation or warranty in _Section
5.2.6, 5.2.21 or 5.2.24_, and (b) US$400,000 for breaches by the Seller of
any other representation or warranty in _Section 5.1 or 5.2_ or for breaches
by the Buyer of any representation or warranty in _Section 5.1, 5.3 or 5.4
_(in any such case, the "Basket"), and then only to the extent that such
Losses exceed the Basket; 

---|---|--- 



     | 8.4.2 |

the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive,
and a claim for indemnity under this Section 8 may be brought, until 18

warranties set forth in Section 5.2.1 shall survive indefinitely; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 8.4.3 |

the maximum amount of any Losses that a Party shall be required to pay
pursuant to this Section 8 shall be equal to $62,750,000, except that with
respect to Losses by (a) Buyer arising from a breach of the representation and
warranty by Seller under _Section 5.2.1 or 5.2.15_ and (b) Seller arising
from a breach of the indemnity at _Section 8.2_, such maximum amount shall
be equal to the Consideration; 

---|---|--- 



     | 8.4.4 |

to the extent Buyer has established by agreement with the Seller or by a final
and unappealable judicial decision that Buyer is to be indemnified for Losses
pursuant to this Section 8, Buyer shall be entitled to set off the amount of
such Losses against any remaining principal amount of, or accrued unpaid
interest on, the Loan Note at that time and such principal or accrued
unpaid interest shall thereafter be reduced by any such amount of Losses.
Such setoff shall be effected automatically by means of, and upon, the
delivery by Buyer to Seller of written notice of such setoff, such notice
stating the amount of such setoff, the application to interest or principal
(as elected by Buyer in such notice), and the reason for such setoff; 

---|---|--- 



 

26 the amount of any Losses that a Party shall be required to pay pursuant to
this Section 8 shall be reduced by (i) any amount received by an indemnified
Party with respect thereto under any insurance coverage or from any other
party alleged to be responsible therefor and (ii) the amount of any Tax
benefit available to the indemnified Party relating thereto. The indemnified
party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under
such insurance coverage and from such other party alleged to have
responsibility. If an indemnified Party receives any amount under insurance
coverage or from such other party with respect to such Losses at any time
subsequent to any indemnification provided by the indemnifying Party pursuant
to this Section 8, then such indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by the
indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification up to
such amount received by the indemnified Party; 

---|---|--- 



     | 8.4.6 |

Nothing in this clause shall restrict or limit an indemnified Partys general
obligation at law to mitigate a loss it may suffer or incur as a result of an
event that may give rise to a claim under this indemnity. 

---|---|--- 



     | 8.4.7 |

A Party shall have no obligation to indemnify the other Party (a) for any
indirect or consequential liabilities, costs, expenses, damages or losses
(including without limitation loss of profit), or (b) in respect of a Claim
that arises or is delayed as a result of actual fraud, gross negligence or
wilful misconduct by the indemnified Party, their agents or advisers.  

---|---|--- 



     | 8.4.8 |

In the absence of actual fraud, gross negligence or wilful misconduct by the
indemnifying Party, THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS AND
REMEDIES OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE EVENTS
GIVING RISE TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED FOR HEREIN OR
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS OR
ASSIGNS SHALL HAVE ANY RIGHTS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY OR THEIR RELATED PARTIES
AFTER THE CLOSING DATE WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT
OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (including as
contemplated in Clause 8.2 above).
