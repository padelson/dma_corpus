position or agreement made or taken by any of the parties with respect to the

Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Transaction Consideration
Disbursement Schedule (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.6) and make
any adjustments necessary thereto consistent with the provisions of this
Section 2.8(b)(i), the determination of such accounting firm being conclusive
and binding on the parties hereto and the fees of such accounting firm being
borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer; _provided_ , that each of the
parties hereto reserves any and all other rights granted to it in this
Agreement.

Amounts set forth in the Buyer Post-Closing Statement, Seller shall promptly,
but in no event later than thirty (30) days following Sellers receipt of the
Buyer Post-Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "), deliver to Buyer
written notice describing in reasonable detail its dispute by specifying those
items or amounts as to which Seller disagrees, together with the Sellers
determination of such dispute items and amounts (a " _Dispute Notice_ ").

Buyer Post-Closing Statement and such statement (and the
calculations contained therein) will be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties hereto. During the thirty (30) days (the " _Resolution Period_ ")
after the delivery of the Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any such dispute and to finally determine the Closing
Date Balance Sheet and accompanying calculations. Any resolution by Buyer and
Seller during the Resolution Period as to any item identified in the Dispute
Notice shall be set forth in writing and will be final, binding and
conclusive. If Buyer and Seller are not able to resolve all disputed items
identified in the Dispute Notice within the Resolution Period, then the items

firm shall be instructed to, within ten (10) days, select an independent and
impartial partner from such firm shall act as an expert (the " _Accountant_

resolution, Buyer and Seller will each be afforded an opportunity to present

facilities and personnel of such party and its Subsidiaries as reasonably
necessary to perform its function. The Accountant shall act as an expert and
not as an arbitrator to calculate, based solely on the written submissions of
Buyer and Seller, and not by independent investigation, the items in dispute
and shall be instructed that its calculation (i) must be made in accordance
with the standards and definitions in this Agreement, and (ii) with respect
to each item in dispute, must be within the range of values established for
such amount as determined by reference to the value assigned to such amount by
Seller in the Dispute Notice and by Buyer in the Buyer Post-Closing
Statement.

(v) The Accountant shall be instructed to deliver to Buyer and Seller, as
promptly as practicable and in any event within forty five (45) days after his
or her appointment, a written decision setting forth its determination of the
items in dispute, each as determined in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. Such award shall be final and binding upon the parties to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and may be enforced in any court
having

 



 

14  jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, no party may
assert that any award issued by the Accountant is unenforceable because it has
not been timely rendered. The fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be
borne proportionately by Buyer and Seller on the basis of the discrepancy (in
dollars) between the aggregate value established for all disputed items by
each such party as presented to the Accountant and the aggregate value of the
final and binding determination of such disputed items by the Accountant.

(c) The final, binding and conclusive calculation of Working Capital, Cash
Amount, Debt Amount and Company Transaction Expenses as of the Closing based
either upon agreement or deemed agreement by Buyer and Seller or the written
determination delivered by the Accountant, in each case, in accordance with
this Section 2.8, will be the " _Final Working Capital_ ", " _Final Cash
Amount_ ", " _Final Debt Amount_ " or " _Final Company Transaction Expenses_
", as the case may be (collectively, the " _Final Amounts_ "), for all
purposes of this Agreement.

(d) On the third (3rd) Business Day after the determination of the Final
Amounts in accordance with this Section 2.8:

 

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, an amount in dollars equal
to the absolute value of such amount (plus interest on such amount from the
Closing Date up to but excluding the date on which such payment is made at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate, calculated on the basis of a
year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed) shall be delivered to
Buyer and/or the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Buyer from the Purchase Price Escrow Fund, and the
remaining amount, if any, in the Purchase Price Escrow Fund shall be released
to Seller to such account or accounts designated by Seller; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if the amount to be paid pursuant to the foregoing exceeds the
amount on deposit in the Purchase Price Escrow Fund, such excess shall be
payable to Buyer and/or the Company (as applicable) solely from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund; or

(ii) if the Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, an amount in dollars
equal to such amount ( _plus_ interest on such amount from the Closing Date up
to but excluding the date on which such payment is made at a rate per annum
equal to the Federal Funds Rate, calculated on the basis of a year of 360
days and the actual number of days elapsed) shall be paid to Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds and the entire amount on deposit in
the Purchase Price Escrow Fund shall be released to Seller, in each case, to
such account or accounts designated by Seller.

Buyer and Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver the applicable amounts due to Seller,
Buyer and/or the Company pursuant to the this Section 2.8(d).

 

2.9 _Withholding_. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of any such
payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller.

not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.2 _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the

Agreements by Buyer does not, and the consummation by Buyer of
the Transactions will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, any provision of the organizational

  

 

39  documents of Buyer, (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach
of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default
(or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, material amendment or
acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, require
a consent or waiver under, require the payment of a penalty under or result in
the imposition of any Lien on Buyers assets under, any of the terms,

Effect.

any Governmental Entity or any arbitrator, pending against Buyer of which
Buyer has received notice and, to Buyers Knowledge, no such Claim has been

its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions.

 

5.4 _Sufficiency of Funds_.

 

(a) Buyer has delivered to Seller and the Company true, accurate and complete
copies of executed commitment letters from the Lenders, dated as of September

amounts to be paid by it hereunder on and after the Closing Date and any
related fees and expenses.

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

7.1 _No Solicitation_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller and the Company
shall not, the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and Seller and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or

continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any information for the purpose of
knowingly encouraging or facilitating, any Acquisition Proposal, or (c) enter
into any Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Seller and the Company
shall, and shall cause their Representatives to, cease immediately all
discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and shall demand

furnished in connection therewith. Seller and the Company shall promptly (and
within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt) inform Buyer of the identity of any
person making an Acquisition Proposal during the Pre-Closing Period as well as
the nature and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal. Seller and the
Company shall promptly provide to Buyer copies of any Acquisition Proposals.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any
proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, sale of
substantial assets, stock purchase, recapitalization, share exchange or other
business combination involving the Company, (ii) any proposal for the issuance
by the Company of its equity securities or (iii) any proposal or offer of
which the Company is aware to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly,

its Representatives with reasonable access to the Companys key customers and
suppliers, so long as Seller or a Representative designated in writing by
Seller is permitted to be present. Any access provided to Buyer or information
provided by Seller or the Company shall not constitute any expansion of or
additional representations or warranties of the Company or Seller beyond
those specifically set forth in this Agreement. Buyer will hold any such
information which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and the
Company shall not have any obligation to provide Buyer with any such access
or information which, after being advised as such by outside legal counsel,
the Company concludes in good faith cannot be disclosed without violating

Seller shall (x) notify Buyer that such information cannot be disclosed
without violating applicable Law or Sellers or the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries obligations of confidentiality, (y) communicate to Buyer in
reasonable detail (A) the facts giving rise to such notification and (B) the
subject matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in

confidentiality, using reasonable best efforts to seek a waiver of any such
obligations of confidentiality.

46  sell, divest, hold separate, license or agree to any other structural or
conduct remedy (A) with respect to any Subsidiary, operation, division,
business, product line, customer, asset or relationship of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates or Subsidiaries (other than the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
following the Transactions) or (B) with respect to, any operations, divisions,
businesses, product lines, customers, assets or relationships of the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries other than, in the case of this clause (B), the
Specified Company Products and any marketed products that would represent an
amount of revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the twelve month
period ended June 30, 2010, in the aggregate for all such products, of one
million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) or less, or (y) commence,
defend, litigate or pursue, or threaten to commence, defend, litigate or
pursue, any Claim by, against or before any Governmental Entity, including in
connection with obtaining any clearance of any Antitrust Authority or any
termination of any applicable waiting period under Antitrust Laws or
otherwise. For purposes of this Section 7.3(a), " _Specified Company
Products_ " means any products or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the ANDAs therefor) that as of the date hereof are not
approved by the FDA under Subpart C of Part 314 of Title 21 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (as evidenced by receipt by the Company or a Subsidiary
thereof of a written approval letter from the FDA approving the immediate
marketing and sale of such product) and (2) not, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) Each of Buyer, Seller and the Company undertakes and agrees to file as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, a Notification and Report Form under the HSR
Act with the applicable Antitrust Authorities and to make such filings and
apply for such approvals and consents as are required under any other
applicable Laws as soon as practicable. Each of Seller, the Company and Buyer
shall furnish to each others counsel such necessary information
and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that may be necessary under the HSR
Act.

 

(c) Each of Buyer, Seller and the Company shall respond as promptly as
practicable to all inquiries and requests received from the Antitrust
Authorities in connection with Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws.
Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(a), Buyer, Seller and the
Company shall negotiate in good faith with all Antitrust Authorities in
connection with any matter referred to in Section 7.3(a) in order to
consummate, as promptly as practicable, the Transactions. Seller shall, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, agree, if, but solely if
requested by Buyer, to take any of the actions set forth in Sections 7.3(a)
with respect to the business, assets and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
shall be obligated to agree to any such action which is not conditioned upon
the Closing.

(d) In addition, each of Buyer, Seller and the Company shall, subject
to applicable Law use reasonable best efforts to, (i) promptly notify the
other party of any written communication to that party from any Antitrust
Authority or any other Governmental Entity, including health or other
regulatory authorities, in each case relating specifically to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the Transactions, and, permit the other parties to
review in advance any proposed communication to any of the foregoing, (ii)
consult with the other parties prior to participating in any meeting,
telephone call or discussion with any Antitrust Authority or

and participate in any such meeting, telephone call or discussion, and (iii)
furnish the other parties with copies of all material correspondence, filings,
and written communications between them and their respective Representatives
on the one hand, and any Antitrust Authority and Governmental Entity,
including health or other regulatory authorities, or members of their
respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may designate such
correspondence, filings and written communications as being provided on an
outside counsel basis only.

 

7.4 _Public Disclosure_. Buyer, Seller and the Company agree that all matters
solely related to the Transactions in the initial press release with respect
to the Transactions shall be reasonably agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
Buyer, Seller and the Company further agree to communicate with each other and
reasonably cooperate with each other prior to any other disclosure to any
third party (other than Representatives) of these Transactions. Buyer, Seller
and the Company agree that no disclosure shall be made to any third party
(other than Representatives), and no public release or announcement shall be
issued, in each case concerning the terms of the Transactions, without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except as such release or
announcement (including in any current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on
Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K required to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission or any report or other document required by
any United States securities exchange) may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange or other
Governmental Entity, in which case (unless otherwise required by Law) the
party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other
parties reasonable time to review such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance.

7.5 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) If the Closing occurs, Buyer and the Company agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in
favor of any officer, director or manager of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
in each case that is an individual (collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_
"), as provided in the Certificate, by-laws or other organizational documents
of the Company effective as of immediately prior to the Closing shall survive
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full
force and effect and be honored by the Company for at least six years after
the Closing. The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.5(a) shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Company Indemnitee to whom this Section 7.5(a) applies without the consent of
such affected Company Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Company
Indemnitees to whom this Section 7.5(a) applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.5(a)). If the Closing occurs, the Company
shall pay all expenses to any Company Indemnitee incurred in successfully
enforcing the indemnity or other obligations provided for in this Section
7.5(a).

 

(b) Buyer will cause the Company to provide, for a period of not less than six
(6) years from the Closing Date, the Companys current directors and officers
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Closing Date (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less
favorable than the Companys existing policy or, if



 

48  substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 200%
(two hundred percent) of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ that (i) Buyer may
substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to DandO
Insurance at a level at least as favorable as in the DandO Insurance, or (ii) if
Buyer does not make the substitution provided for in clause (i) above, then
the Company may substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with
respect to DandO Insurance at a level at least as favorable as in the DandO
Insurance for a premium not to exceed 200% (two hundred percent) of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement. If
the Company or Buyer, or any of their successors or assigns, shall (a) be
liquidated and dissolved, (b) consolidated with or merged into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (c) sell or otherwise transfer all or a majority
of its assets to any other Person, proper provisions shall be made so that the
continuing or surviving entity or Buyer, as applicable, and its successors and
assigns shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.5. The
provisions of this Section 7.5 shall survive the Closing and are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each indemnified party
described in this Section 7.5 and his or her heirs and representatives, and
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have had by contract
or by Law.

 

7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer
shall give prompt notice to Seller and the Company, and Seller and the
Company shall give prompt notice to Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure
to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur has caused or is
reasonably likely to cause, any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement
until the Closing Date, (b) any material failure of Buyer, Seller or the
Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, (c) the receipt by such party of any written notice or other
written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (d) the
receipt by such party of any written inquiry or investigation from any
Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to have an adverse
impact on the Companys ability to consummate the Transactions, or (e) to
Buyers Knowledge or Sellers Knowledge, as applicable, a Claim that arises
against or affecting such party (i) that, if it were pending on the date of
the Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to this
Agreement, or (ii) that would reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact
on the Companys ability to consummate the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
above, the delivery of, or failure to deliver, any notice pursuant to this
Section 7.6 will not expand, limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys
obligation to consummate the Transactions.

7.7 _Employee Matters_. For a period of one (1) year following the Closing,
Buyer shall cause the Company to either (i) provide the employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are employed immediately prior to the
Closing (the " _Covered Employees_ ") who remain employed during such period
by Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries with
compensation and benefits (excluding equity based compensation) which, taken
as a whole, have a value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the
compensation 



 

49  and benefits provided by the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof or (ii) provide or cause the Company (or, in such case, its
successors or assigns) to provide Covered Employees who remain employed
during such period by Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits (excluding equity based
compensation) which, taken as a whole, have a value substantially comparable,
in the aggregate, to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries. In addition, for a period of one (1) year following the
Closing, Buyer shall or shall cause the Company to provide Covered
Employees whose employment is terminated by Buyer or the Company with
severance benefits in accordance with such employees individual employment
agreement or, in the absence of any such agreement, in accordance with either
(i) the severance policy of the Company in effect immediately prior to
Closing, or (ii) the severance practices of Buyer in effect from time to time.
Buyer shall have no obligation and the Company shall take no action that would
have the effect of requiring Buyer or the Company to continue any specific
plans (except with respect to existing employment agreements) or to continue
the employment of any specific Person.

 

7.8 _280G Matters_. Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
provide Buyer with a copy of Section 280G calculations for its disqualified
individuals (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code). If any Person
would be subject to any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code,
then the Company shall provide such Person(s) with the opportunity to subject
any payments that could constitute a "parachute payment" pursuant to Section
280G of the Code to a stockholder vote in a manner intended to comply with the
stockholder vote requirements under Section 280G of the Code and the
applicable regulations and, if such Person agrees to subject such payments to
such a stockholder vote, the Company shall submit such payment to a
stockholder vote in a manner that satisfies Section 280G of the Code and
the applicable regulations. Prior to providing the Companys stockholders
with any materials necessary to comply with such stockholder vote, the Company
shall provide a copy of such materials to Buyer in sufficient time to allow
Buyer to comment thereon and shall consider any such comments in good faith;
_provided_ that the Buyer shall have a right to consent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld) to any description of compensation arrangements that
continue after the Closing Date.

7.9 _FDA Supplier Action_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall
give prompt notice to Buyer, if the Company becomes aware, that any Company
Partner has received a material observation in a Notice of Inspectoral
Observation on a Form FDA-483 that could result in a regulatory action
reasonably expected to have a material impact on such Company Partners
ability to supply the Company in accordance with past practices (an _"FDA
Supplier Action_ ").

 

7.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Debt Commitment Letters (provided that Buyer may replace or amend the Debt
Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as
of the date hereof), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in full

 



 

50  force and effect the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions applicable to Buyer in the Debt Commitment Letters that are
within its control, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect to
the Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters or on terms not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Buyer
and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. In the event
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters for any reason, Buyer shall
provide written notice thereof to Seller as soon as reasonably practicable
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event, but in no event later than the Final Date; _provided_ that
such obligation shall be limited to obtaining alternative financing on
comparable or more favorable terms, in the aggregate, to Buyer than as
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (as determined in the reasonable
good-faith judgment of Buyer). Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the lenders and any other Persons providing Financing to fund on the
Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the Transactions if all
conditions to Closing contained in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 are satisfied
or waived (by the applicable party that is the beneficiary of such condition),
other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing (but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such condition by the
applicable party that is the beneficiary of such condition); _provided_ ,
however, that in no event shall Buyer have any obligation to take any action
against any lender or other Person which would give rise to a breach of
the Debt Commitment Letters.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company agrees to provide to Buyer, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to provide
to Buyer, such cooperation that is reasonably requested by Buyer and that is
customary in connection with financings comparable to the Financing,
including:

 

(i) furnishing its officers and employees during normal working hours and upon
reasonable notice, to meet with the Lenders and their Representatives in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, drafting sessions,
due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with
the Financing;

 

(ii) reasonably assisting in the preparation of any customary offering
documents, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, private placement
memoranda, materials for rating agency presentations and similar documents
required in connection with the Financing (including requesting any consents
of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the
Financing and the delivery of one or more customary representation letters)
and all documentation and other information required by Governmental Entities
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001;

(iii) using reasonable best efforts to cause its independent accountants,
consistent with their customary practice, to provide reasonable assistance and
cooperation to Buyer, including accounting due diligence sessions, and
providing consent to Buyer to use their audit reports relating to
the Company, in each case on customary terms and consistent with their
customary practice in connection with the Financing;



 

51 (iv) facilitating the execution and delivery (effective as of the Closing) of
definitive financing documents required in connection with the Financing on
the terms contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters if and to the extent
necessary to be executed and delivered prior to Closing, including pledge and
security documents, subsidiary guarantees or other certificates, legal
opinions of the Companys counsel regarding customary corporate matters or
documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and reasonably required in
connection with the Financing (including certificates of the chief financial
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to solvency
matters);

 

(v) reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral including executing and
delivering any customary pledge and security documents, mortgages, deeds of
trust, control agreements and other similar certificates; _provided_ that no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such agreement,
document or pledge shall be effective until the Closing;

(vi) furnishing to Buyer and its financing sources the Company Financial
Statements, with such modifications as are necessary to render such Company
Financial Statements in compliance with Regulation S-X under the Securities
Act, and using reasonable best efforts to furnish to Buyer and its financing
sources all other financial information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Buyer and required in connection with the
Financing; and

 

(vii) causing the taking of corporate actions by the Company, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Buyer and consistent with
customary practice to permit the consummation of the Financing ( _provided_ ,
that neither the board of directors of the Company nor the board of directors
of any Subsidiary shall be required to approve any aspect of the Financing).

(c) The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon any private placement memoranda or similar documents,
or any materials for rating agencies, that include information about the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prepared in connection with the Financing,
and Buyer shall include in such memoranda, documents or other materials,
comments reasonably proposed by the Company. The Company shall not be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment or incur
any other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in
connection with any of the actions taken pursuant to Section 7.10(b) prior to
the Closing. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Representatives from and against all Losses and Claims actually suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith (unless such Loss or Claim is
the result of a breach (i) by the Seller of any of the representations and
warranties contained in ARTICLE III , (ii) by the Company of any of the
representations and warranties contained in



 

52  ARTICLE IV, or (ii) by the Company or Seller of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement). If this Agreement is terminated for any reason,
Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the voiding, termination
and/or destruction of all documents executed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with their cooperation in the Financing. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Companys obligation to reasonably cooperate with
Buyer in connection with the arrangement of the Financing shall apply to the
Financing solely with respect to the Transactions.

 

(d) All non-public information or otherwise Confidential Information (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreements) regarding the Company obtained by
the Buyer or its Representatives pursuant to Section 7.10(b) shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall
have the right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt Commitment Letters or any
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing, and/or substitute other
debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the
same and/or alternative financing sources; _provided_ that any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of
the Debt Commitment Letters or such definitive agreements that amends
the Financing and/or substitution of all or any portion of the Financing
shall not expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding
on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters. In such event, the term "Debt Commitment Letters," as used herein
shall be deemed to include the new commitment letters entered into in
accordance with this Section 7.10(e), and the term "Financing," as used herein
shall be deemed to include any substitute debt or equity financing obtained
in accordance with this Section 7.10(e); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters delivered on the date
hereof, the second sentence of Section 7.10(a), and not this Section 7.10(e)
shall govern with respect to the terms of any replacement financing to be
obtained after any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable as described
therein.

7.11 _Resignations_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall cause to
be delivered to Buyer duly signed resignations (including releases),
effective as of the Closing, of the directors and officers of the Company set
forth on Section 7.11 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

7.12 _[INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]_.

 

7.13 _Additional Financial Statements_.

 

(a) For each fiscal quarter ending on or after September 30, 2010 and on or
before the date that is forty (40) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause to be delivered within forty (40) days after the last day of such
fiscal quarter to Buyer an unaudited comparative consolidated balance sheet at
the last day of such fiscal quarter, unaudited comparative consolidated
statements of income and unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows, for
such quarter and the year-to-date period then ended, in each case, prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except that such unaudited financial statements shall
not contain footnotes and shall be subject to



 

53  normal and recurring year end adjustments that are not expected to be
material in amount, and in each case shall be prepared accordance with
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act (including for the comparable quarter
and the comparable year-to-date periods for the prior year) (collectively, the
" _Interim Financial Statements_ ").

 

(b) If the Closing shall not have occurred prior to January 31, 2011, Seller
shall cause to be delivered on or prior to January 31, 2011 to Buyer an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2010 and the related unaudited consolidated statements of operations and cash
flows for the period then ended. If the Closing shall not have occurred prior
to April 1, 2011, Seller shall caused to be delivered on April 1, 2011 the
audited consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2010, and the related
audited consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year
then ended. All such financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP, consistently applied throughout the periods involved, except (x) as may
be indicated in the footnotes to such financial statements and (y) that the
unaudited financial statements shall not contain footnotes and shall be
subject to normal and recurring year end adjustments that are not expected to
be material in amount, and in each case shall be prepared in accordance
with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act.

7.14 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. All agreements between Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the
one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date, and all obligations and liabilities
thereunder shall be satisfied prior to the Closing with the Company and its
Subsidiaries not being subject to any post-Closing liability or obligation of
any nature with respect thereto.

 

7.15 _Updates_. On or before the Closing Date, Seller may supplement or
otherwise update the Seller Disclosure Schedules with respect to any event,
circumstance or change that first arises after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement that would make any representation or warranty in Article III
or Article IV inaccurate if such representation or warranty were given at the
Closing (all of such updates, together with the Seller Disclosure Schedules
that were made a part of this Agreement upon its execution, is the "Updated
Seller Disclosure Schedule"). Each such update or supplement shall be given
effect with respect to the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 8.2(a)
(and for purposes thereof the Seller Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to
also contain each item in the Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule) but shall
have no effect for purposes of Articles X or XI or the rights to
indemnification set forth therein.

7.16 _Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, until the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books, records and
other documents pertaining to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in existence on the Closing Date and make the same available for
inspection and copying by the Seller or its Representatives (at the Sellers
expense) during normal business hours of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice. No such
books, records or documents shall be destroyed after the seventh (7th)
anniversary of the Closing Date by Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, without first advising Seller in writing and giving Seller a
reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof at Sellers expense.



 

54 7.17 _Third Party Consents_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the applicable consents and/or
waivers from the third parties to the Contracts listed on Section 4.4(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

Closing (with respect to Sections 9.1(b) through 9.1(e), by written notice by
the terminating party to the other party):

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; or 

(b) by either Buyer or Seller in writing ( _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not otherwise in material default or material breach of this
Agreement) if the Acquisition shall not have been consummated by (i) six (6)
months from the date of this Agreement (as such date may be extended pursuant
to this Section 9.1(b), the " _Final Date_ "); (ii) nine (9) months from the
date of this Agreement, if on the Final Date as determined in accordance with

Closing set forth in ARTICLE VIII shall be satisfied or waived or by their
terms cannot be satisfied until or immediately preceding the Closing (but
which conditions would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the Final Date);
or

(c) by either Buyer or Seller if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final, nonappealable Order or Law or taken
any other final, nonappealable action, in each case having the effect of

or

 

(d) by Buyer, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company or
Seller set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would cause the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 not to be satisfied and
(ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Closing Date by Seller or the
Company, as applicable or shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days
following receipt by Seller and the Company of written notice of such breach
or failure to perform from Buyer; or

been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by Buyer of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform from Seller.

there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer, the Company or
their respective officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates; _provided_

damages for any willful and material breach of this Agreement, and (b) the



 

57  provisions of Sections 6.2 (Confidentiality) and 9.3 (Fees and Expenses),
this Section 9.2 (Effect of Termination) and ARTICLE XII (Miscellaneous) of
this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, "willful and material breach" shall mean a material breach that is
a consequence of an act knowingly undertaken by the breaching party with the
intent of causing a breach of this Agreement (it being acknowledged and agreed
by the parties hereto that the failure to close the Transactions by any party
that was otherwise obligated to do so under the terms of this Agreement shall

9.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement

Escrow Agent and all filing fees pursuant to the HSR Act in equal proportion.

ARTICLE X

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

10.1 _Indemnification by the Seller_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this ARTICLE X, from and after the Closing, other than with respect to Taxes,
which shall be governed solely in accordance with ARTICLE XI (but which shall
be subject to Section 10.4(a)), Buyer shall be indemnified and held harmless
by the Seller in respect of any and all Losses relating to, arising out of or
incurred or suffered by Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, the Company) and their respective managers, officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_
") in connection with:

(a) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, as of the date of this Agreement or as of
the Closing Date (as if made as of the Closing Date), any Fundamental
Representation, or any representations of Seller in ARTICLE III, contained in
this Agreement;

 

(b) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing Date (as if made as of the Closing Date) any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or
other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, that is not, in each
case, a Fundamental Representation (other than those contained in Section
4.8, which shall be governed solely by ARTICLE XI);

(c) any failure by Seller or the Company to perform any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement; and

(d) (1) Claims resulting from the use of any Product and any attendant Claims
that are plead by a plaintiff in a product liability action (which may include
consumer fraud and economic loss but which may not include voluntary or
government mandated recalls or regulatory actions) and (2) any Claims relating
to or arising out of the matters set forth on Section 10.1(d)(2) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule.



 

58 10.2 _Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) All claims for indemnification made under this ARTICLE X resulting from,
related to or arising out of a third-party claim against a Buyer Indemnified
Party shall be made in accordance with the following procedures. Buyer shall
give prompt written notification to Seller (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ")
of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding relating to a third
party claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the
assertion of any such claim by a third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure to provide such notice shall not release Seller from any
obligations under ARTICLE X except to the extent Seller is materially
prejudiced by such failure. Such Third Party Claim Notice shall include a
description in reasonable detail (to the extent known by such Buyer
Indemnified Party) of the facts constituting the basis for such third party
claim and the amount of the Losses claimed, if known and quantifiable (the "
_Third Party Claim Amount_ ").

 

(ii) Except with respect to third party claims that may give rise to
indemnification under Section 10.1(d), which shall be governed by Section
10.2(a)(iii), within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Third Party Claim
Notice, Seller may, upon written notice thereof to the Buyer and such Buyer
Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense (so long as it is acting in
good faith) of such action, suit, proceeding or claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer; _provided_ , that, prior to Seller assuming control of
such defense, it shall first verify to Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified Party
in writing that Seller shall be fully responsible (with no reservation of
rights but subject to the limitations contained in Sections 10.4 and 10.5) for
all Losses relating to such Claim for indemnification and that Seller
shall provide full indemnification hereunder to the Buyer Indemnified Party
with respect to such Claim for indemnification. If Seller does not assume
control of such defense, Buyer shall control such defense. The party not
controlling such defense may participate therein at its own expense;
_provided_ that if Seller assumes control of such defense and Buyer reasonably
concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Buyer Indemnified Party and
Seller have conflicting interests with respect to such action, suit,
proceeding or claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to such Buyer
Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith shall be considered "Losses"
for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event
shall Seller be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one (1)
counsel for all Buyer Indemnified Parties. Buyer shall not agree to any
settlement of such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior
written consent of Seller. Seller shall not agree to any settlement of such
action, suit, proceeding or claim that does not include a complete release of
Buyer and all Buyer Indemnified Parties from all liability with respect
thereto or that imposes any liability or obligation on Buyer or the Buyer
Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Buyer Indemnified
Party. In the event Seller does not exercise its right to conduct the defense
against any such third party claim, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in such
defense and make available to the Buyer Indemnified Party, all such witnesses,
records, materials and information in Sellers actual possession or under
Sellers direct control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Buyer Indemnified Party.



 

59 (iii) With respect to third party claims that may give rise
to indemnification under Section 10.1(d) (" _PL Claims_ "), Buyer shall
retain control of the defense (so long as it is acting in good faith) of such
action, suit, proceeding or claim; _provided_ that if Buyer elects to
offer, and Seller accepts, the control of such defense to Seller, such
defense shall be handled in accordance with Section 10.2(a)(ii) above. Seller
may participate therein at its own expense. Until the amounts related to the
PL Claims that are determined on the Final Valuation Date are paid in
accordance with Section 2.7(b), Buyer shall not agree to any settlement of
such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of
Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
it being understood and agreed that following such date, Buyer shall not be
obligated to obtain Sellers consent prior to any such settlement. Each party
shall cooperate with the other party in such defense and make available to
the other party, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in
such partys actual possession or under such partys direct control relating
thereto as is reasonably required by the other party. In furtherance of this
Section 10.2(a)(iii), Buyer agrees: (A) to create a joint litigation committee
comprised of 3 individuals: 2 members designated by Buyer and 1 member
designated by Seller (provided that each of Buyer and Seller shall have a
right to designate an alternate member of the committee in the event that the
applicable designee is not available to attend any meeting of the committee)
for the purpose of providing Seller a meaningful opportunity to (x) ask
questions and understand Buyers strategy regarding the PL Claims and (y)
provide input for Buyers consideration with respect to settlement proposals
and other significant strategic decisions relating to the PL Claims and (B)
that the joint litigation committee shall be provided periodic updates on
significant developments and upcoming settlement proposals and strategic
decisions, such updates to be provided (x) with reasonable advance notice so
as to provide Seller the reasonable opportunity to consider such
developments, proposals and decisions and to provide timely feedback to Buyer
in advance of Buyers decisions and (y) if reasonably requested by Seller, in
person with a reasonable opportunity to hear directly from Buyers counsel or
other relevant consultants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (1) Buyers right to indemnification under this ARTICLE X shall not
be diminished or otherwise affected by any action of or failure to act by
Buyer in connection with the matters referred to in the preceding sentence (it
being acknowledged and agreed that this clause (1) shall not relieve Buyer of
liability for its breach of the preceding sentence), and (2) no such action
or failure to act shall be construed as a breach of or failure to perform any
of Buyers obligations under Section 10.5(b) _._ Seller hereby agrees that
time is of the essence with respect to this Section 10.2(a)(iii).

(iv) The party controlling the defense of a third party claim shall keep the
other party reasonably advised of the status of such action, suit, proceeding
or claim and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by
the other party with respect thereto.

 



 

60 (b) _Procedure for Claims Not Involving Third Parties_. If a Buyer Indemnified
Party wishes to assert a claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE X that
does not involve a third-party claim, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") which contains (i) a description and the amount
(the " _Claim Amount_ ") of any Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified
Party, (ii) a statement that such Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this ARTICLE X and a reasonable explanation of the basis
therefor and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount of such Losses. Within
30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
written response in which Seller shall (A) agree that such Buyer Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive all of the Claim Amount (in which case such
response shall be accompanied by instructions (in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement) to the Escrow Agent to release funds from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
to the Buyer Indemnified Party in an amount equal to the Claim Amount (or if
the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be less than the Claim Amount, the amount of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund), by check or by wire transfer), (B) agree that such
Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the
Claim Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ ") (in which case such response shall be
accompanied by instructions (in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) to the
Escrow Agent to release funds from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Buyer
Indemnified Party in an amount equal to the Agreed Amount (or if the Indemnity
Escrow Fund shall be less than the Agreed Amount, the amount of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund), by check or by wire transfer) or (C) contest that such Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claim Amount. If Seller in
such response contests the payment of all or part of the Claim Amount, Seller
and Buyer shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such
dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days following the delivery by
Seller of such response, Seller and Buyer shall each have the right to submit
such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the
provisions of Section 12.12. 

(c) The Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
environmental investigation, monitoring, clean-up, containment, restoration,
removal or other corrective or response action with respect to environmental
contamination (collectively, " _Response Actions_ ") unless such Response
Action is required under any applicable Environmental Law or by any
Governmental Entity, or is reasonably necessary to address potentially
significant risks to human health or the environment; _provided_ , that
Sellers indemnification obligation shall be limited to such Losses as are
reasonably incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party to meet applicable cleanup
standards under Environmental Laws or requirements of Governmental Entities.
Seller shall also have no indemnification obligations to the extent a
Response Action is triggered by a change in the use of any property to non-
industrial uses.

 

10.3 _Survival_.

 

(a) Other than with respect to matters relating to Taxes, which shall be
governed solely by ARTICLE XI (but which shall be subject to Section 10.4(a))
and claims made pursuant to Section 10.1(c), which shall be governed by the
following sentence, no claim may be made or suit or other proceeding
instituted seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 



 

61  10.1 unless a Claim Notice or Third Party Claim Notice is provided to Seller
at any time prior to March 31, 2012, except for (1) claims made pursuant to
Section 10.1(a) and claims made with respect to actual fraud (which, for
purposes of clarity, shall not include claims of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or concealment that are part of a third-party claim), which
will survive until the thirtieth (30th) day following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations and (2) claims made pursuant to Section
10.1(d)(1) which will survive until the twenty-fourth (24th) month anniversary
following the Closing Date. The respective covenants and agreements of Seller
and the Company contained in this Agreement required to be performed or
complied with prior to the Closing (each, a " _Pre-Closing Covenant_ ") shall
survive the Closing Date hereunder solely for the purpose of Section 10.1(c)
until March 31, 2012, and all other respective covenants and agreements of
Seller and the Company contained in this Agreement (each, a " _Post-Closing
Covenant_ "), as well as Pre-Closing Covenants to the extent they
contemplate performance following the Closing, shall survive the Closing Date
hereunder indefinitely or for such lesser period of time as may be specified
therein.

 

(b) If an indemnification claim is properly asserted in writing pursuant to
Section 10.2 prior to the expiration as provided in Section 10.3(a) of the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is the basis for such
claim, then such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive
with respect to such claim until the resolution of such claim. 

10.4 _Limitations_.

 

(a) No Buyer Indemnified Party will assert any claim for indemnification under
Section 10.1(b) until such time as the aggregate of all Losses that the Buyer
Indemnified Parties may have under Section 10.1(b) exceeds eight million
dollars ($8,000,000) (the " _Basket_ ") at which point the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to recover only the aggregate amount of all such
Losses in excess of the Basket. The amount of Losses that the Buyer
Indemnified Parties may recover pursuant to Section 10.1 shall not exceed the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and shall be payable solely out of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund (to the extent funds remain therein) pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , that Losses resulting
from breaches of any Fundamental Representation, any representations of Seller
in ARTICLE III, or from breaches of any representation or warranty that
constitute actual fraud (which, for purposes of clarity, shall not include
claims of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or concealment that are part of
a third-party claim) and Losses that are the subject of ARTICLE XI indemnity
shall not be limited to the funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, but
shall instead be limited in the aggregate to an amount equal to the net
proceeds received by Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) For purposes of this ARTICLE X, a breach of a representation or warranty,
including any Fundamental Representation, shall be deemed to exist either if
such representation or warranty is actually inaccurate or breached or would
have been inaccurate or breached if such representation or warranty had not
contained any limitation or qualification as to "materiality", "Company
Material Adverse Effect," "Seller Material Adverse Effect" (which instead
shall be read as any adverse effect or change, except in the case of the
reference to "Company Material Adverse Effect" in Section 4.6(a) which shall
continue to be read as "Company Material Adverse Effect") or similar
materiality qualifier and the amount of Losses in respect of any breach of
representation or warranty, including any deemed breach pursuant to this
clause shall be



 

62  determined without regard to any such limitation or qualification as to
"materiality", "Company Material Adverse Effect," "Seller Material Adverse
Effect" (which instead shall be read as any adverse effect or change, except
in the case of the reference to "Company Material Adverse Effect" in Section
4.6(a) which shall continue to be read as "Company Material Adverse Effect")
or similar materiality qualifier set forth in such representation or
warranty.

(c) Except with respect to (i) claims for equitable relief made with respect
to breaches of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and (ii)
claims relating to Taxes, which shall be governed solely by ARTICLE XI (but
which shall be subject to Section 10.4(a)), the rights of the Indemnified
Parties under this ARTICLE X shall be the sole and exclusive remedies after
the Closing Date of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and their respective
Affiliates with respect to claims under, or otherwise relating to
the transactions that are the subject of, this Agreement.

10.5 _Calculation of Losses; Mitigation_.

 

(a) For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under this ARTICLE X, the amount of such Losses will be
determined net of (a) all related reserves properly accrued and directly
related to the specific matter subject of indemnification on the Company
Balance Sheet or reflected in the Final Amounts and (b) the difference of (i)
any amounts actually recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Party under insurance
policies or under any third-party contracts listed on Section 10.5 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (" _Collateral Sources_ ") with respect to such
Losses  _minus_ (ii) the total of the cost of such recovery and, if
applicable, the reasonably expected increased cost of premiums for the
insurance policy under which the Buyer Indemnified Party recovered.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each of the
parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Losses relating to a Claim under the indemnification provisions set forth in
Section 10.1.

(c) If any indemnitor makes an indemnification payment with respect to any
Loss in accordance with this ARTICLE X, then such indemnitor shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all related rights and remedies
of the indemnitees under any Collateral Source against or with respect to
such Loss, except to the extent such subrogation is not permitted under the
terms of such Collateral Source or under applicable Law. Promptly following
such indemnitors request, the applicable indemnitee shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take all reasonably necessary, proper or
desirable actions (including the execution and delivery of any document
reasonably requested) to accomplish the foregoing; _provided_ , that, with
respect to any insurance policy that constitutes a Collateral Source, the
indemnitor shall be liable for any increase to the cost or expense of any such
insurance policies, including the deductible or any premium with respect
thereto. 

10.6 _Tax Treatment_. Buyer and Seller will treat any payment received
pursuant to this ARTICLE X or ARTICLE XI as an adjustment to purchase price
for Tax and financial reporting purposes.



 

63 ARTICLE XI

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

11.1 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 10.4(a) and this Section
11.1, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless the Buyer from and against any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for (i) any Taxes (or the non-
payment thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (determined in accordance with Section 11.1(b)), (ii) all
Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group
of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of Law in any jurisdiction), (iii) any Taxes or other
costs (including the loss of or reduction in Tax benefits or Tax attributes)
imposed on or incurred by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or the Buyer
Indemnified Parties as a result of the breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.8 for which a Tax Claim
Notice is provided to Seller at any time prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary
of the Closing Date (it being understood and agreed that the provisions of
Section 10.4(b) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the indemnification provided
for under this clause (iii)), and (iv) the breach or nonperformance of any
covenant or agreement on the part of Seller or the Company set forth in
Section 6.1(n). Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 11.1(a) for Taxes
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall not apply to the extent such Taxes are
taken into account in calculating Final Working Capital. In the event that
any indemnification claim under this Section 11.1(a) relates to a loss of or
reduction in a Tax benefit or Tax attribute, Seller shall be obligated to pay
Buyer in respect of such loss or reduction only when and to the extent that
such loss or reduction actually increases Buyers tax liability or actually
reduces Buyers Tax refund.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period:

 

(i) the Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that are imposed on
a periodic basis and not based on income or receipts (e.g., property taxes)
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the product of
such Taxes attributable to the entire Straddle Period and a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period that elapsed
through the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in
such Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the amount of periodic
Taxes imposed for such Straddle Period reflects different rates of
Tax imposed for different periods within such Straddle Period, the formula
described in the preceding clause shall be applied separately with respect to
each such period within the Straddle Period; and

 

(ii) the Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiary (other than those described
in clause (i)) attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed
as if such Tax period ended as of the close of the Closing Date.



 

64 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in calculating the
Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 11.1(a), any items
of income and gain that arise after the Closing on the Closing Date and that
are not in the ordinary course of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to arise on the day immediately succeeding the Closing Date.

(d) All claims for indemnification made under this ARTICLE XI shall be made
in accordance with the following procedures. Buyer shall give prompt written
notification to Seller (a " _Tax Claim Notice_ ") of any pending or threatened
federal, state, local or foreign income or franchise tax audits
or assessments which audits or assessments identify a potential Tax liability
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (it being understood that the mere
commencement of a Tax audit is not by itself sufficient basis for a Tax Claim
Notice) for which Seller would be required to indemnify Buyer pursuant to
Section 11.1(a), _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such
notice shall not release Seller from any obligations under this ARTICLE XI
except to the extent Seller is materially prejudiced by such failure. Such
Tax Claim Notice shall include (i) a description in reasonable detail (to the
extent known by such Buyer Indemnified Party) of the facts constituting the
basis for such claim and the amount of the Losses claimed, if known and
quantifiable, (ii) a statement that such Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification under this ARTICLE XI and a reasonable explanation of the
basis therefor and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount of Losses set
forth in the Tax Claim Notice. Seller shall have the right to assume control
of the defense of any tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating
to any claim for Taxes for which Seller would be required to indemnify Buyer
pursuant to Section 11.1(a) and to employ counsel of its choice, _provided_
that Seller shall provide written notice to the Buyer and such Buyer
Indemnified Party of its intention to undertake such representation within 30
days after delivery of such Tax Claim Notice. If Seller does not assume
control of such defense, Buyer shall control such defense. The party not
controlling such defense may participate therein at its own expense;
_provided_ that if Seller assumes control of such defense and Buyer
reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Buyer Indemnified
Party and Seller have conflicting interests with respect to such tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding, the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to such Buyer Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith shall
be considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall Seller be responsible for the fees and expenses of
more than one (1) counsel for all Buyer Indemnified Parties. The party
controlling such defense shall keep the other party advised of the status of
such tax audit or administrative or court proceeding and the defense thereof
and shall consider recommendations made by the other party with respect
thereto. Similarly, in the event Seller does not exercise its right to conduct
the defense against any such tax audit or administrative or court proceeding,
Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in such defense and make available to the
Buyer Indemnified Party, all such witnesses, records, materials and
information in Sellers possession or under Sellers control relating thereto
as is reasonably required by the Buyer Indemnified Party. Seller shall not be
entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes to the extent such settlement would adversely
affect the liability for Taxes of the Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary
for any Post-Closing Tax Period to any extent (including, but not limited to,
the imposition of income tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or
cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation
periods, the denial of amortization or depreciation deductions, or the
reduction of loss or credit carryforwards) without the prior written consent
of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, 



 

65  conditioned or delayed. Such consent shall not be necessary to the extent
that Seller has indemnified the Buyer against the effects of any such
settlement. None of the Buyer, the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries shall
agree to any settlement of a tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
that is the subject of a Tax Claim Notice without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

(e) Any indemnity payment payable by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Section
11.1 shall be paid within thirty days after the Buyers written request
therefor (or, if later, ten days prior to the date such Tax is required to be
paid), _provided_ that such request shall be accompanied by a copy of the
applicable Tax Return or a final audit determination and a statement
reflecting the calculation of the amount for which the Seller is liable.
Within thirty days following the receipt of a request for any indemnity
payment hereunder, together with a computation by the Buyer of the indemnity
amount payable hereunder, the Seller shall either (i) pay such amount in
immediately available funds in the manner designated by the Buyer or (ii) if
such amount is payable with respect to a Tax Return filed pursuant to Section
11.2(a) or (b) (other than Straddle Period Returns), request in writing the
Accountant to determine whether such computation and amount are correct. After
each party has had the opportunity to consult with the Accountant, upon
receipt thereof, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a statement from the
Accountant setting forth the determination by the Accountant of such
computation and the amount payable hereunder as an indemnity. The
determination by the Accountant in conformity with the provisions of this
Agreement shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. Within
five (5) Business Days after delivery to the Seller of the statement of
determination by the Accountant of such amount, the Seller shall pay such
amount in immediately available funds to the Buyer in the manner designated
by the Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
amounts payable by the Seller pursuant to this ARTICLE XI shall be paid, at
the election of the Buyer, out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance
with Section 2.7, and in the event Buyer so elects, Buyer and Seller shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to deliver to Buyer any amounts so owing.

11.2 _Tax Filings_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed, on a timely basis (in each case, at Sellers sole cost and expense)
all Tax Returns with respect to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for
taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax
Returns_ ") that are due after the Closing Date. Except to the extent of any
reserves for Taxes shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Seller shall pay,
or cause to be paid, all Taxes with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries shown to be due on such Pre-Closing Tax Returns.

 

(b) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall file, or cause to
be filed, on a timely basis (in each case, at its sole cost and expense) all
Tax Returns with respect to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (other
than Tax Returns described in Section 11.2(a)), including Tax Returns, if any,
for the Straddle Period (the " _Straddle Period Returns_ ") as well as all
Tax Returns for taxable periods beginning on or after the Closing Date. Except
to the extent of any reserves for Taxes shown on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes, attributable to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods (as determined in accordance with Section 11.1(b)) that
are shown to be due on Straddle Period Returns.



 

66 (c) Buyer shall not cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
file an amended Tax Return, or to modify any Tax election, of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. All Tax
Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(or portion thereof) that are prepared and filed pursuant to Section 11.2(a)
or (b) shall be prepared and filed in accordance with the prior positions and
practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries except as required by Law.

 

(d) Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of any Straddle Period Returns at
least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date thereof (giving effect
to any extensions thereof), accompanied by a statement calculating in
reasonable detail the portion of any Taxes shown as due on such return for
which Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 11.1(a) hereof. Seller
shall have the right to review such Straddle Period Returns and the
calculation of its share of any Taxes shown as due thereon prior to the filing
of such Straddle Period Returns. If Seller disputes the amount calculated or
any aspect of the Straddle Period Returns, Seller and Buyer shall consult and
resolve in good faith any issues arising as a result of the review of such
Straddle Period Return. If Seller agrees to the amount and the Straddle Period
Returns, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to Sellers portion of the
Taxes shown on such Straddle Period Return not later than three Business Days
before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for payment of Taxes
with respect to such Straddle Period Return. If the parties are unable to
resolve any dispute within fifteen Business Days after Sellers receipt of
such Straddle Period Return, such dispute shall be resolved by the Accountant
which shall resolve any issue in dispute as promptly as practicable and whose
cost shall be borne by the parties in proportion to their proportionate
liability for Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return pursuant to
Section 11.1. If the Accountant is unable to make a determination with respect
to any disputed issue prior to the due date (including any extensions
thereof) for the filing of the Straddle Period Return in question, (A) Buyer
shall file, or shall cause to be filed, such Straddle Period Return without
such determination having been made and (B) Seller shall pay to Buyer, not
later than five days before the due date (including any extensions thereof)
for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return, an
amount determined by Seller as the proper amount chargeable to Seller
pursuant to this Section 11.2. Upon delivery to Seller and Buyer by the
Accountant of its determination, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the
amount paid by Seller in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence
in order to reflect the decision of the Accountant. The determination by the
Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.

 

(e) Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors
and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund) pursuant to this
Section 11.2, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes reported on such Tax Returns and
in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods
relating to such Tax Returns. Buyer and Seller recognize that Seller will need
access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and
Tax records and information held by the Company to the extent such records and
information pertain to events occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore,
Buyer agrees that for a period of the later to occur of (i) seven years from
the Closing Date or (ii) the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (taking into account any applicable extensions or tollings), (A)
Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, dispose of or destroy
any of the business



 

67  records and files of the Company relating to Taxes in existence on the
Closing Date without first offering to turn over possession thereof to Seller
by written notice to Seller at least thirty days prior to the proposed date
of such disposition or destruction and (B) Buyer shall, in its reasonable
discretion, allow Seller and its agents and representatives (and agents and
representatives of its affiliates) to inspect, review and make copies of such
records as Seller requests from time to time, such activities to be conducted
during normal business hours and at Sellers cost and expense.

 

(f) Subject to Section 11.2(e), the Buyer shall pay to the Seller (a) all
refunds or credits of Taxes received by the Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and attributable to Taxes paid by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Period and
(b) a portion of all refunds or credits of Taxes received by the Buyer, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and attributable to
Taxes paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
Straddle Period (such portion to be allocated consistent with the principles
set forth in Section 11.1(b)), in each case, net of any Taxes imposed on such
refund amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall not be entitled
to any refund or credit of either of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to a carryback of a Tax attribute relating to any period ending
after the Closing Date, and, provided further that, in the event that any such
refund or credit of Taxes is subsequently reduced as a result of any
adjustment required by any taxing authority, Seller shall promptly pay to
Buyer the amount of such reduction.

11.3 _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all sales, use, transfer, gains, stamp,
value added, duties, recording and similar Taxes incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall each
be responsible for one half of the taxes covered under this Section 11.3 and
any expenses incurred in complying with this Section 11.3. If requested by
Buyer, Seller will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or such other
documentation.

 

11.4 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any tax allocation or sharing agreement or
arrangement, whether or not written, that may have been entered into by
Seller and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as to
the Company or the relevant Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, and no payments
which are owed by or to the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant thereto
shall be made thereunder, except to the extent such obligation is reflected
in the Final Working Capital.

11.5 _Tax Benefit Payments_.

(a) Subject to Section 11.5(c), on the Final Valuation Date, Buyer shall pay
to Seller an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Tax benefits actually
realized by the Buyer Indemnified Parties as of or prior to the Final
Valuation Date that are attributable to any Losses paid out of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund on or before such Final Valuation Date, and (ii) Buyers good
faith estimate of any other Tax benefits expected to be realized by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties after the Final Valuation Date that are attributable to
(x) Losses paid out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund on or before the Final
Valuation Date and (y) anticipated Losses with respect to PL Claims that are
pending on the Final Valuation Date in the amount of the Fair Value of such
Losses as determined pursuant to Section 2.7(b).

 



 

68 (b) On the Final Valuation Date:

 

(i) Subject to Section 11.5(c), Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to
the excess of (x) the sum of (i) the Tax benefits actually realized by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties as of or prior to such Final Valuation Date that are
attributable to the types of expenses set forth on Section 11.5 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Specified Expenses_ ") in the amounts included in
the determination of the Final Amounts and (ii) the Buyers good faith
estimate of any other Tax benefits expected to be realized by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties (including Tax benefits that are, on the Final Valuation
Date, the subject of any anticipated or pending administrative or court
proceeding) that are attributable to the Specified Expenses, over (y) the Tax
Benefit Advance; or

 

(ii) Buyer shall be entitled to receive from the Indemnity Escrow Fund the
amount, if any, by which the foregoing clause (i)(y) exceeds the foregoing
clause (i)(x).

Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to undertake promptly an Indopco study to
determine the maximum portion of the Specified Expenses that is permitted to
be deducted for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

(c) If a Tax Claim Notice pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(iii) has been provided
to Seller prior to the Final Valuation Date and the Tax Claim thereunder is
pending as of the Final Valuation Date, the amount of Tax benefits otherwise
payable by Buyer to Seller pursuant to Section 11.5(a) or 11.5(b)(i) (but not
exceeding the amount of such Tax Claim) shall be retained by Buyer. Any amount
retained by Buyer pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be paid
to Seller only to the extent that the Tax Claim is resolved and the amount so
retained exceeds the amount required to satisfy Sellers indemnification
obligation to Buyer with respect to such Tax Claim.

 

(d) The amount of any Loss paid out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund after the
Final Valuation Date shall be reduced by the Tax benefits actually realized
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties that are attributable to such Loss as of or
prior to the time of such payment. Any future Tax benefits realized by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties that are attributable to such Losses shall be paid
by Buyer to Seller as and when such future Tax benefits are actually realized
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

(e) For purposes of this Section 11.5:

(i) the amount of any Tax benefit shall be considered to have been
actually realized at such time as a Buyer Indemnified Party realizes such
benefit through a refund of Tax and/or a reduction in the actual amount of
Taxes which such Buyer Indemnified Party would otherwise have had to pay if
the Loss giving rise to such Tax benefit had not been incurred, as determined
by comparing (x) the amount of Taxes payable or Tax refund due (as applicable)
taking into account any Tax items attributable to such Loss and treating such
Tax items as the last items claimed for any taxable year and (y) the amount
of Taxes payable or



 

69  Tax refund due (as applicable) without regard to such Tax items; _provided_
, _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of any estimated
Tax benefit for future periods shall be based on Buyers Effective Tax Rate
in effect for the year in which such estimate is calculated ( _provided that_
the parties shall take into account any then enacted change in Buyers
Effective Tax Rate applicable to any year subsequent to the year in which
such estimate was initially calculated);

(ii) the amount of any Tax benefit payment shall be calculated without regard
to time-value-of-money (present value or future value) principles; and

 

(iii) in the event that Buyer Indemnified Parties incur a Tax liability
attributable to receipt of an indemnification payment from Seller, that
increased liability will be a reduction in the Tax benefit to be paid to
Seller.

(f) In connection with any payment by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this
Section 11.5, Buyer shall provide to Seller a written analysis supporting the
calculation of the payment in reasonable detail. Buyer shall give Seller an
opportunity to review any such calculation, shall provide Seller with any
documentation or information that Seller may reasonably request in order to
permit Seller to review such calculation, and shall work with Seller in good
faith to resolve any objections raised by Seller. In the event of a
disagreement that Buyer and Seller are not able to resolve, the Accountant
shall resolve such disagreement in accordance with the provisions set forth in
Section 2.8 hereof.

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or other
communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it
actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to this
Agreement may change the address to which notices and other communications
hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to this Agreement
notice in the manner herein set forth.

12.2 _Entire Agreement_. Except as set forth in Section 7.15, this Agreement
(including the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer Disclosure Schedule and
the other Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments
referred to herein that are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto,
or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof;
_provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms.



 

71 12.3 _Amendment_. Except as set forth in Section 7.15, this Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

12.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is
specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

12.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) as provided in Section 7.5
(with respect to which the Company Indemnitees shall be third party
beneficiaries), and (ii) the last sentence of Section 12.12 (which is intended
to be enforceable by the Lenders and their Representatives), this Agreement is
not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon
any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any person or to
otherwise create any third party beneficiary hereto;

12.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Buyer
may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in
whole or from time to time in part, to one (1) or more of its Subsidiaries,
but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

12.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the term or provision in question in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the
parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or
to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term.



 

72 12.8 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or .pdf transmission.

 

12.9 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. The parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provisions hereof. Whenever the context may
require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding
masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and
pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The word "Agreement," means this Agreement as amended
or supplemented, together with all Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto or
incorporated by reference, and the words "hereof," "herein," "hereto,"
"hereunder" and other words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any specific provision of this Agreement. Any reference
to "$," "U.S. dollars" or "dollars" shall mean the legal tender of the United
States of America. Any reference to any period of days shall be deemed to be

intention of the parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are
mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions,
the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this
Agreement shall be construed to be cumulative and that each representation,
warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement shall be given
full separate and independent effect. Without limitation to the foregoing,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in any
representation or warranty in this Agreement shall in any way limit or
restrict the scope, applicability or meaning of any other representation or
warranty made in this Agreement; _provided_ , that Sections 4.16 (Compliance
with Laws) and 4.17 (Permits) shall not be applicable to the matters addressed
in the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.8 (Taxes), 4.13
(Environmental Matters), and 4.14 (Employee Benefit Plans).

12.10  _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND INTERPRETED
AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF (OTHER THAN
SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW).



 

73 12.11 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one (1) remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

12.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. ALL JUDICIAL
PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR ANY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, SHALL BE BROUGHT IN ANY FEDERAL OR
STATE COURT LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK (THE "NEW YORK COURTS"). BY
