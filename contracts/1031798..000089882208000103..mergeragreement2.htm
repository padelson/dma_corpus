ARTICLE 2 
 THE MERGER

 

 Section 2.01. _The Closing_. __ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 8:00 a.m., Pacific time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 140 Scott Drive, Menlo Park, California 94025, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

 

 Section 2.02. _The Merger_. __ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, as soon as practicable after the Closing, the Company shall file with the Delaware Secretary of State a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in connection with the Merger in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, Delaware Law. 

 

 (b) The Merger shall become effective on such date and at such time (the "Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties that is specified in the Certificate of Merger). 

 

 (c) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law. 

 

 Section 2.03. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof: 

 

 (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.03(b), Section 2.05, or 2.06(b), each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $19.375 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"); 

 

 (b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and 

 

 (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value 

  CONFIDENTIAL

 

$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 Section 2.04. _Surrender and Payment._

 

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares that are not Company Restricted Stock Awards (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall be invested in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under Section 2.03, Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

 

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be by this Section 2.04, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2, each Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.

 

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is 

  CONFIDENTIAL

 

registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and
(ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 

 (d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2. 

 

 (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

 

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.05 in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

 

 Section 2.05. _Dissenting Shares_. __ Notwithstanding Section 2.03, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with Section 2.03(b)) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (such shares being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law; _provided_ that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of Delaware Law, such shares of 

  CONFIDENTIAL

 

Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.03(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of
such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice, instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relate to such demand, and Parent
shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, or to the extent required by Applicable Law, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any
such demands.

 

 Section 2.06. _Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards; ESPP._

 

 (a) At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Stock Option, Company RSU, Assumed Restricted Stock Award, and other equity-based award denominated in shares of Company Common Stock (each such award, a "Company Compensatory Award") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option, restricted stock unit award, restricted stock award or other equity-based award, as the case may be, denominated in shares of Parent Stock and which has other terms and conditions substantially identical to those of the related Company Compensatory Award (including any accelerated vesting provisions therein) except that (i) the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each such award shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the "Award Exchange Ratio"), the numerator of which is the per share Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of Parent Stock on Nasdaq over the five (5) trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the Effective Time occurs (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and (ii) if applicable, the exercise or purchase price per share of Parent Stock (rounded upwards to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise or purchase price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Award Exchange Ratio; _provided, however_ , that in no case shall the exchange of a Company Stock Option be performed in a manner that is not in compliance with the adjustment requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The Company agrees that the assumption and adjustment of Company Compensatory Awards in accordance with this Section 2.06(a) shall preserve the compensation element of each Company Compensatory Award as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless determined otherwise by Parent, each Company Compensatory Award that is held by a person who is not an employee of, or a consultant to, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Cashed Out Compensatory Awards") shall not be assumed by Parent pursuant to this Section 2.06 and shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and extinguished and the vested portion thereof shall automatically be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such 

  CONFIDENTIAL

 

Cashed Out Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the Merger Consideration, less any per share exercise price of such Cashed Out
Compensatory Award.

 

 (b) At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Restricted Stock Award shall automatically be cancelled, and each share of Company Common Stock subject to a Company Restricted Stock Award shall be converted into the right to receive restricted stock units with respect to Parent Stock in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.06(b) and the vesting schedule for such Company Restricted Stock Award. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, upon receipt from the Company of a list of holders of Restricted Stock Awards (including the number of shares that were unvested immediately before the Effective Time), Parent shall send or cause the Surviving Corporation to send to each holder of a Restricted Stock Award a letter of transmittal and, upon confirmation to Parents satisfaction that such list does not duplicate the shares held by stockholders of record provided to the Exchange Agent for payment under Section 2.04, shall grant each such holder a restricted stock unit with respect to that number of shares of Parent Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) calculated by multiplying (i) the number of unvested shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Award Exchange Ratio. Such restricted stock units shall vest in accordance with the applicable vesting schedule for such Company Restricted Stock Award. In no event shall this Section and Section 2.04 result in a duplication of benefits with respect to any Company Restricted Stock Awards. The restricted stock units shall include the right to receive dividend equivalents immediately upon payment of dividends to holders of Parent Stock and the other terms and conditions of such restricted stock units shall be substantially identical to the Company Restricted Stock Awards except to the extent necessary to reflect the fact that the restricted stock units are not actual shares of Parent Stock. The Company agrees that the conversion of Company Restricted Stock Awards into restricted stock units in accordance with this Section 2.06(b) shall act as the assumption of such Company Restricted Stock Awards. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.06(b), each Company Restricted Stock Award held by a Designated Employee (an "Assumed Restricted Stock Award") shall not be cancelled and converted into the right to receive restricted stock units pursuant to this Section 2.06(b), but instead each such Assumed Restricted Stock Award shall be assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 2.06(a) hereof. 

 

 (c) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption and conversion of the Company Compensatory Awards pursuant to this Section 2.06, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.06. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of any Company Compensatory Award an appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant to such Company Compensatory Award. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of common stock of Parent issuable upon exercise of the assumed Company Compensatory Awards promptly following the Effective Time (and in no event later than 15 Business Days after the Effective Time) and Parent shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such assumed Company Compensatory Awards remain outstanding. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Form S-8 registration statement shall not cover any Cashed Out Compensatory Awards. __

  CONFIDENTIAL

 

 (d) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to (i) establish an Exercise Date (as defined under the Companys 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (the "ESPP")) under the ESPP on the last day of the payroll period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time (but in all events at least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time) with respect to the Accrual Period (as defined in the ESPP) otherwise then in effect (the "New Exercise Date"); (ii) provide that no further Accrual Periods shall commence under the ESPP on or following the New Exercise Date; and (iii) terminate the ESPP as of the New Exercise Date. Each outstanding option under the ESPP on the new Exercise Date shall be exercised on such date for the purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. 

 

 (e) Subject to Parents compliance with the preceding provisions of this Section 2.06, the parties agree that, following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory Award or a Company Restricted Stock Award or any participant in any Company Stock Plan, or other Company Employee Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement shall have any right hereunder to acquire any Equity Interest (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (f) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions that are necessary for the assumption and conversion of the Company Compensatory Awards and Company Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to this Section 2.06. __

 

 Section 2.07. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. 

 

 Section 2.08. _Withholding Rights_. __ Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

 

 Section 2.09. _Lost Certificates_. __ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such 

  CONFIDENTIAL

 

lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated under this Article 2.

 

ARTICLE 3 
 THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

 

 Section 3.01. _Certificate of Incorporation_. __ The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit C hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law. 

 

 Section 3.02. _Bylaws_. __ The bylaws of the Company shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and as so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law. 

 

 Section 3.03. _Directors and Officers_. __ From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of the Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

ARTICLE 4 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 Except (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (other than as set forth in the forward-looking statements or as set forth in the risk factors contained therein) filed after November 13, 2007 or (b) as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Subsidiary prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows: 

 

 Section 4.01. _Corporate Existence and Power_. __ The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers required to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore delivered, or otherwise made available through the SEC, to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as currently in effect.

 

 Section 4.02. _Corporate Authorization_

 

 (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to the Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  CONFIDENTIAL

 

contemplated hereby, except for obtaining the Stockholder Approval, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock voting to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger
(the "Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any of the
Companys capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other
similar Applicable Law affecting creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

 Section 6.02. _Stockholder Meeting; Board Recommendation; Proxy Material_.

 

 (a) The Company shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as practicable

      CONFIDENTIAL 
--- 

 

after the date hereof, for the purpose of voting on the matters requiring
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that the Stockholder Meeting shall not be
held prior to April 4, 2008; and _provided, further_ that (i) if the Company
is unable to obtain a quorum of its stockholders at such time, the Company may
adjourn or postpone the date of the Stockholder Meeting by no more than five
(5) Business Days and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts during
such five (5) Business Day period to obtain such a quorum as soon as
practicable, and (ii) the Company may delay, adjourn or postpone the
Stockholder Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) the Company
reasonably determines that such delay, adjournment or postponement is required
by Applicable Law to comply with any comments made by the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement or otherwise. Subject to the occurrence of an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.03, the Company Board shall
make the Board Recommendation and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Stockholder Approval, and the Company shall otherwise comply with all
Applicable Laws applicable to the Stockholder Meeting. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 8.01, the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Stockholder Meeting and the matters
constituting the Stockholder Approval shall be submitted to the Companys
stockholders at the Stockholder Meeting whether or not (A) an Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred or (B) any Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise
submitted to the Company or any of its Representatives. Unless this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the Company agrees that it
shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of the Company any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of
the Companys stockholders with respect to the Merger at the Stockholder
Meeting. The notice of such Stockholder Meeting shall state that a resolution
to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger will be considered at the
Stockholder Meeting, and no other matters shall be considered or voted upon at
the Stockholder Meeting without Parents prior written consent. The Company
agrees it shall establish a record date (the "Record Date") for the
Stockholder Meeting that is approximately thirty (30) days prior to the date
of the Stockholder Meeting, _provided, however,_ that the Company shall
establish a Record Date that is no later than May 30, 2008. Once the Company
has established the Record Date, the Company shall not change such Record Date
or establish a different record date for the Stockholder Meeting, unless
required to do so by Applicable Law. In the event that the date of the
Stockholder Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or
postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that it shall implement
such adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company
does not establish a new record date for the Stockholder Meeting, as
adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by Applicable Law. In the
event that at any time (whether before or after the date of this Agreement)
there shall be instituted or pending any Proceeding initiated by any Person
challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay or otherwise directly or
indirectly restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend such litigation and to do all
things necessary, proper or advisable such that the Company shall not be
required to establish a Record Date that is later than May 30, 2008, and shall
not be required to change any Record Date that had been previously
established.

 

 (b) Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.03(d): (i) the Company Board (as it may be constituted on the date hereof) shall unanimously recommend that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the Merger (the "Board Recommendation") at the Stockholder Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement

      CONFIDENTIAL 
--- 

 

shall include the Board Recommendation; and (iii) neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall fail to make, withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, the Board Recommendation.

 

 (c) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall prepare jointly and the Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement (but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this Agreement) and as soon as practicable thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to mail to its stockholders the Proxy Statement (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days following clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC) and all other proxy materials for the Stockholder Meeting, and if necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws, after the Proxy Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies. The Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning the Company or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement before such document (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall include in such document any comments reasonably proposed by Parent and its counsel. The Company shall (i) as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and advise Parent and its counsel of any oral comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) received from the SEC or its staff, (ii) provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the Companys proposed response to such comments, (iii) include in the Companys written response to such comments any comments reasonably proposed by Parent and its counsel, and (iv) provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach
its obligations hereunder, or (iv) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the foregoing restrictions by any Subsidiary of the Company or
Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 6.03 by the Company. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be terminated, and
shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their Representatives to
continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public
information in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was
furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries to return or
destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information.

 

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 6.03(a), prior to the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative, may (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide __ unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in writing after the date of this Agreement, that did not result from or arise out of a breach of this Section 6.03 (other than any such breach that is unintentional and immaterial in effect), and that the Company Board believes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, but in each case under the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), only if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company Board, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

 

 (c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 6.03(b), unless the Company shall have notified Parent in writing at least three (3) Business Days before taking such action that it intends to take such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after it obtains knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party. In such notice, the Company shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication, offer, proposal or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with the same amount of prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal as the members of the Company Board are provided of such meeting. The Company shall, subject to Applicable Law, promptly provide Parent with any non-public information concerning the Companys business, present or future performance, financial

previously provided to Parent.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, at any time prior to the Stockholder Approval,

 

 (i) the Company Board, following receipt of and on account of a Superior Proposal, may make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but only if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company Board, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that the Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change, unless (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least four (4) Business Days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company attaches to such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement or a detailed summary of all material terms of any such Superior Proposal (which version or summary shall be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity of the Third Party making the Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments; it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions); and (iv) Parent does not make, within the Notice Period, an offer that is determined by the Company Board in good faith, after consulting with its outside counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to be at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal; and

 

 (ii) the Company Board may, in response to a material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances (other than an Acquisition Proposal occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement) that was neither known to the Company Board nor reasonably likely as of or prior to the date of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances, an "Intervening Event"), fail to make, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Board Recommendation (which shall

      CONFIDENTIAL 
--- 

 

be deemed to be an "Adverse Recommendation Change") if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the
Company Board, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the
Company Board to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ that
no fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances shall constitute
an Intervening Event if such fact, event, change, development or set of
circumstances resulted from or arose out of the announcement, pendency or
consummation of the Merger; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has (A)
provided to Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice
advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifying the facts underlying the Company Boards determination that an
Intervening Event has occurred, and the reasons for the Adverse Recommendation
Change, in reasonable detail, and (B) during such four (4) Business Day
period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent
to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for an Adverse
Recommendation Change as a result of the Intervening Event.

 

Nothing contained in this Section 6.03(d) shall prevent the Company Board from
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than a
"stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be
a Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms its Board Recommendation (x) in such communication, or (y) within
two (2) Business Days after requested to do so by Parent.

 

 Section 6.04. _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) give to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties, books, records, Contracts, Governmental Authorizations, documents, directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries during normal business hours, (ii) furnish to Parent and its Representatives such financial, Tax and operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request (including the work papers of Ernst and Young LLP upon receipt of any required consent from Ernst and Young LLP), and (iii) instruct its Representatives to cooperate with Parent and its Representatives in its investigation; _provided, however_ , that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (A) any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information, (B) such disclosure would, based on the advice of such partys counsel, result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege applicable to such information, (C) the disclosure of such information to the other party would violate confidentiality obligations owed to a third party and such confidentiality obligations were in effect prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, or (D) such disclosure relates to individual performance or personnel evaluation records, medical histories or other personnel information that in the Companys good faith opinion could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to liability. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company. The Company shall deliver to Parent, no later than the 30th day following the date hereof, the materials identified in Section 6.04 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 Section 6.05. _401(k) Plans._ Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the termination of any and all 401(k) plans sponsored or maintained by Company and shall provide Parent evidence that each of Companys 401(k) plans has been terminated pursuant to an action by the Company Board. 

 

 Section 6.06. _Employee Benefits and Service Credit_.

 

 (a) For a period of twelve months following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide the employees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees"), while such Continuing Employees remain so employed, employee benefits, excluding any equity compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements, that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, as those provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries during such period. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms the Change of Control Severance Plan and each Company Employee Plan set forth on Section 7.02(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement, _provided_ , that nothing herein shall restrict the ability of Parent or the Surviving Company to amend or terminate such Change of Control Severance Plan and such Company Employee Plans in accordance with their terms and Applicable Law. Following the Effective Time, Parent will give each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or prior service with any predecessor corporation that is recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time) for purposes of eligibility, vesting and accrual of benefits under any Parent Employee Plans (but not for purposes of benefits accrual under any defined benefit pension plan), except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable medical and dental plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Parent Employee Plan" means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or oral plan, agreement or arrangement, including insurance coverage, severance benefits, disability benefits, deferred compensation, bonuses and severance benefits (but excluding equity-based compensation plans and any contract, offer letter or agreement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with or addressed to an individual), for the benefit of, or relating to, the current employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries and with respect to which eligibility has not been frozen.

 

 (b) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 6.06 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create any right in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in any Company Employee Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued employment with Parent, Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, nor shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to continue or amend any particular benefit plan after the

      CONFIDENTIAL

consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement for any
employee or former employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any
such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and
Applicable Law.

 

 Section 6.07. _Company Rights Agreement; State Takeover Laws_.

 

 (a) The Company shall take all further actions (in addition to those referred to in Section 4.26(b)) reasonably requested by Parent in order to render the Company Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, and to cause the Company Rights to expire at the Effective Time.

 

 (b) If any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Applicable Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Merger, the Voting Agreements or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, and their respective Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

      | Section 6.11. _Director and Officer Liability_. 
---|--- 

 

 (a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.11(a), neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Current Premium"), which amount is set forth in Section 6.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 250% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Corporations judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 250% of the Current Premium. The

      CONFIDENTIAL 
--- 

 

provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time,
which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ that the amount
paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed the amount set forth on Section
6.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If such prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to
honor the obligations thereunder.

 

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to: (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"); and (ii) any indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement. From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified in any manner that could adversely affect the rights thereunder of any person benefited by such provisions. If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable, a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under any of the provisions set forth in clauses (i) or (ii) above, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

 

 (c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making

or proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary Consents or waivers from third parties, and (iii) the execution and

necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth

information, the Company and Parent and their respective counsel shall (i)

the extent practicable, provide the other party and its counsel with advance
notice of and the opportunity to participate in any discussion, telephone call
or meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to participate in the preparation for such
discussion, telephone call or meeting. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or applicable Foreign Competition
Laws, without the prior written consent of the other. The Company and Parent
may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.12

in this Section 8.01, materials provided to the other party or its counsel may

opposition raised by any Governmental Authority; (iv) use their reasonable
best efforts to defend on appeal any favorable decision on the merits in
United States District Court or through administrative procedures, including
but not limited to seeking to have overturned or set aside any decisions or
orders prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement after the parties have prevailed on the merits in United States
District Court or through administrative procedures, as the case may be; and
(v) use their reasonable best efforts to have overturned or reversed on appeal
any decisions or orders issued by a United States District Court or the
European Commission prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless Parent has received a written opinion
from outside counsel that such an appeal is unlikely to succeed.

 

 (c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third-party consents.

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in connection with the receipt of any necessary governmental approvals or clearances (including under any Antitrust Law), neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business in a specified manner, or permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets or business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or the conduct of their business in a specified manner.

securities of the Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the

within such thirty (30) calendar day period); or

 

(d) by the Company:

 

 (i) if prior to the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board authorizes the Company, in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.03(d), to enter into a binding definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal with a Third Party; _provided_ that the Company shall have paid any amounts due pursuant to Section 9.04 in accordance with the terms, and at the times, specified therein; and _provided further_ that in the event of such termination, the Company substantially concurrently enters into such binding definitive agreement;

 

 (ii) in the event (A) of a material breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement or (B) that any of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement shall have been inaccurate in any material respect; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or such inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Subsidiary are curable by Parent or Merger Subsidiary through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts prior to the End Date and within thirty (30) days, then the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d)(ii) until the earlier to occur of (1) the expiration of a thirty (30) calendar day period after delivery of written notice from the Company to Parent of such breach or inaccuracy, as applicable, or (2) Parent or Merger Subsidiary ceasing to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy, _provided_ that Parent or Merger Subsidiary continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy (it being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d)(ii) if such breach or inaccuracy by Parent or Merger Subsidiary is cured within such thirty (30) calendar day period).

 Section 8.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to each other party hereto; provided that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability for damages resulting from any willful or intentional breach of this Agreement; 

  CONFIDENTIAL

 

 _provided, however_ , that in the event that Parent or Merger Subsidiary
shall have any liability for damages resulting from any willful or intentional
breach of this Agreement, the liability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary for
such damages shall be reduced by any amount paid by Parent under Section
