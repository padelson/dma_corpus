SECTION 1.04. Consents of Third Parties; Certain Permits. (a)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Acquired Asset if an
attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party, would
constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of such third party,
would be ineffective with respect to any party to a Contract concerning such
Acquired Asset, or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller or,
upon transfer, Purchaser under such Acquired Asset. If any transfer or
assignment by Seller to, or any assumption by Purchaser of, any interest in,
or liability, obligation or commitment under, any Acquired Asset requires the
consent of a third party, then such assignment or assumption shall be made
subject to such consent being obtained. To the extent any Acquired Asset may
not be assigned to Purchaser by reason of the absence of any such consent,
Purchaser shall not be required to assume any Assumed Liabilities arising
under such Acquired Asset.

 

 

(b) If any consent referred to in Section 1.04(a) is not obtained prior to
the Closing, the failure of such consent to be obtained shall not (subject to
the parties' compliance with the provisions of Section 5.05) constitute a
breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained
herein, and Parent, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate (each at their own
expense) in any lawful and reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by
Purchaser under which Purchaser shall obtain the economic claims, rights and
benefits under the Acquired Asset with respect to which such consent has not
been obtained in accordance with this Agreement. Such reasonable arrangement
may include (i) the subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Purchaser
of any and all rights of Seller against the other party to such third-party
agreement arising out of a breach or cancelation thereof by the other party,
and (ii) the enforcement by Seller of such rights. To the extent, and only to
the extent, Purchaser is able to receive the economic claims, rights and
benefits under such Acquired Asset, Purchaser shall be responsible for the
Assumed Liabilities, if any, arising under such Acquired Asset.

(c) If any Transferred Permit is not transferred to Purchaser at Closing, or
any Permit issued to or owned, used or possessed by Seller that is used or
held for use in, or arises from, the operation or conduct of the Business is
to any extent not transferable to Purchaser under Applicable Law (such
Permits, the "Non-Transferable Permits" and, together with the Transferred
Permits, the "Business Permits"):

 

 

(i) Parent, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate (each at their own expense),
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and, without limiting the
agreements set forth in Section 1.04(b), in a manner that complies with the
terms of each Contract pursuant to which such Non-Transferable Permit is
granted, to transfer to or otherwise make available to Purchaser at the
Closing, for two years following the Closing, all the rights and benefits of
Seller under such Business Permit and access to all data packages (or the
equivalent thereof) necessary in connection with such Business Permit
(whether through subregistrations, sublicenses, supplemental Permits or other
arrangements) in order to enable Purchaser to sell and distribute
such products of the Business that are manufactured under such Business
Permit, using product labels used by Seller in connection with such Business
Permit, in substantially the same manner as such products are currently sold
and distributed by Seller;

 

 

(ii) at all times during such two-year period, each of Parent and Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such Business
Permit in full force and effect at the expense of Purchaser (other than, for
the avoidance of doubt, any attorneys' fees, internal costs and other similar
costs and expenses incurred by Parent, Seller or their respective affiliates
in the course of performing their obligations pursuant to this Section
1.04(c)); and

 

 

(iii) to the extent, and only to the extent, Purchaser is able to receive the
claims, rights and benefits under such Business Permit, Purchaser shall be
responsible for the Assumed Liabilities, if any, arising under such Business
Permit.

 

 

Purchaser shall indemnify Parent, Seller and their respective affiliates
and Representatives against, and hold them harmless from, any Losses arising
from, in connection with, as a result of or otherwise with respect to the
arrangements described in this Section 1.04(c), other than, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Losses with respect to which Seller or Parent has expressly
provided an indemnity to Purchaser hereunder and other than any Losses to the
extent constituting attorneys' fees, internal costs and other similar costs
and expenses incurred by Parent, Seller or their respective affiliates in the
course of performing their obligations pursuant to this Section 1.04(c).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.04(c), Purchaser
shall be responsible for all filing, administrative and other similar fees
payable to any Governmental Entity in connection with the arrangements
contemplated by this Section 1.04(c) with respect to any Business Permit.

ARTICLE II

 

 

The Closing and Purchase Price Adjustment

 

 

SECTION 2.01. Closing Date. The closing of the Acquisition (the "Closing")
shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth
Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00 a.m. on the fifth business day
following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted, waiver by the party
or parties entitled to the benefits thereof) of the conditions set forth in
Article VI, or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed between
Seller and Purchaser. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date". The Closing shall be deemed to be
effective at 11:59 p.m. New York time on the Closing Date.

 

 

SECTION 2.02. Transactions To Be Effected at the Closing. At the Closing:

 

 

(a) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser (i) such appropriately executed deeds
(in recordable form), bills of sale, assignments and other instruments of
transfer relating to the Acquired Assets in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser and its counsel and (ii) such other documents as
Purchaser or its counsel may reasonably request to demonstrate satisfaction
of the conditions and compliance with the covenants set forth in this
Agreement; and

 

 

(b) Purchaser shall deliver to Seller (i) payment, by wire transfer to a bank
account designated in writing by Seller (such designation to be made at least
three business days prior to the Closing Date), immediately available funds
in an amount in U.S. dollars equal to the Estimated Purchase Price and (ii)
such other documents as Seller or its counsel may reasonably request to
demonstrate satisfaction of the conditions and compliance with the covenants
set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 2.03. Estimated Working Capital; Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) At
least three business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a written statement setting forth its good faith estimate of the
Closing Working Capital Amount (the "Estimated Working Capital Amount"),
calculated in accordance with this Section 2.03. The Purchase Price payable
on the Closing Date shall be preliminarily adjusted in accordance with
Section 1.01 and the manner contemplated by this Section 2.03 as if the
Estimated Working Capital Amount was the actual Closing Working Capital
Amount. The Purchase Price as so preliminarily adjusted is referred to as the
"Estimated Purchase Price".

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 



 

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth its
calculation of the Working Capital Amount as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (the "Closing Working Capital Amount"). In no event shall any
actions taken by or relating to Purchaser or the Business following the
Closing with respect to the accounting books and records of the Business on
which the Closing Statement is to be based (including changes in any reserve
or other account) or with respect to the operations or results of the
Business be considered in the determination of, or otherwise have any effect
on, the Closing Working Capital Amount.

 

 

(c) During the 30-day period following receipt by Seller of the Closing
Statement, Seller and any of its Representatives shall be permitted to review
all books and records and other information of Purchaser and its
Representatives relating to the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement
shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 30th day following
delivery thereof, unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement with
the Closing Statement (the "Notice of Disagreement") to Purchaser prior to
such date which shall specify the nature of any disagreement so asserted. Any
Notice of Disagreement shall (x) specify in reasonable detail the nature of
the disagreement so asserted and (y) only include disagreements that are
based on mathematical errors or based on the Closing Working Capital Amount
not being calculated in accordance with this Section 2.03. If a Notice of
Disagreement is given by Seller in a timely manner, then the Closing
Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become final
and binding upon Seller and Purchaser on the earlier of (i) the date Seller
and Purchaser resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to
the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date any
disputed matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved
in writing by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (unless the parties agree in writing
upon an alternative nationally recognized independent public accounting firm,
which shall not be Purchaser's or Seller's or any of their respective
affiliates' independent accountants) (the "Accounting Firm"). During the
30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and
Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that
they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement. During such 30-day period, Purchaser and any of its
Representatives shall be permitted to review all books and records and other
information of Seller and its Representatives relating to the Notice of
Disagreement. If, at the end of such 30-day period, Seller and Purchaser are
unable to so resolve any such differences, Seller and Purchaser shall submit
to the Accounting Firm for resolution any and all matters that remain in
dispute and that were included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting
Firm, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, shall be instructed to render
its determination of all matters submitted to it within 60 days following
submission. Purchaser and Seller agree that they shall be bound by the
determination of the Accounting Firm. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over
the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall
be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Purchaser. The fees and disbursements of
Seller's advisors incurred in connection with review of the Closing Statement
and any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Seller, and the fees and
expenses of Purchaser's advisors incurred in connection with the Final
Closing Statement and any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Purchaser.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

 

(i) "Target Working Capital Amount" means $22.225 million.

 

 

(ii) "Working Capital Amount" means an amount equal to (a) the amount of
current assets of the Business, minus (b) the amount of current liabilities
of the Business, in the case of each of clauses (a) and (b), as indicated on
the Closing Statement and calculated in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
basis consistent with the application of such principles in the preparation
of the Financial Statements (it being understood that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in determining the Working Capital Amount
all Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities shall be deemed not to be assets
or liabilities, as applicable, of the Business, as demonstrated in the
illustrative calculation of the Working Capital Amount as of the close of
business on June 30, 2008 set forth on Section 2.03(d) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter).

 

 

(e) The Final Purchase Price shall be an amount equal to the Purchase Price
adjusted as follows:

 

 

(i) if the Closing Working Capital Amount is less than the Target Working
Capital Amount, an amount equal to the excess of the Target Working Capital
Amount over the Closing Working Capital Amount shall be deducted in
calculating the Final Purchase Price; and

 

 

(ii) if the Closing Working Capital Amount is greater than the Target Working
Capital Amount, an amount equal to the excess of the Closing Working Capital
Amount over the Target Working Capital Amount shall be added in calculating
the Final Purchase Price.

 

 

(f) If the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall, and if the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the
Final Purchase Price, Seller shall, within five business days after the
Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the parties hereto, make
payment to the bank account designated in writing by Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable, of an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to such difference,
together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest from
time to time announced publicly by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as its prime
rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed, divided
by 365, from the Closing Date to the date of such payment.

ARTICLE III

 

 

Representations and Warranties of Seller

 

 

 

Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser that the statements
contained in this Article III are true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date, except as set forth in the disclosure
letter delivered by Seller to Purchaser on or prior to the date of the
execution and delivery by Parent and Seller of this Agreement (the
"Seller Disclosure Letter"). The Seller Disclosure Letter shall be arranged
in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections contained in this Article III, and the disclosure in any section
shall be deemed to qualify other sections in this Article III to the extent
(and only to the extent) that it is readily apparent from the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies, applies or relates to
such other sections.

 

 

SECTION 3.01. Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Parent and Seller is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and Seller has full corporate power and authority necessary
to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
conduct the Business as currently conducted. Seller is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of
the Acquired Assets held by it or the nature of the Business make such
qualification necessary for it to conduct the Business as currently
conducted, except where the failure to so qualify has not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller
Material Adverse Effect. Seller has delivered to Purchaser true and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Seller, in each
case as amended through the date of this Agreement. Seller is a direct,
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Seller does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other voting securities or other equity
interests in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or
other entity that does not constitute a wholly owned subsidiary of Seller.

 

 

SECTION 3.02. Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. Each of
Parent and Seller has full corporate power and authority to execute this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is specified to be,
a party and to consummate the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by each of Parent
and Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or
is specified to be, a party and the consummation by each of Parent and Seller
of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Parent and Seller, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent
or Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements or the consummation of the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Each of Parent and Seller has duly executed
and delivered this Agreement and, prior to the Closing, will have duly
executed and delivered each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is
specified to be, a party, and, assuming the due execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by the other parties hereto and
thereto, this Agreement constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement to which it
is, or is specified to be, a party will after the Closing constitute, its
legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws relating to
creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.

SECTION 3.03. No Conflicts; Consents. The execution and delivery by
Parent and Seller of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it
is, or is specified to be, a party, the consummation by Parent and Seller of
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
and compliance by Parent and Seller with the terms hereof and thereof do not
and will not conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of
a benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements of any person under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Seller under (any of
the foregoing, a "Conflict"), any provision of (i) the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of Parent or Seller, (ii) any Contract to which
Parent or Seller is a party or to which the Business, Parent, Seller or any
of its properties or assets is subject, other than Assigned Contracts, or
(iii) any judgment, order, writ, injunction, legally binding agreement with a
Governmental Entity, stipulation or decree ("Judgment") or any statute, law
(including common law), ordinance, rule or regulation ("Applicable
Law") applicable to Parent or Seller or any of their respective properties or
assets (other than in connection with the transfer of Permits of the
Business), other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such
items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. No consent
or Permit ("Consent") of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Federal, state or local government or any court of competent jurisdiction,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or
instrumentality, in each case whether domestic or foreign (each, a
"Governmental Entity"), is required to be obtained or made by or with respect
to Parent or Seller in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the consummation of the Acquisition or
the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or compliance with the
terms hereof and thereof, in each case other than compliance with and filings
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended
(the "HSR Act") and in connection with the transfer of Permits of the
Business.

 

 

SECTION 3.04. Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal
Controls. (a) Section 3.04(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth (i)
the unaudited balance sheet of the Business as of December 31, 2007, and the
unaudited consolidated statements of operations of the Business for the
fiscal year ended on December 31, 2007 (collectively, the "Fiscal 2007
Financial Statements") and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
the Business as of June 30, 2008 (the "Balance Sheet") and the unaudited
statement of operations for the six-month period ended on such date
(collectively, the "Interim Financial Statements" and, together with the
Fiscal 2007 Financial Statements, the "Financial Statements"). The Financial
Statements (A) were derived from and are in accordance with the books and
records of Seller, (B) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby, and (C) fairly
present in all material respects the financial condition and results of
operations of the Business as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated, except that (x) the Financial Statements do not
include footnotes (and the disclosure required therein) and (y) the Interim
Financial Statements would be subject to normal and recurring year-end audit
adjustments, which adjustments would not be material.

(b) The Business does not have any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unasserted or otherwise) that would
be required to be reflected on a balance sheet of the Business or required to
be disclosed in footnotes thereto, in each case prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the application of such principles in
the preparation of the Financial Statements, except (i) as expressly set
forth in the Balance Sheet, (ii) liabilities incurred after the date of the
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of the Business consistent with past
practice, (iii) Excluded Liabilities and (iv) post-Closing performance
obligations under the terms of Transferred Permits and Assigned Contracts
that would not be required to be reflected on a balance sheet of the Business
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 

 

(c) Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries (including Seller) (the "Parent
Consolidated Group") have a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as such term is used in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of consolidated financial statements of the Parent Consolidated Group for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

 

 

SECTION 3.05. Title to Assets. Seller has good and valid title to all
the Acquired Assets, in each case free and clear of all mortgages, liens,
security interests, charges, easements, leases, subleases, covenants, rights
of way, options, claims, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind
(collectively, "Liens"), except (a) the Liens set forth on Section 3.05(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Letter (the Liens on such schedule marked with an
asterisk to be discharged prior to the Closing), (b) mechanics', carriers',
workmen's, repairmen's or other like Liens arising or incurred in the
ordinary course of business that, assuming that Purchaser pays all Assumed
Liabilities when due, individually or in the aggregate, do not materially
impair, and could not reasonably be expected to materially impair, the
continued use and operation of the assets to which they relate in the
operation or conduct of the Business, (c) Liens for Taxes or governmental
assessments, charges or claims of payment not yet due or that are being
contested in good faith and which constitute Excluded Liabilities, (d)
the anti-assignment provisions of any Assigned Contract to which Seller is a
Party and (e) zoning restrictions, easements or other similar restrictions,
so long as the same do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially
interfere with or impair the use of such Business Property in the manner
normally used in the Business (the Liens described in clauses (a) through (e)
above, "Permitted Liens").

SECTION 3.06. Real Property. Neither Parent nor Seller holds any fee or
other ownership interest in any real property that is used in the operation
or conduct of the Business. Section 3.06 of the Seller Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all
real property in which Parent or Seller holds any leasehold interest and that
is used in the operation or conduct of the Business (each such property, a
"Business Property"), which list also sets forth the date of the lease,
sublease, license or other occupancy agreement constituting each such
leasehold interest and the date of any amendments and supplements thereto
(collectively, a "Real Property Lease"), as well as the names of the parties
thereto. Seller has delivered to Purchaser true and complete copies of each
Real Property Lease. Each Real Property Lease is in full force and effect
and neither Seller nor, to the knowledge of Seller, any of the other parties
to such Real Property Lease has received or given any notice of material
default thereunder which was not cured within the applicable grace period, no
event has occurred which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time,
or both, would constitute a material default by Parent, Seller or any of
their affiliates under any Real Property Lease and, to the knowledge of
Parent or Seller, no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice or
the passage of time, or both, would constitute a material default by any
person (other than Parent, Seller or any of their affiliates) under any Real
Property Lease. The execution and delivery by Parent and Seller of this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be,
a party, the consummation by Parent and Seller of the Acquisition and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance by Parent
and Seller with the terms hereof and thereof do not and will not constitute
or result in a Conflict under any provision of any Real Property Lease. Each
Business Property is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable provisions of any agreements to which such Business Property is
subject, local zoning requirements and all other Applicable Laws. There are

trademarks and applications therefor, copyright registrations and all other
product names of the Business (whether or not constituting a trademark or
trade name) that, in each case, are owned, used, filed by or licensed to
Seller and used or held for use in, or arising from, the operation or conduct

Assigned Intellectual Property (other than ordinary course license payments
in respect of generally available desktop software). Seller's rights in and
to the Assigned Intellectual Property constitute sufficient rights in and to
the Intellectual Property used in the Business (other than Administrative
Assets) such that the rights in and to the Assigned Intellectual Property
transferred to Purchaser at Closing will be sufficient to enable Purchaser to
operate the Business following the Closing in all material respects in the
same manner as presently conducted by Seller.

transferred to Seller all ownership and other rights of any nature whatsoever
of such person in any Material Patent and no such person has a valid claim
against Seller in connection with the involvement of such person in the
conception and development of any rights in any Material Patent that could
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect Purchaser's ability
to exercise full rights of ownership of such Material Patent after the
Closing.

 

 

(f) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, the consummation of the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and the compliance with the provisions hereof
and thereof do not and will not conflict with, or result in any violation or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
rise to a right of termination, cancelation or acceleration of any material
Assigned Intellectual Property right or obligation relating to any material
Assigned Intellectual Property set forth in any Contract to which Seller is a
party, or to a loss of any material benefit related thereto, or result in the
creation of any Lien in or upon any Assigned Intellectual Property related
thereto, or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements of any person relating to material Assigned
Intellectual Property under any such Contract, or result in the creation of
any Lien on any material Assigned Intellectual Property.

 

 

(g) Section 3.07(g) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all options, rights, licenses or interests of any kind
relating to Assigned Intellectual Property granted (i) to Seller (other than

by Seller in the ordinary course of business), or (ii) by Seller to any other

immediately preceding sentence (such Contracts, "Material Licenses") are
valid, binding and in full force and effect and are enforceable by Seller
in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
laws relating to creditors' rights generally and to general principles
of equity. Seller has performed all material obligations required to
be performed by it to date under each Material License and it is not (with
or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or
default in any material respect thereunder and, to the knowledge of Parent or
Seller as of the date of this Agreement, no other party to any Material

compensation or benefits to any employee of the Business (each such
arrangement described in this sentence is referred to herein as a "Seller
Benefit Plan"). Each Seller Benefit Plan or portion thereof that Purchaser
or any of its affiliates has explicitly agreed to assume pursuant to this

respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan (except routine claims for benefits

of the Code have received a favorable determination letter from the IRS (or
an application is pending) as to their qualification under Sections 401(a)

expected to cause the Seller 401(k) Plan or corresponding trust to fail to
qualify under Section 401(a) or 501(a) of the Code.

 

 

(c) No Seller Benefit Plan is subject to Title W of ERISA or Section 412 of

or (vi) is, or at any time will become, entitled to any payment, benefit or
right, or any increased and/or accelerated payment, benefit or right, as a

all such information and reasonable assistance as may be reasonably required
in order to effectuate the foregoing actions.

Ancillary Agreements, provided that nothing in this Section 5.05(f) shall be
deemed to require that any party take any action that would result in the
waiver of any attorney-client privilege. To the extent reasonably
practicable, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall independently participate in
a telephone call or meeting with a Governmental Entity regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby or any of the matters described in this
Section 5.05 without using its commercially reasonable efforts to give the
other prior notification of the call or meeting and, unless prohibited by
such Governmental Entity or not reasonably practicable, the opportunity to
attend and participate.

 

 

SECTION 5.06. Expenses. Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except
as expressly set forth in the last sentence of Section 1.04(c), in Section
2.03(c) and in Article VIII, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense, including all costs and expenses incurred pursuant to Sections 1.04
and 5.05.

SECTION 5.07. Employee Matters. (a) (i) From and after the date that there
has been a public announcement of this Agreement, and subject to Applicable
Laws, Seller shall provide Purchaser with reasonable access, upon reasonable
prior notice and during normal business hours, to the employees of Seller and
the properties and personnel records (including performance appraisals,
disciplinary actions, grievances and medical records) of the Business
Effective as of 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, make offers of employment
to each employee of Seller who provides services primarily with respect to
the Business (each such employee, a "Business Employee"), other than those
individuals identified on Section 5.07(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
provided that such Business Employee is actively employed by Seller in the
conduct of the Business as of the Closing. Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its affiliates to, offer employment to each Business Employee who is not
actively employed in the conduct of the Business as of the Closing Date due
to approved leave of absence, vacation or absence due to short-term
disability, provided that such Business Employee presents himself or herself
for active employment with Purchaser and its affiliates in the conduct of the
Business, and provided further that, except as may otherwise be required
under Applicable Laws, Purchaser shall not be required to, and shall not be
required to cause its affiliates to, offer employment to any such Business
Employee who does not present himself or herself for active employment prior
to the sixth month anniversary of the Closing. The Business Employees who
accept such offer of employment and transfer to Purchaser or its affiliates
(such employees, the "Transferred Employees") shall commence employment with
Purchaser or one of its affiliates (i) in the case of Transferred Employees
actively employed in the conduct of the Business as of the Closing Date, as
of 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date and (ii) in the case
of any Transferred Employee who is not actively employed in the conduct of
the Business as of the Closing Date due to approved leave of absence,
approved leave for short-term disability or approved vacation, the date that
such Business Employee commences active employment with Purchaser or its
affiliates (such time with respect to each Business Employee, the "Transfer
Time"). Purchaser's or its affiliates' offers of employment to each Business
Employee shall provide, in each case for a period of at least twelve months
following the Closing Date, (i) the same level of base salary provided to
such employee immediately prior to the Transfer Time and (ii) other employee
benefits (not including equity-based compensation) substantially similar in
the aggregate to those provided by Purchaser to its similarly situated
employees in the same or similar geographic areas; provided that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Purchaser nor
its affiliates shall be required to provide any Transferred Employee with
employee benefits that are considered by Purchaser to be grandfathered
benefits under benefit plans, policies, programs or agreements sponsored,
maintained or entered into by Purchaser or its affiliates. Purchaser shall,
or shall cause its affiliates to, provide severance benefits to any
Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated within twelve months
after the Closing Date in an amount no less favorable than would have been
provided to such Transferred Employee under Seller's severance plan covering
such employees as in effect immediately prior to the Transfer Time to the
extent such severance plan was provided by Seller to Purchaser prior to the
date of this Agreement.

(ii) Purchaser shall assume each employment agreement set forth on Schedule
5.07(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (each, an "Assumed
Employment Agreement"), provided that the Business Employee whose employment
with Seller is covered by such employment agreement becomes a Transferred
Employee, and provided further that Seller shall retain responsibility for
all liabilities and obligations arising prior to the Closing under the
Assumed Employment Agreements. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, in no event shall a Transferred Employee whose employment is
covered under an Assumed Employment Agreement be entitled to severance
benefits from Purchaser and its affiliates that are in excess of the
severance benefits provided under his or her Assumed Employment Agreement.

 

 

 

(iii) Section 5.07(a)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth (A) the
annual cash bonus and commission arrangements covering employees of the
Business in respect of Seller's 2008 fiscal year (collectively, the "Bonus
Plans"), (B) the performance targets under each such Bonus Plan and (C) in
the case of the Rockwood Performance Bonus Plan, the target bonus percentages
that each employee of the Business is eligible to receive under such
Bonus Plan. Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay to
the Transferred Employees such amounts with respect to the Bonus Plans as
are reflected as a current liability on the Closing Statement and taken into
account in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital Amount; provided
that Purchaser shall be required to pay any such amount only to the extent
that Purchaser determines in its sole discretion that the Transferred
Employees would have become entitled to such amount under the applicable
Bonus Plan if the Transferred Employees had remained employed by Seller and
its affiliates through the end of Seller's 2008 fiscal year. Any amounts
payable by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.07(a)(iii) shall be paid at
such times, in such manner and subject to such conditions as such amounts
would have been payable under the applicable Bonus Plan.

 

 

(b) With respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained for the benefit of
Transferred Employees or their eligible dependents following the Transfer
Time, Purchaser shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions and actively-at-work requirements with respect to
participation and coverage, to the extent waived or satisfied under the
Seller Benefit Plans at the Transfer Time, and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims
incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, such Transferred
Employees or their eligible dependents prior to the Transfer Time in the plan
year in which the Transfer Time occurs for purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any similar
welfare benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Purchaser or its affiliates
in which such Transferred Employees or their eligible dependents participate
following the Transfer Time.

 

 

(c) Purchaser shall give, or cause its affiliates to give, each Transferred
Employee credit for such Transferred Employee's service with Seller and its
affiliates prior to the Closing for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting
(but not for purposes of benefit accrual, early retirement subsidies or
employer contributions under the Purchaser 401(k) Plan) under any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Purchaser and its
affiliates that covers Transferred Employees after the Closing Date and (ii)
entitlements under vacation, sick leave and severance policies; provided in
each case that service with Seller and its affiliates prior to the Closing
shall be recognized only to the extent that such service would have been
recognized under a similar plan, program or arrangement maintained by Seller
and its affiliates and will not result in a duplication of benefits.

(d) Seller shall be responsible for providing continuation coverage, within
the meaning of the continuation coverage requirement of Section 601 et seq.
of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code (collectively, "COBRA"), as
is required pursuant to COBRA, in respect of any employee of Seller or
any "qualified beneficiary" (as defined in COBRA) of any such employee who
incurs a "qualifying event" (as defined in COBRA) at or prior to the
Transfer Time. Purchaser shall be responsible for providing such
continuation coverage as is required under COBRA in respect of any
Transferred Employee or any qualified beneficiary of a Transferred Employee,
in each case, who incurs a qualifying event following the Transfer Time.

 

 

(e) Seller shall be responsible for all reimbursement claims (such as medical
and dental claims) for expenses incurred, and for all non-reimbursement
claims (such as life insurance claims) incurred, under any Seller Benefit
Plans that are "employee welfare benefit plans" (within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA) (i) at any time by any employees of Seller that are
not Transferred Employees (and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries)
and (ii) at or prior to the Transfer Time by Transferred Employees (and their
eligible dependents and beneficiaries). Purchaser shall be responsible for
all reimbursement claims (such as medical and dental claims) for expenses
incurred, and for all non-reimbursement claims (such as life insurance
claims) incurred following the Transfer Time by any Transferred Employees
(and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries) under any welfare benefit
plans of Purchaser or its affiliates. For purposes of this Section 5.07(d), a
claim shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (1) life, accidental death
and dismemberment, disability and business travel accident insurance
benefits, upon the death, accident or illness giving rise to such benefits
and (2) health, dental and prescription drug benefits (including in respect
of any hospital confinement), upon the provision of the related services,
materials or supplies.

 

 

(f) (i) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall have in effect (or shall
cause one of its affiliates to have in effect) a defined contribution plan
that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Purchaser 401(k) Plan") that will provide
benefits to Transferred Employees participating in the Profit Sharing/401(k)
Plan for Employees of Rockwood Specialties Inc. (the "Seller 401(k) Plan").
Seller shall cause each Transferred Employee to become fully vested as of the
Closing Date in his or her account balance under Seller 401(k) Plan. Each
Transferred Employee participating in the Seller 401(k) Plan as of the
Transfer Time shall become a participant in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan
immediately following the Transfer Time. The accounts of Transferred
Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plan shall be distributable according to
the terms of the Seller 401(k) Plan. Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser
401(k) Plan to accept "direct rollovers" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of distributions from the Seller 401(k) Plan to
Transferred Employees (including direct rollovers of outstanding loans and
any promissory notes or other documents evidencing such loans), if such
rollovers are elected in accordance with the terms of the Seller 401(k) Plan
and Applicable Law by such Transferred Employees, subject to Purchaser's
satisfaction that (x) the Seller 401(k) Plan is in compliance with all
Applicable Laws, (y) such plan continues to satisfy the requirements for a
qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, and (z) the trust that forms
a part of such plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code.

(ii) With respect to each Transferred Employee who is a participant in the
Seller 401(k) Plan on the Closing Date and who continues employment with
Purchaser through December 31, 2008, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount
equal to the product of (x) the "covered compensation" under the Seller
401(k) Plan earned by such Transferred Employee from the beginning of the
Seller 401(k) Plan's 2008 plan year through the Closing Date and (y) the
"Applicable Percentage". The "Applicable Percentage" shall mean the profit
sharing contribution percentage up to a maximum of 4% of a Transferred
Employee's covered compensation, as determined by Seller in its sole
discretion, that would have been made by Seller with respect to the
Transferred Employee for the Seller 401(k) Plan's 2008 plan year if
the Transferred Employee had remained employed by Seller and its affiliates
through the end of the Seller 401(k) Plan's 2008 plan year. The
aggregate amount, if any, payable with respect to Transferred Employees
pursuant to this Section 5.07(f)(ii) (the "Seller PSP Contribution") shall
be paid to Purchaser as soon as practicable (but no more than thirty (30)
days) after the date that Seller determines to make profit sharing
contributions under the Seller 401(k) Plan with respect to the 2008 plan year
for the benefit of employees of Seller and its affiliates who do not become
Transferred Employees. Each Transferred Employee's allocable share of the
Seller PSP Contribution shall be credited by Purchaser to the Transferred
Employee under the applicable tax-qualified retirement plan maintained by
Purchaser.

 

 

(iii) Seller shall cause each Transferred Employee to become fully vested as
of the Closing Date in his or her account balance under the Rockwood
Specialties Inc. Money Purchase Pension Plan (the "Seller MPP"). With
respect to each Transferred Employee who is a participant in the Seller MPP
on the Closing Date, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the
product of (x) the "covered compensation" under the Seller MPP earned by such
Transferred Employee from the beginning of the Seller MPP's 2008 plan year
through the Closing Date and (y) the Seller money purchase contribution
percentage equal to the Seller money purchase contribution percentage
applicable to such Transferred Employee under the Seller MPP on the Closing
Date. The aggregate amount payable with respect to Transferred Employees
pursuant to this Section 5.07(f)(iii) (the "Seller MPP Contribution") shall
be paid to Purchaser as soon as practicable (but no more than thirty days)
after the Closing Date. Each Transferred Employee's allocable share of the
Seller MPP Contribution shall be credited by Purchaser to the Transferred
Employee under the applicable tax- qualified retirement plan maintained by
Purchaser.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Seller MPP Contribution nor the
Seller PSP Contribution, nor any assets or liabilities associated therewith,
shall be reflected in the Closing Statement or be taken into account in the
calculation of the Closing Working Capital Amount.

 

 

 

(g) Seller shall retain, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and
its affiliates from and against, all liabilities pursuant to the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") and any similar state or
local statute in connection with any actions of Seller. Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its affiliates from and against all
liabilities pursuant to WARN and all similar state or local statutes in
connection with any action of Purchaser.

 

 

(h) Seller shall be responsible for all (i) severance, separation, change in
control, termination, bonus or other compensation or benefits, (ii)
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any compensation or
benefits and (iii) benefits the value of which will be calculated on the
basis of the Acquisition or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, in each case payable pursuant to
any Seller Benefit Plan and whether payable as a result of the consummation
of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise (any such entitlement, a "Severance
Benefit"); provided, however, that Purchaser (and not Seller) shall be
responsible for any Severance Benefits to which a Transferred Employee
becomes entitled following the Closing (but only to the extent such
Transferred Employee becomes entitled to such Severance Benefits as a result
of the termination of Transferred Employee's employment by Purchaser).

 

 

(i) Section 5.07(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth each Assumed
Benefit Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, from and after the Closing, Seller shall retain all liabilities
with respect to (i) all liabilities and obligations under all Seller Benefit
Plans, except, solely in the case of this clause (i), to the extent that any
such Seller Benefit Plan is an Assumed Benefit Plan that is not an Assumed
Employment Agreement, (ii) all employment and employee-benefits related
liabilities in connection with any current or former employee of Seller who
is not a Transferred Employee and (iii) all employment and employee-benefits
related liabilities in connection with any Transferred Employee that relate
to periods prior to the Closing, except, solely in the case of this clause
(iii), to the extent explicitly assumed by Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

 

(j) Purchaser and Seller shall take all actions necessary or appropriate so
that, effective as of the Closing, (i) the account balances (whether positive
or negative) (the "Transferred Account Balances") under the flexible spending
plan maintained by Seller (the "Seller Cafeteria Plan") of the Transferred
Employees who are participants in the Seller Cafeteria Plan shall be
transferred to one or more comparable plans of Purchaser (collectively, the
"Purchaser Cafeteria Plan"); (ii) the elections, contribution levels and
coverage levels of the Transferred Employees shall apply under the Purchaser
Cafeteria Plan in the same manner as under the Seller Cafeteria Plan; and
(iii) the Transferred Employees shall be reimbursed from the Purchaser
Cafeteria Plan for claims which have been (A) incurred at any time during the
plan year of the Seller Cafeteria Plan in which the Closing Date occurs and
(B) submitted to the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan from and after the Closing
Date, on the same basis and the same terms and conditions as under the Seller
Cafeteria Plan. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, and in any
event within ten business days after the amount of the Transferred Account
Balances is determined, Seller shall pay Purchaser the net aggregate amount
of the Transferred Account Balances, if such amount is positive, and
Purchaser shall pay Seller the net aggregate amount of the Transferred
Account Balances, if such amount is negative. The Seller Cafeteria Plan shall
be considered an Assumed Benefit Plan for purposes of this Agreement solely
with respect to Transferred Account Balances transferred in accordance with
this Section 5.07(j).

(k) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser shall not assume any liability or other obligation with respect to
any stock option or other award (each, an "Equity Award") granted under any
equity compensation or award program, plan or agreement of Seller or any of
its affiliates (each such plan, a "Seller Equity Plan"). With respect to any
Equity Award granted to any Transferred Employee and outstanding as of the
Closing Date under any Seller Equity Plan, Seller and its affiliates shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that each such Equity Award that is
vested as of the Closing Date shall be permitted to remain outstanding until
the earlier of (x) the twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date and (y)
the last day of the Equity Award's original term, provided that nothing in
this Section 5.07(k) shall require Seller or any of its affiliates to
take any action that would (x) result in a violation of Applicable Law or in
the imposition of the additional tax under Section 409A of the Code or (y)
be inconsistent with the terms of the applicable Seller Equity Plan.

 

 

(l) Except as otherwise may be required by Applicable Law, effective as of
the Closing Date Purchaser shall recognize, be responsible for and assume all
accrued but unpaid vacation time of the Transferred Employees, but only to
the extent such vacation time is reflected on the Closing Statement.

 

 

(m) The provisions of this Section 5.07 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the
compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to Transferred
Employees prior to or following the Transfer Time or (ii) confer upon or give
to any person, other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 5.07 under
or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 5.08. Post-Closing Cooperation. (a) Without limitation of
the agreements under Section 1.04, Purchaser, Parent and Seller shall
cooperate with each other, and shall cause their officers, employees, agents,
auditors and other Representatives to reasonably cooperate with each other,
for a period of 180 days after the Closing to ensure the orderly transition
of the Business from Seller to Purchaser and to minimize any disruption to
the Business and the other respective businesses of Parent and Purchaser that
might result from the transactions contemplated hereby. After the Closing,
upon reasonable written notice, Purchaser, Parent and Seller shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other and their employees, counsel, auditors
and other Representatives access, during normal business hours, to such
information and assistance relating to the Business (to the extent within the
control of such party) as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting and
accounting matters.

(b) Neither party shall be required by this Section 5.08 to take any action
that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or
unreasonably disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case of Purchaser, the
Business). Any information relating to the Business received by Parent,
Seller or any of their affiliates pursuant to this Section 5.08 shall be
subject to Section 5.04(b).

 

 

SECTION 5.09. Publicity. Prior to the Closing, no public release or
announcement concerning this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, the
Acquisition or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
shall be issued by any party without the prior consent of the other parties
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided, however, that any party may make any such release or announcement
that is required by Applicable Law or the rules and regulations of each stock
exchange upon which any securities of such party are listed, in which case
the party required to make such release or announcement shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, give the other parties prior notice of, and
allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on, such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance; provided, further, that each
of Seller and Purchaser may make internal announcements to their
respective employees that are consistent with the parties' prior public
disclosures regarding this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, the
Acquisition or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
after reasonable prior notice to and consultation with the other.

 

 

SECTION 5.10. Agreements Not To Compete. Each of Holdings, Parent and Seller
understands that Purchaser shall be entitled to protect and preserve the
going concern value of the Business to the extent permitted by law and that
Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement absent the provisions of
this Section 5.10. Therefore:

 

 

(a) For a period of seven years from the Closing, each of Holdings, Parent
and Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world, engage in activities or
businesses, or establish any new businesses, that are substantially in
competition with the Business ("Competitive Activities"), including (i)
selling goods or services of the type sold by the Business, except that if
any goods or services were not sold by the Business during the period of time
that it was owned by Seller and are not sold by the Business at the time
of the Closing (collectively, "Permitted Goods and Services"), each of
Holdings, Parent and Seller and their respective subsidiaries may sell any
Permitted Goods and Services notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement, (ii) soliciting any customer or prospective customer of the
Business to purchase any goods or services sold by the Business, other than
Permitted Goods and Services, from anyone other than Purchaser and its
affiliates, and (iii) assisting any person in any way to do, or attempt
to do, anything prohibited by clause (i) or (ii) above.

(b) For a period of two years from the Closing, on behalf of itself or any
other person, each of Holdings, Parent and Seller shall not, and shall cause
each of its subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, engage in (i)
soliciting or recruiting for employment, consultancy or other similar
arrangement any employees of the Business as of the date of this Agreement or
as of the Closing Date, except for general advertisements or the use of
recruiters so long as employees of the Business or persons who have worked
for the Business are not targeted, or (ii) hiring any employees of the
Business as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date, in
either case except for any individual identified on Section 5.07(a)(i) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(c) Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent Holdings, Parent or Seller
or their affiliates from (x) owning, directly or indirectly, (A) up to 5% of
any class of equity securities listed on a national securities exchange and
issued by a person engaged, directly or indirectly, in Competitive Activities
or (B) up to 5% in value of any instrument of indebtedness of a person
engaged, directly or indirectly, in Competitive Activities or (y) acquiring
and owning any person or business if less than 5% (or, if such acquisition is
consummated on or after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, if less
than 15%) of the aggregate revenues of such person or business (calculated on
a consolidated basis) during its last complete fiscal year preceding the date
of such acquisition is attributed to Competitive Activities, provided that
(i) Holdings, Parent, Seller or their affiliate, as applicable, shall use
its reasonable best efforts to dispose of the portion of such person or
business engaging in Competitive Activities within twelve months of the
consummation by Holdings, Parent, Seller or their affiliate, as applicable,
of the acquisition of such person or business and (ii) Holdings, Parent,
Seller or their affiliate, as applicable, shall (x) inform Purchaser of the
proposed sale of such competitive portion of such acquired business or, if
such portion is proposed to be sold in a transaction involving other
businesses, such transaction (any such proposed sale, a
"Proposed Divestiture") in advance of informing or commencing discussions
with any other potential acquiror or initiating any auction or other sale
process with respect to such Proposed Divestiture (it being understood that
Holdings, Parent, Seller or their affiliate, as applicable, may inform or
commence discussions with other potential acquirors or initiate any auction
or other sale process at such time thereafter that it determines) and (y)
permit Purchaser to participate in any auction or other sale process with
respect to any such sale on the same basis as all other potential acquirors.
For the avoidance of doubt, Holdings, Parent, Seller or their affiliate, as
applicable, shall be under no obligation to enter into any such transaction
with Purchaser, and shall be free in their sole discretion to make such
Proposed Divestiture to any person they select.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is understood
and agreed that the remedy of indemnity payments pursuant to Article VIII and
other remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of the
covenants contained in this Section 5.10. It is accordingly agreed that
Purchaser shall be entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Section 5.10 and to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
without proof of actual damages, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which Purchaser is entitled at law or in equity. Holdings, Parent and
Seller further agree not to assert that such a remedy, including a remedy of
specific enforcement, is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.10 shall not apply to (i) any
person (and subsidiaries thereof, other than Holdings and its subsidiaries)
that acquires control of Holdings after the date of this Agreement or (ii)
any portfolio company (other than Holdings and its subsidiaries) of any
direct or indirect stockholder of Holdings.

 

 

SECTION 5.11. Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested
by any party, each party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions (subject to Section 5.05), as
such other party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, including, in the case of Parent or Seller,
executing and delivering to Purchaser such assignments, deeds, bills of sale,
consents and other instruments as Purchaser or its counsel may reasonably
request as necessary or desirable for such purpose.

 

 

SECTION 5.12. Tax Matters. (a) (i) Within 90 days of the determination of
the Final Purchase Price, Purchaser shall provide Seller a proposed
allocation (the "Allocation") prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder of the total
consideration (including Assumed Liabilities) among the Acquired Assets. The
Allocation shall become final and binding 20 days after Purchaser provides
the Allocation to Seller, unless Seller objects in good faith. In that case,
the parties will attempt in good faith to agree upon the Allocation. If the
parties cannot agree on the Allocation, each party hereto shall use its own
allocation, as each such party shall deem appropriate.

 

 

(ii) Parent, Seller and Purchaser agree to file all Tax Returns consistent
with the final versions of the allocations and forms described in this
Section 5.12.

 

 

(b) (i) All Transfer Taxes applicable to the conveyance and transfer from
Seller to Purchaser of the Acquired Assets and any other transfer or
documentary Taxes or any filing or recording fees applicable to such
conveyance and transfer shall be paid by Seller. Each party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avail itself of any available exemptions
from any such Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with the other party in
providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain
such exemptions.

 

 

(ii) Parent, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in timely making all
filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required in connection with
Seller's payment of Transfer Taxes. Each party shall execute and deliver all
instruments and certificates reasonably necessary to enable the other to
comply with any filing requirements relating to any such Transfer Taxes.

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall each retain all Tax Returns, schedules and
work papers, records and other documents in its possession (or in the
possession of their affiliates) relating to Tax matters relevant to the
Business for each taxable period first ending after the Closing and for all

Termination, Amendment and Waiver

 

 

SECTION 7.01. Termination. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

to the Closing:

 

 

(i) by mutual written consent of Parent, Seller and Purchaser;

forth in Section 6.01(a) shall not have been satisfied or waived but all
other conditions to the parties' obligations to consummate the Acquisition

satisfied, then the Outside Date shall automatically be extended to March 4,
2009; provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.01(a)(ii)(A) shall not be available to any party if the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Outside Date is due to a

of such party's representations and warranties (or, in the case of Parent,
the representations and warranties of Seller) in this Agreement to be true;
or

(B) if any Restraint having the effects set forth in Section 6.01(b) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;

 

 

 

(iii) by Parent or Seller, if Purchaser breaches or fails to perform any of
its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the
representations or warranties of Purchaser contained herein fails to be true
and correct, which breach or failure (A) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b) and (B) is not
reasonable capable of being cured by Purchaser within 30 days after
Purchaser's receipt of written notice thereof from Parent or Seller (provided
that neither Seller nor Parent is then in breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement and no representation or warranty of
Seller or Parent contained herein then fails to be true and correct such that
the conditions set forth in Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b) could not then
be satisfied);

 

 

(iv) by Purchaser if either Parent or Seller breaches or fails to perform any
of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the
representations or warranties of Parent or Seller contained herein fails to
be true and correct, which breach or failure (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b) and
(B) is not reasonable capable of being cured by Parent or Seller, as the case
may be, within 30 days after Purchaser's receipt of written notice thereof
from Purchaser (provided that Purchaser is not then in breach of any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement and no representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained herein then fails to be true and correct such that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b) could not then be
satisfied); or

 

 

(v) by Purchaser if any Restraint having any of the effects set forth in
Section 6.02(c) shall be in effect and shall have become final and
nonappealable.

 

 

(b) In the event of termination by Parent and Seller or Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 7.01, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the
other and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
terminated, without further action by any party. If the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided herein:

confidentiality), (ii) Section 5.06 (relating to certain expenses), (iii)
Sections 3.24 and 4.06 (relating to finder's fees and broker's fees),
(iv) Section 7.01(b) and this Section 7.02 and (v) Section 5.09 (relating
to publicity). Nothing in this Section 7.02 shall be deemed to release any
party from any liability for any willful or intentional breach by such
party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to termination of
this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 7.03. Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties

Loss exceeds $15,000, in which case the entire amount of such Loss shall be
included for purposes of computing the Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder and/or applicable against the Deductible Amount (defined below),
and (B) the aggregate amount of such Losses for which indemnification would
otherwise be available exceeds $500,000 (the "Deductible Amount"), in which
event recovery by the indemnified parties shall be limited to that portion of
such Losses that exceed the Deductible Amount; provided, however, that
the limitations set forth in this clause (i) shall not apply to any claim
for indemnification to the extent arising out of an inaccuracy or breach of
any representation or warranty contained in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.05,
3.14 or 3.24 or the third sentence of Section 3.18 (to the extent such

contained in Section 3.15 or to any Loss incurred due to fraud against
Purchaser by or on behalf of Parent or Seller;

 

 

(ii) under clause (iii) of Section 8.01(a) (and to the extent relating
thereto, clause (iv) of Section 8.01(a)) for any Losses in respect of any On-
Site Environmental Liabilities unless the amount of all such Losses in the
aggregate exceeds $15,000;

 

 

(iii) under clause (i) of Section 8.01(a) (and, to the extent relating
thereto, clause (iv) of Section 8.01(a)) in excess of $25,000,000; provided,
however, that the limitation set forth in this clause (iii) shall not apply
to any claim for indemnification to the extent arising out of an inaccuracy
or breach of any Seller Specified Representation or to any Loss incurred due
to fraud against Purchaser by or on behalf of Parent or Seller; or

 

 

(iv) under clause (i) of Section 8.01(a) (and, to the extent relating
thereto, clause (iv) of Section 8.01(a)) in aggregate in excess of the Final
Purchase Price.

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

(a) inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or warranty of Purchaser

the foregoing.

 

 

SECTION 8.03. Termination of Indemnification. Except with respect to any
fraud by or on behalf of any party against the other party, such party's
obligations to

 

indemnify and hold harmless any other party pursuant to (i) Section
8.01(a)(i) (other than with respect to the Seller Specified Representations
and the representations in Section 3.15) and, to the extent relating thereto,
Section 8.01(a)(iv), shall terminate on the date that is two years after the
Closing Date and (ii) pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(iii) and, to the extent
relating thereto, Section 8.01(a)(iv), in respect of any On-Site
Environmental Liabilities related to the Alpharetta Site, shall terminate on
the date that is ten years after the Closing Date; provided, however,
that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which the applicable indemnified party shall have,
before the expiration of such period, previously made a claim by delivering a
notice of such claim pursuant to Section 8.04 to the applicable
indemnifying party. Any other obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any
party shall terminate upon the expiration of the relevant statute of
limitations, taking into account extensions thereof; provided, however, that
such obligations shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which
the applicable indemnified party has, as of the expiration of the relevant
period, taking into account extensions thereof, a pending suit against the
applicable indemnifying party.

 

 

SECTION 8.04. Procedures. (a) Third Party Claims. If a claim by a third
party is made against a party hereto or any of its affiliates (the
"indemnified party") in respect of, arising out of or involving a matter for
which the indemnified party is entitled to be indemnified by another party
hereto (the "indemnifying party") pursuant to this Article VIII (a "Third
Party Claim"), such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the Third Party Claim promptly following receipt by such
indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent (and only to the
extent) the indemnifying party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party
shall deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly following the indemnified
party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

(b) Assumption. If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense and, subject to the
seventh sentence of this Section 8.04(b), settlement thereof with counsel
selected by the indemnifying party and shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to assert any cross-claim or counterclaim in connection
therewith; provided, however, that such counsel is not reasonably objected to
by the indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred
by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If
the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it
being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the
indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the indemnifying
party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the indemnified
parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's
request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, (A) the indemnified party shall
agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that
the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in
connection with such Third Party Claim and that would not otherwise adversely
affect the indemnified party, and (B) the indemnified party shall not enter
into any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense
of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in defending such Third
Party Claim) if (i) the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other
equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the
indemnified party that the indemnified party reasonably determines, after
conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related
claim for money damages or (ii) the indemnified party reasonably believes
itself to be exposed, in the event that such Third Party Claim is not
resolved in the indemnified party or indemnifying party's favor, to Losses in
excess of amounts reasonably expected to be received from the indemnifying
party. In the case of any Third Party Claim referred to in clause (i) of the
immediately preceding sentence, if such equitable relief or other relief
portion of such Third Party Claim can be so separated from that for money
damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense
of the portion of such Third Party Claim relating to money damages.

(c) Other Claims. In the event any indemnified party should have a
claim against any indemnifying party under Section 8.01 or 8.02 that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of
such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. Subject to
Sections 8.03 and 8.05, the failure by any indemnified party so to notify
the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any
liability that it may have to such indemnified party under Section 8.01 or
8.02, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it
has been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. If the
indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party within thirty days
following its receipt of such notice that the indemnifying party disputes its
liability to the indemnified party under Section 8.01 or 8.02, such claim
specified by the indemnified party in such notice shall be conclusively
deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under Section 8.01 or 8.02 and
the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to the
indemnified party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount
of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when
the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally
determined.

 

 

SECTION 8.05. Survival of Representations and Covenants. (a) The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and in any document delivered in
connection herewith shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and
effect until the indemnification obligation therefor terminates in accordance
with Section 8.03.

 

 

(b) The obligations of Parent and Seller under Section 8.01 and the
obligations of Purchaser under Section 8.02 shall not be affected by any
knowledge by any indemnified party at or prior to the Closing of any breach
of representation or warranty, whether such knowledge came from Parent,
Seller, Purchaser or any other person, or any waiver of Section 6.02 or 6.03.

 

 

SECTION 8.06. Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. For all

SECTION 9.04. Interpretation; Exhibits and Schedules; Certain Definitions.
(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, such
reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this Agreement. Whenever the

they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation".
The words "hereof', "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The
term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent"
shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if'. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or referred to herein means
such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to a person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Unless otherwise

or more of the revenues, net income, cash flow, EBITDA or assets of the

exchangeable for, such securities) representing 10% or more of the voting
power of Seller, (iv) transaction in which any person (or the stockholders of
any person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or
the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which
beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of 10% or
more of the common stock of Seller or (v) any combination of the foregoing
(in each case, other than the Acquisition). For the avoidance of doubt, the
term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include any transaction involving the

securities of, Parent or Rockwood Specialties Group, Inc. or any person
controlling Parent or Rockwood Specialties Group, Inc., a change in control
