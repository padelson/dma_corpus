(financial or otherwise) to perform its obligations under this Agreement; and
(c) has not incurred any obligation, commitment, restriction or liability of
any kind that would impair or adversely affect such resources and
capabilities. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that: (x) the Seller, the
Company and their respective Affiliates have no responsibility for any debt
financing that the Purchaser may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (y) it is not a condition to the Closing under
this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, for the Purchaser to obtain any equity or debt financing; and
(z) it does not have the right to terminate this Agreement for failure to
obtain any equity or debt financing.

 

4.6 _Investment Intent_. The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for its own
account and not with a view to their sale or distribution in violation of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the rules and regulations thereunder, any
applicable state blue sky Laws, or any other applicable securities Laws.

 



26

    

4.7 _Qualification; Bonding_. Without limiting Section 11.5, the Purchaser is,
or as of the Closing shall be (and shall cause the Company and any applicable
Subsidiary to continue to be), qualified under applicable Laws to hold the
permits and other assets and properties of the Company and the Subsidiary. The
Purchaser has, or as of the Closing will have (and will cause the Company and
any applicable Subsidiary to have), posted such bonds and other financial
assurances, and provided such evidence of financial responsibility, as may be
required for the ownership of such permits and other assets. To Purchasers
knowledge, no fact or condition exists with respect to Purchaser in relation
to such properties and assets which would be expected to cause any
Governmental Authority to withhold its approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

4.8 _Solvency_. As of the Closing and immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the
Purchase Price and any amounts which, by the terms of this Agreement, reduce
the Purchase Price, and all of the related fees and expenses of the Purchaser
and its Affiliates in connection therewith: (i) the amount of the "fair
saleable value" of the assets of the Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiary
and the Purchasers other subsidiaries will exceed (A) the value of all
liabilities of the Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiary and the Purchasers
other subsidiaries, including contingent and other liabilities, and (B) the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of the Purchaser,
the Company, the Subsidiary and the Purchasers other subsidiaries on their
existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured; (ii) the Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiary and the
Purchasers other subsidiaries will not have an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which they are engaged or
proposed to be engaged; and (iii) the Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiary
and the Purchasers other subsidiaries will be able to pay their liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
the foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which they are engaged or proposed to
be engaged" and "able to pay their liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature" means that the Purchaser, the Company, the
Subsidiary and the Purchasers other subsidiaries will be able to generate
enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet their obligations as they become due.

4.9  _Brokers_. The Purchaser has no Liability or obligation to pay any fees
or commissions to any broker, finder, or agent in connection with the
negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement.

activities the Purchaser intends to undertake; _provided_ , _further_ , that
no Phase II environmental reviews or other intrusive environmental studies or

this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ or any other provision of this Agreement, neither
the Company nor the Subsidiary shall be required to provide to the Purchaser
documents that are subject to a confidentiality agreement that has not been
duly waived, and provided that all documents or other information subject to

reasonably be required to evidence such joint privilege. The Purchaser
agrees that it will not, and it will cause its Representatives and Affiliates
not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ for
any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. All information obtained by the Purchaser and its Representatives
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ shall be subject to the terms of the

attributable to personal injury, death, or property damage, arising out of,
or relating to, access to the assets and properties of the Company and the

respective directors, officers, employees, agents, or Representatives, even
if caused in whole or in part by the negligence (whether sole, joint, or
concurrent), strict liability, or other legal fault of the Company, the
Subsidiary, or their respective Affiliates. Purchaser recognizes and agrees
that all materials, documents, samples, reports, and other information of any
type and nature made available to it, its

documents, samples, reports, and other information. No warranty of any kind is
made by the Seller as to the information supplied to Purchaser or
its Affiliates or Representatives or with respect to the assets to which the

Seller upon reasonable notice during normal business hours. If at any time
after the Closing, the Seller requires a copy of any such book or record, the
Seller shall have the right to promptly obtain a copy thereof from
the Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiary at the Purchasers, the
Companys or the Subsidiarys cost (as applicable).

5.4  _Press Releases_. Until the Closing, neither the Seller nor the
Purchaser, nor any Affiliate thereof, shall make any press release regarding
the existence of this Agreement, the contents of this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser (in the case of announcements by the Seller or its
Affiliates) or the Seller (in the case of announcements by the Purchaser or
its Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
restrict disclosures by the Purchaser or the Seller (or any of its

(a) to the extent that such disclosures are required by, or advisable under,
applicable securities or other Laws or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange having jurisdiction over the disclosing Party or its Affiliates;

 

(b) that are necessary for a Party to perform this Agreement (including
disclosure to a Governmental Authority or any third Persons holding rights of
consent or other rights that may be applicable to the transactions

consents); or

 

(c) subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, if such Party has given the
other Party a reasonable opportunity to review such disclosure prior to its
release and no objection is raised;

_provided_ , _further_ , that, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), each Party
shall use its reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party regarding

or enter into any Contract that, if in existence on the date of this

with its terms);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and the
Subsidiary may extend or renew, on terms no less favorable in the aggregate to
the Company or the applicable Subsidiary or pursuant to the terms that are set

(viii) with respect to the Company and the Subsidiary, maintain insurance

($250,000) in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the payment

reflected in Net Working Capital as a current liability;

 

(xiii) not enter into any Contract with the Seller on the one hand and the
Company and/or a Subsidiary on the other hand;

32

    

(b) The Purchasers approval of any action restricted by this  _Section_ __ _
5.5_ shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and shall be
considered granted in full within ten (10) days (unless a shorter time is
reasonably required by the circumstances and such shorter time is specified

5.5_, in the event of an emergency, the Seller may take such actions as may be

5.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _No Participation After Closing Date_. The Seller shall take such action
as necessary to ensure that each of the Company and the Subsidiary is no
longer a participating employer eligible to participate in any of the Employee
Plans on or after the Closing Date other than an Employee Plan sponsored by
the Company or a Subsidiary solely for employees of the Company and/or
the Subsidiary. With respect to Employee Plans in which the Company or the
Subsidiary cease to be participating employers, the Seller shall take such
action as necessary to ensure that all employees of the Company and the
Subsidiary (the " _Applicable Employees_ ") cease to participate in the
Employee Plans on and after the Closing Date, except to the extent they, or
their dependents, beneficiaries or alternate payees are entitled to receive a
previously accrued benefit under an Employee Plan not transferred to the
Purchaser under this Agreement.

(b) _COBRA Benefits_. On and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser, the
Company and the Subsidiary, as applicable, shall have responsibility for all
COBRA obligations related to the Applicable Employees who are employed by the
Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, on and after the Closing Date
and their qualified beneficiaries that arise as a result of a COBRA
qualifying event occurring after the Closing Date. The Seller shall have
responsibility for all COBRA obligations for all individuals who are "MandA
qualified beneficiaries." An MandA qualified beneficiary, as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4(b), is a qualified beneficiary
for COBRA purposes whose qualifying event occurred prior to or in connection
with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and who is, or whose
qualifying event occurred in connection with, a covered employee whose last
employment prior to the qualifying event was with the Company and/or one of
the Subsidiary.

(c) _Purchaser Obligation for Employment Terms and Benefits_. 

(i) _Collective Agreements_. With respect to any Applicable Employee covered
by a collective bargaining agreement, the Purchaser shall cause each of the
Company and the Subsidiary to fulfill its respective obligations with regard
to compensation and other terms and conditions of employment set forth in the
applicable collective bargaining agreements listed on  _Schedule 3.14(a)_.

(ii) _Employment Terms_. For the twenty-four (24) month period following the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide
each Applicable Employee as of the Closing Date who remains employed by the
Company or the Subsidiary (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with the
following, for so long as such Applicable Employee remains employed by the
Company or the Subsidiary: (i) base salary or hourly wages which are no less
than the base salary or hourly wages provided thereto by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) target

 



33

    

 bonus opportunities which are no less than the target bonus opportunities
provided thereto by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary immediately prior
to the Closing; (iii) retirement and welfare benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided thereto by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing; and (iv) severance
benefits that are no less favorable than the practice, plan or policy in
effect therefor immediately prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Purchaser, the Company, or the
Subsidiary to continue the employment of any specific person.

 

(iii) _Termination_. Except as provided below, if an Applicable Employee is
terminated by the Purchaser, the Company, or the Subsidiary during the 24
month period following the Closing Date for any reason other than a
termination for cause (including any termination based on the conduct or
performance of such Applicable Employee), the Purchaser shall, or shall
cause the Company or the Subsidiary to, provide such Applicable Employee
with:

(A) severance benefits equal to the greater of the severance benefits such
Applicable Employee would be entitled to under the severance plan, policy or
agreement then applicable thereto or the following:

 

(i) as applicable, either (x) base salary for the period from the termination
date through the second anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Severance
Period_ ") based on the base salary received by such Applicable Employee as of
the termination date, or (y) wages for the Severance Period in an amount equal
to the product of (I) the hourly wage rate received by such Applicable
Employee as of the termination date, times (II) the number of hours for which
such Applicable Employee received hourly wage compensation over the twenty-
four (24) calendar month period ending with the calendar month immediately
prior to the termination date, times (III) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days in the Severance Period and the denominator of which is
730; _plus_

 

(ii) overtime for the Severance Period in an amount equal to the product of
(x) the overtime earned by the Applicable Employee during the twenty-four
(24) calendar month period ending with the calendar month immediately prior to
the termination date (adjusted to reflect such Applicable Employees base
salary or hourly wage rate as of the date of termination), times (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Severance Period
and the denominator of which is 730; _plus_

 

(iii) bonus in an amount equal to the product of (x) two times the Applicable
Employees target bonus (if any) for the year in which the termination
occurs, times (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
the Severance Period and the denominator of which is 730; and

 



34

    

(B) continued welfare benefits (including medical, prescription drug, dental,
and life insurance benefits, to the extent that such Applicable Employee
qualifies therefor) for a period equal to the longer of the Severance Period
or such period such Applicable Employee would be entitled to continued welfare
benefits under the applicable severance or other plan, policy or agreement
(or a cash payment equal to the value of such continued benefits).

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any termination of employment
resulting from any transfer of any facilities of the Company or the
Subsidiary as a result of any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding or
settlement thereof, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)(iii)_ shall
not apply; provided, however, that Purchaser and the Company shall use
good faith efforts to cause any such terminated Applicable Employee to be
hired by the authority to which such facilities are transferred (or by the
operator thereof) and, in the absence thereof, shall provide such Applicable
Employee with severance benefits equal to the severance benefits such
Applicable Employee would be entitled to under the severance plan, policy or
agreement then applicable thereto in connection with such a termination.

 

(iv) _Prior Service and Other Credits_. With respect to any employee benefit
plan, program or policy that is made available by the Purchaser, the Company
or the Subsidiary to the Applicable Employees on and after the Closing Date
(the " _Purchaser Plans_ "): (A) all periods of service with the Company, the
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate, or any predecessor entity of either, by
any such employee prior to the Closing Date shall be credited for eligibility,
participation, and vesting purposes, and to the extent required by a
collective bargaining agreement, for benefit calculation purposes, under the
Purchaser Plans, (B) with respect to any Purchaser Plans which are welfare
plans as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA to which such employee may become
eligible, the Purchaser shall cause such Purchaser Plans to provide credit
for the year in which the Closing occurs for any co-payments, deductibles,
maximum out-of-pocket payments by such employees, and to waive all pre-
existing condition exclusions and waiting periods, to the extent permitted by
the insurance carriers for Purchaser Plans without additional cost, and (C)
with respect to any Purchaser Plan to which such employee may become eligible
and which provides flexible spending accounts, the Purchaser shall cause such
Purchaser Plan to provide credit for the year in which the Closing occurs for
the employees flexible spending account balances under Sellers Plan. The
Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Subsidiary to recognize and assume
Liability for vacation days and previously accrued and reserved for by the
Company and the Subsidiary as of the Closing Date.

 

(d) _Transfer of Plan Obligations_.

 

(i) _Pension Plan_.

 

(A) _NYWSC Pension Plan_. The Company as sponsor of the New York Water Service
Corporation Pension Plan (the " _NYWSC Pension Plan_ ") for the benefit of
its employees and former employees shall continue to sponsor and maintain the
NYWSC Pension Plan following the Closing Date.

 



35

    

(B) Seller Pension Plan. On the Closing Date or within one hundred
twenty (120) days thereafter, the Seller shall cause to be transferred in
cash from the Pension Plan for Employees of American Water Works Company, Inc.
and its Designated Subsidiaries (the " _Seller s Pension Plan_") to a
defined benefit plan designated by the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser s Pension
Plan_"), that portion of assets and liabilities of the Sellers Pension Plan
attributable to the accrued benefits of those participants in
Sellers Pension Plan who are active employees or former employees of the
Company or are beneficiaries or alternate payees of such active or former
employees of the Company (referred to jointly herein as the "affected
participants"). The amount of such assets and liabilities shall be determined
in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code and Section 4044 of ERISA
(without regard to any de minimis rules) as certified by the actuaries for the
Sellers Pension Plan (following consultation with the actuaries for the
Purchasers Pension Plan) as of the date as of which the assets are
transferred. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall provide, or shall cause the Company to provide, a notice to each
affected participant regarding the cessation of benefit accruals as of the
Closing Date under the Sellers Pension Plan in accordance with Section 4980F
of the Code and the regulations thereunder and the transfer of his or her
accrued benefit to, and the continuation of accruals under, the Purchasers
Pension Plan following the Closing Date. The establishment or amendment of the
Purchasers Pension Plan and transfer of assets and Liabilities hereunder
are subject to all applicable notice requirements and required governmental
approvals, if any, including without limitation, the filing by both the
Purchaser and the Seller of Form 5310-A at least thirty (30) days prior to
the transfer. On and after the date as of which the assets are transferred,
the Seller shall not retain any further Liability with respect to any
contribution obligations or Liability for benefits under the Sellers Pension
Plan with respect to the affected participants, regardless of the funded
status of the Sellers Pension Plan or the Purchasers Pension Plan. For
purposes of clarification and not of limitation, the Sellers obligations to
the Sellers Pension Plan are limited to funding obligations due on or prior
to the Closing Date. The pension asset transfer from the Sellers Pension Plan
to the Purchasers Pension Plan based on ERISA requirements for
affected participants (as set forth in this Section 5.5(e)(i)(A)) calculated
as of the Closing Date will be adjusted to the actual transfer date by
interest based on the actual investment return of the Sellers pension plan
trust and any benefit payments made by Seller to affected participants. The
investment return will be determined using the most recently available trust
statements and using index returns for the various asset classes and the
Seller actual asset allocation at the beginning of the asset transfer month,
if necessary, for any partial month returns where statements are not readily
available.

 

(C) To effectuate such transfer, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, (i) a copy of the Purchasers Pension Plan and any amendment
necessary to effectuate the receipt of the transfer of the assets and
assumption of benefit Liabilities attributable to the accrued benefits of
participants; (ii) a copy of the trust agreement for the Purchasers Pension
Plan; (iii) the most recent favorable determination letter from the IRS with
respect to the Purchasers Pension Plan; and 

 



36

    

 (iv) an opinion from the Purchasers legal counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Seller that, to the best knowledge of the Purchaser, there is no reason to
believe that the Purchasers Pension Plan is not a qualified plan under
Section 401(a) of the Code and that the transfer of assets and assumption of
benefit Liabilities will not jeopardize the qualified status of the
Purchasers Pension Plan. The Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser as soon
as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, an opinion from the Sellers legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser that, to the best knowledge of the Seller, there is no reason to
believe that the Sellers Pension Plan is not a qualified plan under Section
401(a) of the Code and that the transfer of assets and benefit Liabilities
will not jeopardize the qualified status of the Sellers Pension Plan. The
responsibility of administration of the Purchasers Pension Plan shall be the
responsibility of the Purchaser as of the date of transfer.

 

(ii) _Disability_. The Seller shall retain liability for long-term disability
benefits payable to Applicable Employees who as of the Closing Date are
receiving long-term disability benefits or who as of the Closing Date are
eligible to receive, or following the expiration of any applicable elimination
period, will be eligible to receive long-term disability benefits. The Seller
shall be liable for payment of all sick leave, short-term disability and
workers compensation claims payable to an Applicable Employee through the
Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall be responsible thereafter. The Purchaser
agrees to honor the reemployment rights of Applicable Employees absent from
employment on the Closing Date due to sick leave, short- or long-term
disability or workers compensation.

 

(iii) _401(k) Plan_. The Seller shall retain the Savings Plan for Employees of
American Water Works Company, Inc. and its Designated Subsidiaries (the "
_Savings Plan_ "), and Applicable Employees shall be entitled to a
distribution from the Savings Plan after the Closing Date to the extent
permitted by the Savings Plan and applicable Law. The Seller, if applicable,
shall amend the Savings Plan to (i) fully vest the Applicable Employees as of
the Closing Date and (ii) allow Applicable Employees to continue to make loan
payments on any outstanding participant loan following the Closing Date. The
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to commence participation in a
Purchaser-designated 401(k) savings plan as soon as administratively
practicable following the Closing Date and shall be permitted to rollover
their account balances from the Savings Plan, including any outstanding
loans.

(iv) _Retiree Welfare Plan_.

 

(A) Retirees. The Seller shall retain all liabilities with respect to retirees
covered under its Group Insurance Plan for Retired Employees of American
Water Works Company, Inc. and its Designated Subsidiaries and Affiliates (the
"Seller Retiree Welfare Plan") on the Closing Date. The Purchaser agrees that
for a period of two years following the Closing Date the Company, the
Purchaser and any affiliate of the Purchaser shall not hire a former employee
of the Company who retired as an eligible retiree for purposes of the Seller
Retiree Welfare Plan after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing Date. In the event such retiree is hired by the Company, the
Purchaser or any affiliate of the Purchaser during such two year period
following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall pay the Seller $100,000 for
each such retiree hired.

 



37

    

(B) _Employees_. On the Closing Date or within one hundred twenty (120) days
thereafter, the Seller shall cause to be transferred in cash from the trusts
maintained pursuant to Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (the " _Seller s
VEBAs_") that apply to the Applicable Employees employed by the Company on
the Closing Date to a VEBA designated by Purchaser to fund the retiree medical
and welfare benefits of such employees (the " _Allocable VEBA Assets_ "). The
Allocable VEBA Assets shall equal the Accumulated Post-Retirement Benefit
Obligation (the " _APBO_ ") for the employees of the Company covered by a
collective bargaining agreement as a percentage of the APBO for the entire
Seller Retiree Welfare Plan multiplied by the total aggregate fair market
value of the Sellers VEBAs as of the last day of the month prior to the
Closing Date, adjusted for interest and benefit payments and contributions
through the Closing Date. The APBO for purposes of the calculation shall be
the APBO calculated as of the most recent fiscal year end. The Allocable VEBA
Assets will be calculated as of the Closing Date by actuaries for the Seller
Retiree Welfare Plan.

 

(C) Neither the foregoing nor any other provision of the Agreement is intended
to, and shall not, limit or restrict the right of any Party or any Affiliate
of any Party sponsoring a plan providing for retiree medical coverage to amend
such plan with respect to the benefits provided thereunder or to terminate
such plan except as may otherwise be required by any applicable collective
bargaining agreement.

(v) _Nonqualified Plans_. Obligations with respect to the Applicable Employees
who participate in the following nonqualified plans shall remain with the
Seller: (A) the American Water Works Company, Inc. and its Designated
Subsidiaries 2017 Nonqualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (B) the American
Water Works Company, Inc. Executive Retirement Plan, (C) the American Water
Works Company, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, (D) the Annual
Incentive Plan, and (E) the Nonqualified Savings and Deferred Compensation
Plan for Employees of American Water Works Company, Inc. and its Designated
Subsidiaries (collectively the "Nonqualified Plans"). Benefits under the
Nonqualified Plans shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the
Plans and, to the extent applicable, under the terms of any stock option
grant, restricted stock unit grant, performance stock unit grant or other
equity award or deferral agreement made to or with such employee prior to the
Closing Date.

 

(e) If a plant closing or a mass layoff occurs or is deemed to occur with
respect to the Continuing Employees at any time on or after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing all notices required under
the WARN Act, including coordinating with the Company and the Subsidiary to
ensure any required pre-Closing notices are sent and, if notices are unable
to be timely sent, payment of all amounts, penalties, liabilities, costs and
expenses.

 



38

    

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to amend any Employee Plan or affect
the Sellers, the Companys, a Subsidiarys, or any ERISA Affiliates right
to amend or terminate any Employee Plan pursuant to the terms of such plan.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to amend any Purchaser Employee Plan
or affect the Purchasers or any of the Purchasers Affiliates right to
amend or terminate any Purchaser Employee Plan pursuant to the terms of such
plan. This _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall not create any right in
any employee or any other Person to any continued employment with the Company,
the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or compensation or
benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

5.7 _Further Assurances_. After Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser each
agree to take such further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver
all such further documents as are reasonably requested by the other for
carrying out the purposes of this Agreement or of any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

5.8 _Exclusivity_. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, except for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, the Seller
shall not, and shall cause the Company, the Subsidiary, and their
respective Affiliates, not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage or
enter into any negotiation, discussion or Contract with any Person, with
respect to the sale of the Shares or any shares, capital stock or other voting
or equity interests of the Subsidiary, or all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company or the Subsidiary, or any merger, recapitalization or
similar transaction with respect to the Company or the Subsidiary.

 

5.9 _Termination of Affiliate Obligations_. Except with respect to liabilities
relating to employment relationships and the payment of compensation and
benefits in the Ordinary Course of Business, and except for the matters
described on Schedule 5.9, the Seller shall terminate, settle, cancel, or
assign effective as of or prior to the Effective Time, all
Contracts, Intercompany Debt and obligations between the Company and the
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Company and the Subsidiary), on the other hand, including the termination or
severance of Tax services, treasury and finance services, legal services and
banking services (to include the severance of any centralized clearance
accounts) (collectively, the " _Terminated Affiliate Obligations_ "). On and
after the Effective Time, none of the Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiary
or any of their Affiliates shall have any obligations or liabilities arising
out of or pursuant to any Terminated Affiliate Obligations.

 

5.10 _Confidentiality_.

(a) For five (5) years after the Closing Date, the Seller shall (and shall
cause its Affiliates to) maintain as confidential, and shall not (and shall
cause its Affiliates to not) use or disclose, except as required by Law or as
authorized in writing by the Purchaser, any Confidential Information. The
Seller shall take all appropriate steps (and to cause each of its Affiliates
to take all appropriate steps) to safeguard such Confidential Information and
to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft, using
the standard of care that they each use to protect

 



39

    

 their own similar confidential information (and in no event less than a
reasonable standard of care). In the event the Seller or any of its Affiliates
is required by Law to disclose any Confidential Information, the Seller shall
promptly notify the Purchaser in writing, which notification shall include the
nature of the legal requirement and the extent of the required disclosure. The
foregoing shall not apply to press releases or other announcements pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ or Confidential Information that: (i) is or becomes
generally available to the public, other than as a result of breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10(a)_ by the Seller; (ii) is acquired independently from a
third Person that represents to the Seller or its Affiliate that it has, and
Seller or such Affiliate does not otherwise have reason to believe that such
Person does not have, the right to disseminate such information at the time
it is acquired by the Seller; or (iii) is used or disclosed by the Seller in
the enforcement of this Agreement or its rights under this Agreement or under
any document executed pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect
as of the Closing.

 

(b) The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach,
or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_
will be inadequate and, accordingly, the Seller covenants and agrees that the
Purchaser shall, in addition to any other rights and remedies which the
Purchaser may have at Law, be entitled to equitable relief, including
injunctive relief, and to the remedy of specific performance with respect to
any breach or threatened breach of such covenant, as may be available from any
court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, the Seller and the Purchaser
agree that the terms of the covenant in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10 _are fair
and reasonable and are necessary to accomplish the full transfer of the
goodwill and other intangible assets contemplated hereby. In the event that
any of the covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall be
determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever, then any such provision or provisions shall not be deemed
void, and the Parties hereto agree that said limits may be modified by the
court and that said covenant contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall be
amended in accordance with said modification, it being specifically agreed by
the Parties that it is their continuing desire that this covenant be enforced
to the full extent of its terms and conditions or if a court finds the scope
of the covenant unenforceable, the court should redefine the covenant so as to
comply with applicable Law. 

5.11 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser, the Company and the
Subsidiary (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying Person_") shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
Closing Date, an officer, director, employee, shareholder, equity holder,
member or manager of the Company or its Subsidiary (collectively, the "
_Company Indemnified Agents_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with
the approval of the DandO Indemnifying Person (which approval shall not
be unreasonably delayed, conditioned, or withheld) of or in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part
on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Person is or was a
director, officer, employee, shareholder, equity holder, member or manager of
any of the Company or its Subsidiary and arising out of actions or omissions
of the Company, its Subsidiary, or any officer, director, employee thereof
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at, or after, the Closing Date, but only to the extent the Company
or its Subsidiary would be required to do so as of the date of this Agreement
under the governing documents of the 

 



40

    

 Company or such Subsidiary; _provided_ , that each DandO Indemnifying Person
shall only be required to indemnify a Company Indemnified Agent pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ to the extent permitted under the Law of the
state of its formation to indemnify directors, officers, managers,
shareholders, equityholders, members and employees, as the case may be, or
those of a direct or indirect subsidiary (and the Purchaser, the Company and
its Subsidiary, as the case may be, will pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Company Indemnified Agent
to the fullest extent permitted by Law). In addition, the governing documents
of the Company, its Subsidiary and their successors and assigns shall post-
Closing contain provisions with respect to indemnification no less favorable
to the Company Indemnified Agents than those in effect in the governing
documents of the Company and its Subsidiary with respect to current officers,
directors, managers, shareholders, equityholders, members and employees as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) Each Company Indemnified Agent under this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ will,
promptly after the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action or
other proceeding against such Company Indemnified Agent in respect of which
indemnity may be sought from a DandO Indemnifying Person under this _Section_ __
_ 5.11_, notify the DandO Indemnifying Person in writing of the commencement
thereof. The omission of any Company Indemnified Agent to notify a DandO
Indemnifying Person of any such action shall not relieve such DandO Indemnifying
Person from any liability which it may have to such Company Indemnified
Agent, unless, and only to the extent that, such omission actually and
materially prejudices the DandO Indemnifying Person. In case any such action or
other proceeding shall be brought against any Company Indemnified Agent
and it shall notify the DandO Indemnifying Person of the commencement thereof,
the DandO Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate therein and, to
the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Company Indemnified Agent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Company Indemnified Agent may, at its own expense, retain
separate counsel to participate in such defense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in any action or proceeding in which both the DandO Indemnifying
Person and a Company Indemnified Agent are, or are reasonably likely to
become, a party, such Company Indemnified Agent shall have the right to employ
separate counsel at the DandO Indemnifying Persons expense and to control its
own defense of such action or proceeding if, based on the advice of counsel to
such Company Indemnified Agent, (a) there are or may be legal defenses
available to such Company Indemnified Agent or to other Company Indemnified
Agents that are different from or additional to those available to the DandO
Indemnifying Person or (b) any conflict or potential conflict exists between
the DandO Indemnifying Person and such Company Indemnified Agent that would
make such separate representation advisable. The DandO Indemnifying Person shall
not, without the consent of the Company Indemnified Agent, consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Company Indemnified Agent of a release from all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation or which requires action by the Company Indemnified Agent.
The rights accorded to Company Indemnified Agents under this Agreement shall
be in addition to any rights that any Company Indemnified Agent may have at
common law, by separate agreement or otherwise.

 

(c) For six (6) years from the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiary to maintain "tail" officers and directors
liability insurance covering the Persons who are presently covered by their
officers and directors liability insurance policies (copies of which have
been made available to the Purchaser) with respect to actions and omissions

 



41

    

 occurring prior to the Closing Date, providing coverage from insurance
carriers with the same or better credit ratings as the Companys and its
Subsidiarys current insurance carrier with respect to officers and
directors liability insurance and fiduciary duty insurance and not less
favorable than provided by such insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement. The Purchaser shall pay, or cause the Company and its Subsidiary
to pay, any applicable premiums for such insurance.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Agent, his
or her heirs and his or her Representatives.

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that none of the Seller, the Company

predictions and information so furnished; that the Purchaser shall not have
any claims against the Seller, the Company, the Subsidiary or their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, including any investment banker or broker, with
respect thereto; and that the Purchaser has not relied thereon. The Purchaser
acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article 3_ , no Person has been authorized by the Seller, the Company or the
Subsidiary to make any representation or warranty regarding the Seller, the
Company or the Subsidiary, any of their respective businesses or assets, the
Shares or the transactions contemplated hereby and, if made, such
representation or warranty may not be relied upon as having been authorized by
the Seller, the Company or the Subsidiary.

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it: (i) has made its own

and warranties set forth in _Article 3_ , has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the Company and the Subsidiary, their businesses and the Shares;
and (ii) has conducted such investigations of the Company and the Subsidiary,
their businesses and the Shares as the Purchaser deems necessary to satisfy
itself as to the operations and conditions thereof, and will rely solely on
such investigations and inquiries, the 

 



42

    

 representations and warranties set forth in _Article 3_ , and the
certificate to be delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.2(c)_. The Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that it will not at
any time assert any claim against the Seller, the Company, the Subsidiary or
any of their respective present and former Affiliates or Representatives,
including any investment banker or broker, or attempt to hold any of such
Persons liable, for any inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect
to the information furnished by such Persons concerning the Seller, the
Company or the Subsidiary, any of their respective businesses or assets or
the Shares, other than for any inaccuracies or misstatements in the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article 3_ (subject to the
limitations and expiration set forth in _Article 10_ ) or in the certificate
to be delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_.

(c) The Purchaser is (or its advisors are) experienced and knowledgeable in
the business of storing, supplying, distributing, and selling potable and
irrigation water to the public, wholesale water transmission, wastewater
treatment, and related services and activities and is aware of the risks of
that business. The Purchaser acknowledges and affirms that: (a) it has been
given such access to the Business, been afforded the opportunity to ask all
questions of the Seller, and completed such independent investigation,
verification, reviews, analysis, and evaluation of the Company, the
Subsidiary, and the Business, as it has deemed necessary or appropriate to
enter into this Agreement; and (b) prior to the Closing, it will have
completed its independent investigation, verification, analysis,
and evaluation of the Company, the Subsidiary, and the Business and made all
such reviews and inspections of Company, the Subsidiary, and the Business as
it deems necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Except for the representations and warranties expressly made by
Sellers in _Article 3_ of this Agreement or the certificate to be delivered to
the Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_, the Purchaser acknowledges
that there are no representations or warranties, express or implied, as to
the financial condition, liabilities, operations, business, or prospects of
the Company, the Subsidiary, and the Business and that, in making its decision
to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Purchaser has relied solely upon its own independent
investigation, verification, analysis, and evaluation. The Purchaser
understands and acknowledges that neither the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission nor any federal, state, or foreign agency has passed
upon the Shares, the Company, the Subsidiary, or the Business or made any
finding or determination as to the fairness of an investment in any of the
foregoing or the accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures made to the
Purchaser, and, except as set forth in _Article 9_ , the Purchaser is not
entitled to cancel, terminate, or revoke this Agreement. Except with respect
to Sellers Fundamental Representations, at Closing, the Purchaser shall be
deemed to have actual knowledge of all facts contained in such materials,
documents, and other information as have been delivered to Purchaser prior to
the Closing, and of any omission or absence of facts from such materials,
documents, and other information which would have been discovered by the
Purchasers exercise of reasonable care and due diligence.

 

(d) The Purchaser acknowledges that the Purchase Price has been negotiated
based upon the Purchasers express agreement that should the Closing occur,
the Purchaser will acquire the Company and the Subsidiary and their
businesses, properties, assets and liabilities in an "as is" condition and on
a "where is" basis, without any representation or warranty of any kind,
express or implied, except such representations and warranties set forth in
_Article 3_ and the certificate to be delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_. Further, without limiting
any representation or warranty set forth in _Article 3_ , the Purchaser
acknowledges

 



43

    

 that it has waived and hereby waives as a condition to the Closing or
otherwise any further due diligence reviews, inspections or examinations with
respect to the Company, the Subsidiary and the Shares, including with respect
to engineering, environmental, title, survey, financial, operational,
regulatory and legal compliance matters, other than as provided in Section 5.2
hereof to verify the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement (which shall not be a condition to the Closing,
except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_).

 

5.13 _Release of Support Obligations_.

 

(a) The Purchaser recognizes that the Seller and its Affiliates have provided
guarantees or other credit support to the Company and/or the Subsidiary, all
of which that are outstanding as of this Agreement are set forth on _Schedule
5.13_ (such support obligations set forth on _Schedule 5.13_ , as modified or
replaced from time to time in the Ordinary Course of Business,
are hereinafter referred to as " _Support Obligations_ ").

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate, and
each shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, effect the full and
unconditional release, effective as of the Closing Date, of the Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company or the Subsidiary) from all
Support Obligations, and in the case of the Purchaser, by (among other
things):

(i) furnishing a letter of credit to replace each existing letter of credit

existing letter of credit;

(ii) instituting an escrow arrangement to replace each existing escrow
arrangement that is a Support Obligation with terms reasonably acceptable to
the counterparty of such existing escrow arrangement;

(iv) posting a surety or performance bond to replace each existing surety or
performance bond that is a Support Obligation, which replacement surety or
performance bond is issued by a Person having a net worth and credit rating at
least equal to those of the issuer of such existing surety or performance
bond, and containing terms and conditions that are substantially similar to
the terms and conditions of such existing surety or performance bond; and/or

(v) replacing any other security agreement or arrangement on substantially
similar terms and conditions to the existing security agreement or arrangement

44

    

(c) The Purchaser shall cause the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such Support

the Seller, one of its Affiliates or the Seller Designee each original copy of
each original guaranty, letter of credit or other instrument constituting or

(d) If the Purchaser and the Seller are not successful, following the use
of commercially reasonable efforts, in obtaining the complete and
unconditional release of the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company
and the Subsidiary) from any Support Obligations by the Closing Date (each
such unreleased Support Obligation, until such time as such Support
Obligation is released in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.13(d)(i)_, a "
_Continuing Support Obligation_ "), then:

 

(i) from and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Seller shall
continue to cooperate, and each shall continue to use its commercially
reasonable efforts, to obtain promptly the full and unconditional release of
the Seller and its Affiliates from each Continuing Support Obligation;

 

(ii) the Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates from and
against any liabilities, losses and reasonable costs or expenses incurred by
the Seller and its Affiliates from and after the Closing Date in connection
with each Continuing Support Obligation (including any demand or draw upon, or
withdrawal from, any Continuing Support Obligation); and

 

(iii) the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates, including in
all events the Company and the Subsidiary, not to, effect any amendments or
modifications or any other changes to the Contracts or obligations to which
any of the Continuing Support Obligations relate, or to otherwise take any
action that could increase, extend or accelerate the Liability of the Seller
or any of its Affiliates under any Continuing Support Obligation, without the
Sellers prior written consent, which, subject to the application of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(d)_ to any such increase, extension
or acceleration, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

5.14 _Transition Team_.

 

(a) Within fifteen (15) days following the date of this Agreement, the Seller
shall deliver to the Purchaser a list of Representatives to be appointed to a
joint transition team. The Purchaser will appoint its Representatives to such
team within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Sellers list. Such joint
transition team will be responsible for preparing, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and timely implementing, a
transition plan that will identify and describe substantially all of the
various transition activities that the Parties will cause to occur before the
Closing, specifically including the extraction of the Data from the Sellers
systems. In addition, the Seller shall keep the joint transition team updated
on material matters relating to the operation of the Business.

 



45

    

(b) In addition to and in no way limiting _Section_ __ _ 5.14(a)_, the
Parties shall, as promptly as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, agree to the scope and duration of the services to be provided by
the Seller and/or its Affiliates to the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates
necessary to ensure a consistent level of services to the customers of the
Business following Closing, which services shall be provided at reasonable
rates (which rates shall not exceed 100% of the Sellers, or its Affiliates,
cost of providing such services) as allocated in accordance with the
methodologies used for such allocations by the Seller and its Affiliates in
accordance with past practice, and in accordance with the terms and conditions
to be set forth in a Transition Services Agreement (such agreement, the "

(a) From and after Closing, the Seller shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify, and hold harmless the Purchaser, the Company, and their respective
Affiliates from and against all Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiary for any
Pre-Closing Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall be liable
only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, reserved for
such Taxes (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) and taken into account in

adjustments set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.3_.

(c) Whenever it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to determine the
portion of any Taxes for a Straddle Period which is allocable to the Pre-
Closing Period or the Post-Closing Period, any Taxes attributable to the
Straddle Period that are based on or related to income, gains, or receipts
will be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period
based on an interim closing of the books (such Taxes allocable to the Pre-
Closing Period being determined as if such taxable period ended as of the end
of the Closing Date) and any other Taxes will be prorated between the Pre-
Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period based upon the number of days in
the applicable period ending on and including the Closing Date and the number
of days in the portion of the Straddle Period beginning on and including the
day after the Closing Date.

 

8.2 _Preparation and Filing of Company Tax Returns_.

Straddle Period shall be submitted (with copies of any relevant schedules,
work papers and other documentation then available) to the Seller for the
Sellers written approval not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the due
date for the filing of such Tax Return, which written approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. If the Seller objects to a
Straddle Period Tax Return, the Purchaser and the Seller shall endeavor to
resolve the matter. If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to agree as to
the Straddle Period Tax Return, the matter will be referred to the Accounting
Arbitrator, whose decision shall be binding.

 

8.3 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) From and after Closing, the Seller shall grant to the Purchaser (or its
designees) reasonable access at all reasonable times to the information,
books, and records relating to the Company or the Subsidiary within the
possession of the Seller (including work papers and correspondence with taxing
authorities, but excluding work product of and attorney-client communications
with the Sellers legal counsel and personnel files), and shall afford the
Purchaser (or its designees) the right (at the Purchasers expense) to take
extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit the Purchaser (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns,
to conduct negotiations with Tax authorities, and to implement the provisions
of, or to investigate or defend any claims between the Parties arising under,
this Agreement.

 

(b) From and after Closing, the Purchaser shall grant to the Seller (or the
Sellers designees) reasonable access at all reasonable times to the
information, books, and records relating to the Company and the Subsidiary

(including work papers and correspondence with taxing authorities, but
excluding work product of and attorney-client communications with any of the
Purchasers legal counsel and personnel files), and shall afford the Seller
(or the Sellers designees) the right (at the Sellers expense) to take
extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit the Seller (or the Sellers designees) to prepare Tax
Returns, to conduct negotiations with, or contest deficiencies asserted by,
Tax authorities, and to implement the provisions of, or to investigate or
defend any claims between the Parties arising under, this Agreement.

(c) Each of the Parties shall preserve and retain all schedules, work papers,
and other documents within such Partys possession relating to any Tax Returns
of, or with respect to, Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiary or to any
claims, audits or other proceedings affecting the Company or the Subsidiary
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (including extensions)
applicable to the taxable period to which such documents relate or until the
final determination of any controversy with respect to such taxable period,
and until the final determination of any payments that may be required with
respect to such taxable period under this Agreement.

(d) At either the Purchasers or the Sellers request, the other Party shall
provide reasonable access to the Purchasers or the Sellers, as the case may
be, and their respective Affiliates (including the Companys and
the Subsidiary) personnel who have knowledge of the information described in
this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_.

 



52

    

(e) In the case of any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of
this  _Article 8_ , if the Party that is not preparing the Tax Return (or any
of its Affiliates) is required to pay any Taxes shown on the Tax Return, then
the Party preparing the Tax Return shall provide the Party not preparing the
Tax Return with appropriate documentation and computations reasonably
requested by such latter Party supporting the determinations made by the Party
preparing the Tax Return as to the amount of Tax so due by the Party not
preparing the Tax Return (or any of its Affiliates).

8.4 _Contest Provisions_. If, after the Closing, the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates receive notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or
assessments or other disputes, assessments or proceedings concerning Taxes
with respect to which the Seller may incur indemnification liability under
this Agreement (a " _Tax Proceeding_ "), the Purchaser shall promptly notify
the Seller of the Tax Proceeding in writing and in any event within ten (10)
days after receiving the notice of the Tax Proceeding. The Seller shall have
the right to represent their interests in any Tax Proceeding and to
employ counsel of their choice at their expense. The Purchaser shall have the
right to participate in any such Tax Proceeding at its own expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall not be entitled to settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, that portion
of a Tax Proceeding for which the Purchaser may incur an indemnification
obligation or that would result in increased liability for the Purchaser for
Taxes attributable to a Post-Closing Period without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

8.5 _Post-Closing Actions Which Affect the Seller_ __ _s Tax Liability_.

(a) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ with respect to Section
338(h)(10) Elections, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit its
Affiliates to, take any action on or after the Closing Date that could (i)
increase the Sellers liability for Taxes (including any liability of the
Seller to indemnify the Purchaser for Taxes under this Agreement) or (ii)
result in, or change the character of, any income or gain that the Seller must
report on any Tax Return.

 

(b) Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall amend,
refile, or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to
the Company or the Subsidiary with respect to any taxable year or period
ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period without the prior
written consent of the Seller, which consent may be withheld in the sole
discretion of either Seller.

8.6 _Refunds_.

 

(a) Any refunds of Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Period shall be for
the account of the Seller and shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller
within five (5) days of receipt of any such refund except to the extent that
such Tax refund was taken into account for purposes of calculating the Final
Purchase Price after giving effect to all adjustments set forth in _Section_
__ _ 2.4_. In determining the portion of a Tax refund relating to a Pre-
Closing Period, any refund of Taxes relating to a Straddle Period shall be
equitably apportioned between the portion of such period ending on the
Closing Date and the portion of such taxable period beginning on the day after
the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller and
their Affiliates at the Sellers expense in order to take all necessary steps
to claim any such refund. The Purchaser shall

 



53

    

 notify the Seller within ten (10) days following the discovery of a right to
claim any such refund and upon receipt of any such refund. The Purchaser
agrees to claim any such refund as soon as possible after the discovery of a
right to claim a refund and to furnish to the Seller all information, records
and assistance necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment at
the Sellers expense.

 

(b) The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiary
not to, carry back any Tax Item of the Company or the Subsidiary arising in
any taxable period beginning at or after the Closing Date to a taxable year
ending before the Closing Date, except as required by applicable Law.

 

8.7 _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election_.

 

(a) At Purchasers election, Purchaser and the Seller shall jointly make (i)
the joint election provided for in Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and
Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (the " _Section_ __ _ 338
Regulations_") with respect to the Company and/or (ii) such other similar
elections, if any, under the legal requirements of any state or local
jurisdiction analogous to the election provided for in Section 338 of the Code
(the elections described in (i) and (ii) collectively, the " _Section_ __ _
338 Elections_"). Purchaser and the Seller shall comply fully with all filing
and other requirements necessary to effectuate the Section 338 Elections on a
timely basis and agree to cooperate in good faith with each other in the
preparation and timely filing of any Tax Returns required to be filed in
connection with the making of the Section 338 Elections, including the
exchange of information and the joint preparation and filing of IRS Forms
8023 and IRS Forms 8883 (and all supplements thereto).

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Finalization Date, the Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller, using and based upon the best information
available to the Purchaser, a schedule (the " _Section_ __ _ 338 Allocation
Schedule_") allocating the Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs)
among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code,
the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provisions of state,
local or non-U.S. Law, as appropriate), for the Sellers review, comment, and
approval, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The Seller shall have thirty (30) days to approve or object to the
Section 338 Allocation Schedule. If the Seller objects to an allocation on
the Section 338 Allocation Schedule in writing, the Purchaser and the Seller
shall endeavor to resolve the matter. If the Purchaser and the Seller are
unable to agree as to such an allocation, the matter will be referred to the
Accounting Arbitrator, whose decision shall be binding. Upon final agreement
as to the allocation, the allocation shall be binding upon the Purchaser and
the Seller.

 

(c) Each of Purchaser and the Seller agrees to (i) prepare and timely file all
applicable Tax Returns, including IRS Forms 8023 and IRS Forms 8883 (and all
supplements thereto), in accordance with the Section 338 Allocation Schedule.
At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to Purchaser executed IRS Forms 8023,
which Purchaser may, at its option, file with the IRS. The Seller shall
include any income, gain, loss deduction, or other Tax Item resulting from the
Section 338 Elections on its Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable
law.

 



54

    

(d) Purchaser and the Seller agree to act in accordance with the Section 338
Allocation Schedule in the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns and in
the course of any Tax audit, appeal, or litigation relating thereto, except as
may be required by applicable law. Upon payment of any indemnification
obligations hereunder resulting in an adjustment of the "aggregate deemed
sale price," the Section 338 Allocation Schedule shall be appropriately
adjusted.

 

(e) Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge that, if the Section 338(h)(10)
election is made, the acquisition of the Purchased Shares will be properly
viewed for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (a) with regard to Purchaser as
though Purchaser acquired all of the assets of the Company from the Company
for the consideration provided herein, and (b) with regard to the Seller
and the Company as though the Company sold its assets to Purchaser in
exchange for the consideration provided herein and liquidated on the Closing
Date. Purchaser and Seller agree to act in a manner consistent with such
treatment for federal income Tax purposes and not to voluntarily take any
position inconsistent therewith in the course of any Tax audit or other
proceeding unless required to do so by applicable Laws.

of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ not to be satisfied), upon written
notice to the Seller, if there has been a material violation, breach or
inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Seller or the Company contained in this Agreement, which violation, breach or
inaccuracy would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ not to
be satisfied, and such violation, breach or inaccuracy has not been waived by
the Purchaser or cured by the Seller, as applicable, within twenty (20)
Business Days after receipt by the Seller of written notice thereof from the
Purchaser or is not reasonably capable of being cured prior to the Closing End
Date; or

(e) by the Seller (if it is not in material breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement so as to cause any
of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ not to be satisfied), upon written
notice to the Purchaser, if there has been a material violation, breach or
inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement, which violation, breach or inaccuracy
would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ not to be
satisfied, and such violation, breach or inaccuracy has not been waived by
the Seller or cured by the Purchaser, as applicable, within twenty (20)
Business Days after receipt by the Purchaser of written notice thereof from

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force
or effect (except for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, this _Article 9_
, _Article 11_ , and the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which shall
continue in full force and effect). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the termination of this Agreement under _Section_ __ _
9.1_ shall not relieve any Party from liability or damages (which the Parties
acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs, and may include, to the extent proven, the benefit of
the bargain lost by a Partys equityholders (taking into consideration
relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value
of money)) for willful breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement prior to termination.

ARTICLE 10

 

INDEMNIFICATION; LIMITATIONS

 

10.1 _No Survival; Exclusive Remedy; Representations and Warranties Insurance
Policy_. Except in the case of Fraud or as otherwise provided in Section
10.3:

(a) All representations and warranties of any Party hereunder and any
certificate related to any such representations and warranties shall
terminate upon, and shall not survive, the Closing, and none of the Parties
nor any of their Affiliates, nor any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, equityholders, partners, members, managers, trustees,
beneficiaries or Representatives shall have any liability whatsoever with
respect to any such representations and warranties and no claim for breach of
any such representation or warranty or any claim for detrimental reliance or
other right or remedy based thereon (whether in contract, in tort or at law
or in equity) may be brought after Closing with respect thereto against any
Party nor any Affiliate thereof, or any director, officer, employee, equity
holder, partner, member, manager, trustee, beneficiary or representative of
any Party or any Affiliate thereof.

(b) The Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy is the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Purchaser for any breach of (i) the representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement or (ii) the certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_ caused by any breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement.

 



56

    

(c) The Parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement, or to
any further indemnification rights or other claims of any nature whatsoever
in respect thereof (whether by contract, common law, statute, law, regulation
or otherwise, including under the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt
Organizations Act of 1970), all of which the Parties hereby waive. In
furtherance of the foregoing, from and after Closing, each Party hereby waives
and releases to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each other
Party and each of their respective Non-Recourse Parties, whether in any
individual, corporate or any other capacity, from and against any and all
other rights, claims and causes of action it may have against such other Party
or any of their respective Non-Recourse Parties relating (directly or
indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement (including relating to any exhibit, Schedule
or document delivered under this Agreement), including whether arising under
or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, Law or ordinance
or otherwise, including any rights, claims or causes of action with respect to
any environmental, health or safety matters.

10.2 _Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy_. No failure of
Purchaser to obtain the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy, and
no cancellation, termination, amendment, waiver or other modification of the
Representation and Warranties Insurance Policy, shall in any way increase any
rights of Purchaser, increase any obligations of Seller, or modify or affect
in any way any limitations set forth in this Agreement or arising in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. If the Purchaser obtains
the Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy, such Representations and
Warranties Insurance Policy shall contain a complete waiver of the right to
subrogation against the Seller and its Affiliates and neither the Purchaser
nor its Affiliates shall amend the Representations and Warranties
Insurance Policy in any manner that effects such waiver without the prior
written consent of the Seller, which consent may be withheld at its sole and
absolute discretion.

 

10.3 _Indemnification for Fundamental Representations and Covenants_.
Notwithstanding Section 10.1:

 

(a) All Seller Fundamental Representations and any certificate delivered by
Seller to Purchaser hereunder to the extent relating thereto, all Purchaser
Fundamental Representations and any certificate delivered by Purchaser to
Seller hereunder to the extent relating thereto, and all covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing; _provided_
,  _however_ , that no Person may make or bring a claim after the date that
is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date with respect to any covenant
or agreement that by its terms is to be performed prior to or at Closing.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiary) (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from
and against all losses incurred or suffered by any Purchaser Indemnified Party
resulting from:

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_, _Section_ __
_ 3.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _
3.4_, _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ or  _Section_ __ _ 3.17_ of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Seller Fundamental Representations_ ") or, to the extent
relating to any of the foregoing, any certificate delivered to the Purchaser
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_;

 



57

    

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement that by its terms is to be performed prior to or at Closing; or

(iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement.

(c) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Company and its Subsidiary)
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all
losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party resulting from:

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Purchaser
contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.1_,  _Section_ __ _ 4.2_, _Section_ __ _
4.8_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.9_ of this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Fundamental Representations_ ") or, to the extent relating to
any of the foregoing, any certificate delivered to the Seller pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_; or

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement.

11.3 _Sales or Use Tax, Recording Fees and Similar Taxes and Fees_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Article 8_ , the Purchaser shall
bear any sales, use, excise, real property transfer or gain, gross receipts,
goods and services, registration, capital, documentary, stamp or transfer
Taxes, recording fees, and similar Taxes and fees incurred and imposed upon,
or with respect to, the property transfers or other transactions contemplated
hereby (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). Should the Seller, the Company, or any
Affiliate of any of them pay prior to Closing, or should the Seller or any
continuing Affiliate of the Seller pay after Closing, any amount for which the
Purchaser is liable under this _Section_ __ _ 11.3_, the Purchaser shall,
promptly following receipt of the Sellers invoice, describing the amount in
reasonable detail, reimburse the amount paid. If such transfers are exempt
from any such Taxes or fees upon the filing of an appropriate certificate or
other evidence of exemption, the Purchaser shall timely furnish to Seller
such certificate or evidence.

11.4 _Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, all expenses
incurred by the Seller in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation or execution of this Agreement, and the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to the Closing, including
all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, and financial advisers
employed by the Seller, shall be borne solely and entirely by the Seller, and
all such expenses incurred by the Purchaser shall be borne solely and entirely
by the Purchaser.

 

11.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the legal relations between the
Parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of Laws that
would direct the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

11.6 _Dispute Resolution_. Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction in any
action brought in the United States federal courts located in the State of
Delaware with respect to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of, in
relation to, or in connection with, this Agreement, and each of the Parties
agrees that any action instituted by it against the other with respect to
any such dispute, controversy, or claim (except to the extent a dispute,
controversy, or claim arising out of, in relation to, or in connection with,
the determination of the Estimated Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.4_ that is referred to the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to that Section)
will be instituted exclusively in such courts. Each Party: (a) irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts; (b) waives any objection
to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in such courts; (c) waives
any objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have
jurisdiction over it; and (d) agrees that service of process upon it may be
effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered mail (or any substantially
similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to it at its address specified in
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may commence any
lawsuit in a court other than the above named courts solely for the purpose
of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above named courts. The
foregoing consents to jurisdiction and service of process shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in any other U.S. state for any
purpose except as provided in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to confer
any rights on any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement. The Parties
hereby waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought
by any Party against another in any matter whatsoever arising out of, in
relation to, or in connection with, this Agreement.

 

11.7 _Captions_. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and
shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

 



60

    

11.8 _Waivers_. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements, or conditions in this Agreement contained may be
waived by the Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by
the Party to whom compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but
not in any other manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of,
or consent to a change in, other provisions of this Agreement (whether or not
similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

11.9 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign (including by change of control,
merger, consolidation, or stock purchase) or otherwise transfer all or any
part of this Agreement to any third Person, nor shall any Party delegate any
of its rights or duties under this Agreement (including by change of control,
merger, consolidation, or stock purchase) to any third Person, without the
prior written consent of the other Party and any transfer or delegation made
without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall have the right, without such consent, to assign its rights
under this Agreement to a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Purchaser, so long as such assignment is consistent with any applications
filed with any applicable PUC prior thereto for approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no such assignment shall release
Purchaser from, and Purchaser shall remain primarily liable for, any and all
obligations and liabilities hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

11.10 _Entire Agreement_. The Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement, the
Purchaser Guarantee, and the documents to be executed under this Agreement
and the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and
discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties pertaining to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

11.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing signed by the Seller and the Purchaser and expressly
identified as an amendment or modification.

 

11.12 _No Third-Person Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle
any Person other than the Purchaser and the Seller to any claim, cause of
action, remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly provided to
the Company Indemnified Agents pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_, and Holland and Knight pursuant to _Section_ __ _
11.18_.

11.13  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or any application
thereof, is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any
Law, this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to conform, in
each case consistent with the intention of the Parties, to such Law, and, to
the extent such provision cannot be so reformed, then such provision (or the
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable application thereof) shall be deemed
deleted from (or prohibited under) this Agreement, as the case may be, and
the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions
contained in this Agreement (and any other application of such provision)
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

 



61

    

11.14 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the
date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action
is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to
be given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day),
then the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the
expiration of such period during which notice is required to be given or
action taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day.

 

11.15 _References_. In this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise:
(a) references to any gender includes a reference to all other genders; (b)
references to the singular includes the plural, and vice versa; (c) reference
to any Article or Section means an Article or Section of this Agreement; (d)
reference to any Exhibit or Schedule means an Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement, all of which are incorporated into, and made a part of, this
Agreement; (e) unless expressly provided to the contrary, "hereunder",
"hereof", "herein", and words of similar import are references to this
Agreement as a whole and not any particular Section or other provision of this
Agreement; (f) references to "$" or "Dollars" means United States Dollars; (g)
"include" and "including" mean include or including without limiting the
generality of the description preceding such term; (h) "made available" means
that the Purchaser, its Affiliates, or Representatives have had the
opportunity, prior to the date of this Agreement, to review the relevant
documents or referenced matters or materials at the offices of the Seller or
its Affiliates or Representatives or electronically; and (i) the word "or"
shall not be exclusive. Inclusion of a matter on a Schedule attached hereto
with respect to a representation or warranty that addresses matters having a
Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed an indication that such matter
does, or may, have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedules may include matters
not required by the terms of the Agreement to be listed on the Schedule, which
additional matters are disclosed for purposes of information only, and
inclusion of any such matter does not mean that all such matters
are included. A matter set forth on a Schedule as an exception for any
representation shall be deemed to be an exception to all other representations
for which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face.

 

11.16 _Construction_. The Purchaser is capable of making such investigation,
inspection, review and evaluation of the Shares, the Company, the Subsidiary,
and the Business as a prudent purchaser would deem appropriate under the
circumstances, including with respect to all matters relating to the Business,
its value, operation, and suitability. The Seller and the Purchaser have had
the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the
negotiation of the details of the transaction contemplated hereby. This
Agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations from equal bargaining
positions. It is expressly agreed that this Agreement shall not be construed
against any Party, and no consideration shall be given or presumption made, on
the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision of
this Agreement.

11.17 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of
any breach or threatened breach by the Seller, on the one hand, or the
Purchaser, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, the

 



62

    

 Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), without
the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary damages and without the
necessity of posting a bond or other security, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the other under this Agreement and this right shall include the right of the
Seller to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated. The Purchaser hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Purchaser
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement. The Parties
further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section_
__ _ 11.18_, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any
other form of relief that may be available under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) if this Agreement has been terminated or if the remedies
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 11.18_ are not available or otherwise are
not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.18_ shall
require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Partys right
to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section_ __
_ 11.18_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
_Article 9_  (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.18_
or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.18_ restrict or limit
any Partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Article 9_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter.

 

11.18 _Legal Representation_. In any Legal Proceeding by or against the
Purchaser wherein the Purchaser asserts or prosecutes any claim under, or
otherwise seeks to enforce, this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees in connection
with such Legal Proceeding (a) that neither the Purchaser nor counsel therefor
will move to seek disqualification of Holland and Knight, (b) to waive any
right the Purchaser may have to assert the attorney-client privilege against
Holland and Knight or the Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to any
communication or information contained in Holland and Knights possession or
files and (c) to consent to the representation of the Seller and its
Affiliates by Holland and Knight, notwithstanding that Holland and Knight has or
may have represented the Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiary) as counsel in connection with any matter,
including any transaction (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), negotiation, investigation, Legal Proceeding or action, prior to
the Closing. This consent and waiver extends to Holland and Knight representing
the Seller against the Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiary in litigation,
arbitration or mediation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition, all communications between the Seller, the
Company and their respective subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Holland and
Knight, on the other hand, related to this or any other proposed sale of the
Shares, the Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed
to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Seller and its
Affiliates (and not the Company or its Subsidiary) (the " _Seller  Pre-
Closing Communications_"). Accordingly, none of the Company, its Subsidiary
nor the Purchaser shall have access to any such Seller Pre-Closing
Communications or to the files of Holland and Knight relating to such
engagement from and after the Closing, and all books, records and other
materials of the Company or its Subsidiary in any medium (including electronic
copies) containing or reflecting any of the Seller Pre-Closing Communications
or the work product of legal counsel

 



63

    

 with respect thereto, including any related summaries, drafts or analyses,
and all rights with respect to any of the foregoing, are hereby retained by,
assigned and transferred to the Seller effective as of the Closing. Such
material and information shall be excluded from the transfer contemplated by
this Agreement and shall be delivered to the Seller at the Closing with no
copies thereof retained by the Company, its Subsidiary, the Purchaser or any
of the Purchasers Affiliates or Representatives. From and after the Closing,
the Purchaser, the Company and their respective Subsidiary, Affiliates and
Representatives shall maintain the confidentiality of all such material and
information. From and after the Closing, none of the Purchaser, the Company
and their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives shall access
or in any way, directly or indirectly, use or rely upon any such materials or
information. To the extent that any such materials or information are not
delivered to the Seller prior to the Closing, they will be held for the
benefit of the Seller, and the Purchaser, the Company and their respective
subsidiaries and Affiliates will deliver all such material and information to
the Seller promptly upon discovery thereof, without using or retaining copies
thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the
Closing, (a) the Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Company or its
Subsidiary) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement and the Seller Pre-Closing Communications, and
neither the Company nor its Subsidiary shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the
extent that files of Holland and Knight in respect of such engagement and with
respect to the Seller PreClosing Communications constitute property of the
client, only the Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Company or its
Subsidiary) shall hold such property rights and (c) Holland and Knight shall
have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications, files or the Seller Pre-Closing Communications to the Company
or its Subsidiary by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
Holland and Knight and the Company or its Subsidiary or otherwise. As to the
Seller Pre-Closing Communications, the Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiary), together with
any of their respective successors or assigns, agree that no such Person
may use or rely on any of the Seller Pre-Closing Communications in any action
or claim against or involving any of the Parties or any of their respective
Non-Recourse Parties after the Closing. The Purchaser further agrees that, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiary), Holland and Knights retention by the
Company and its Subsidiary shall be deemed completed and terminated without
any further action by any Person effective as of the Closing. The Purchaser
hereby acknowledges and confirms that it has had the opportunity to review and
obtain adequate information regarding the significance and risks of the
waivers and other terms and conditions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.18_,
including the opportunity to discuss with counsel such matters and reasonable
alternatives to such terms. This  _Section_ __ _ 11.18_ is for the benefit
of the Seller and Holland and Knight, and Holland and Knight is an intended third
party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 11.18_. This  _Section_ __ _
11.18_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section_ __ _ 11.18_ may be
amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of the Seller
and Holland and Knight. The covenants and obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.18_ shall survive for ten (10) years following the Closing
Date.
