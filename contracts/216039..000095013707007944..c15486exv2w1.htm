<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 9.11 <U>Severability</U>. If any term, covenant, restriction or provision of this
Agreement or the application of any such term, covenant, restriction or provision to any Person or
circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term,
covenant, restriction or provision hereof so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. The
parties shall engage in good faith negotiations to replace any term, covenant, restriction or
provision which is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable with a valid, legal and enforceable
term, covenant, restriction or provision, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible
to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable term, covenant, restriction or provision which it
replaces.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 9.12 <U>Specific Performance</U>. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive
of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties agree that
if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur for which no adequate remedy at
Law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions and specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy at Law or in equity, without the necessity of posting bonds or other
undertaking in connection therewith. The parties acknowledge that in absence of a waiver, a bond
or undertaking may be required by a court and the parties hereby waive any such requirement of such
a bond or undertaking.
