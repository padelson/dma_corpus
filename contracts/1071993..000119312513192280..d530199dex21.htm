Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such subsequent time as

(subject to _Section 6.7(b)_).

Section 1.7  _Officers and Directors_. From and after the Effective Time,
until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in

the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Company Restricted
Stock which has become vested and converted into unrestricted Company Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 1.9(b)_, but excluding any shares of Company
Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent or held directly or
indirectly by the Company, all of which shall be canceled as provided in 
_Section 1.8(d)_), shall be converted into the right to receive 0.08288 (such

accordance with _Section 1.10_ is referred to as the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
(the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(c) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of outstanding Company
Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such

 



3  shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as provided
herein or by Law.

(d) Each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Subsidiaries or held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including any shares held in the treasury of the Company) at the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be
canceled and retired and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

exercisable (collectively, the " _Company Stock Options_ ") shall cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall
be converted, at the Effective Time, into a fully vested and immediately
exercisable option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent
Stock Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Company Stock Option (but taking into account any changes thereto,
including the acceleration thereof, provided for in the Company Stock Plans,
in an award agreement or in such Company Stock Option by reason of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein), except that: (i) each
Parent Stock Option shall have an exercise price per share of Parent Common
Stock equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock for such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, up to the nearest whole cent; and (ii)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be subject to each
such Parent Stock Option shall be the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to each Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, down to the
nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in all cases
such conversion shall be effected in a manner consistent with the requirements
of Section 424(a) of the Code (as modified by Section 409A of the Code with
respect to Company Stock Options that are not intended to qualify as
"incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code).

(b) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted share
of Company Common Stock granted to any employee or director of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its predecessors under any Company Stock
Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become a
fully vested and unrestricted share of Company Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Board (or the appropriate
committee thereof) and the Company Board (or the appropriate committee
thereof) shall take such action and adopt such resolutions as are required to
effectuate the treatment of the Company 

 



4  Stock Options pursuant to the terms of _Section 1.9(a)_ of this Agreement,
and to take all actions reasonably required to effectuate any provision of
this _Section 1.9_, including (i) the Parent Board (or the appropriate
committee thereof) shall take all corporate action necessary or advisable to
assume and continue the Company Stock Plans subject to any amendment or
termination in accordance with the terms of such plans; (ii) the Parent Board
(or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take all corporate action
necessary or advisable to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares
of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of a Parent Stock Option;
and (iii) the Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take
all corporate action necessary or advisable to ensure that after the Effective
Time, neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to
deliver shares of Company Common Stock or any other capital stock to any
person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Stock Options.

(d) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
Form S-8 registration statement (or such other appropriate form), or a post-
effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the
Securities Act, with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock available
for grant and delivery under the Company Stock Plans from and after the
Effective Time and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such shares are
available for grant and delivery under the Company Stock Plans. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, the Company shall file a post-
effective amendment to the Form S-8 registration statement originally filed by
the Company on June 25, 2008, deregistering all shares of Company Common Stock
thereunder.

 

Section 1.10 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or different class
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up,
combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in
any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period,
or any similar event shall have occurred, the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted to proportionally reflect such changes.

 

Section 1.11 _Tax Consequences_. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger
is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. The Parties hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the United States Treasury Regulations.

 

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

Section 2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a commercial bank or trust company to act as exchange agent hereunder
(which entity shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) for the purpose
of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, Book-Entry Shares (or certificates if requested)
representing the Parent Common Stock issuable, pursuant to _Section 1.8_ in
exchange for outstanding shares of

 



5  Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock). Parent agrees to
make available directly or indirectly to the Exchange Agent from time to time
as needed, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.3_. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the
third Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent,
and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify (such letter to be reasonably acceptable to the
Company prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor pursuant to  _Section 2.5_ and any dividends or distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3_. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to  _Section 1.8_ (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B)
cash in the amount equal to cash that such holder has the right to receive in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.5_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (in each
case, after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held
by such holder).

 

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement.

(b) No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.5_.

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of
the Company, the Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange
therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such
Company Common Stock is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment or issuance pays any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

 



6 Section 2.3 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be
deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend
or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
dividends or other distributions declared or made in respect of the Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until the holder of such Certificate surrenders such Certificate in accordance
with this _Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest,
(a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock; and (b) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date at or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender
and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock.

Section 2.4  _No Further Ownership Rights_. All shares of Parent Common Stock
issued and cash paid upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of _Article I_ and this _Article II_ (including
any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.5_) shall be deemed
to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock (other than any rights with respect to
any unpaid dividends with respect to Company Common Stock that were declared
prior to the Effective Time with a record date prior to the Effective Time and
a payment date after the Effective Time).

 

Section 2.5 _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_.

 

(a) No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common
Stock multiplied by (ii) the Parent Share Cash Value.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent
shall so notify Parent, and 

 



7  Parent shall promptly deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit
such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to
forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 2.6 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or
otherwise on the instruction of Parent, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, the
Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled pursuant to  _Section
1.8_ and _Section 2.2_, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and
any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3_. Any such
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock five years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent
permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.7 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

Section 2.8 _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis
in (a) short term direct obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than 30 days, (b) short term obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for payment of all principal and interest or (c) commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poors;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to the Company stockholders pursuant to
_Article I_ and the other provisions of this _Article II_. If for any reason
(including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund will be insufficient to
fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange
Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Parent.

 

Section 2.9 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section
2.3_, as the case may be, deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



8 Section 2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Stock or any other Equity Interests in the Company such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be remitted to the applicable
Governmental Entity and such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock or other Equity
Interests in the Company, as the case may be, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent.

Section 2.11 _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 2.12 _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed at the close of business on the day on which the Effective
Time occurs and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares
of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent
for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with respect
to the shares of Company Common Stock or formerly represented thereby
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5_) and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.3_.

disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors" or "forward-looking
statements") or (ii) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter delivered
by the Company to Parent prior to or concurrent with the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), which identifies items of
disclosure by reference to a particular section or subsection of this
Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any information set forth in one
section of such Company Disclosure Letter also shall be deemed to apply to
each other section and subsection of this Agreement to which its relevance is
reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted, except with respect to the
Companys Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in
good standing, or to have such power or authority when taken together with all
other such failures, has not, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the
concept of good standing) as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority
when taken together with all other such failures, has not, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent and Merger Sub a

correct list, as of the Closing, of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock or any other
rights to purchase or receive Company Common Stock granted under the Company

on the stock price performance of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than under the Company Stock Plans) or to cause the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to file a registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ").

 

(e) Except as set forth in this _Section 3.2_ or in Section 3.2(e) of the

reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. No Subsidiary of the Company owns any Company Common Stock
or other Equity Interest in the Company. 

Section 3.3 _Corporate Authority_.

all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, subject, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section 4.23_, only to the
adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding capital stock of the Company entitled to vote
thereon (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), and to the filing and
recording of the Certificate of Merger under the provisions of the DGCL. The
Company Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Company necessary to adopt, approve or
authorize this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly authorized and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles
(the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

regulation (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") or any anti-takeover provision in
the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws is, or at the Effective
Time will be, applicable to the Company Common Stock, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 4.23_, the Company Board has taken all action so that Parent will
not be prohibited from entering into a "business combination" with the Company
(as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as a result of the
execution of this Agreement, or the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, without any further action on the part of
the Company stockholders or the Company Board.

entity (" _Governmental Entity_ "), in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Company, the consummation by the Company of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or the Companys compliance with
any of the provisions of this Agreement will (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both), (i) subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
conflict with or violate any provision of the Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or any equivalent organizational or governing
documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries; (ii) assuming that all
consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in this  _Section
3.4_ have been obtained and all filings and notifications described in this
_Section 3.4_ have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have
terminated or expired, conflict with or violate any Law or Order
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets; or (iii) require any consent or approval

complete and correct list of each material "employee benefit plan" as defined

not subject to ERISA), and any other material plan, policy, program,
practice, agreement, understanding or arrangement (whether written or oral)
providing compensation or other benefits to any current or former director,
officer, employee or consultant (or to any dependent or beneficiary thereof)
of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, which are now maintained, sponsored or

purchase, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted
stock, restricted stock unit, stock-based compensation, change-in-control,
retention, employment, consulting, personnel or severance policies, programs,
practices, Contracts or arrangements (each, a " _Company Benefit Plan_ "),

_Foreign Benefit Plans_ " shall mean those Company Benefit Plans maintained,
sponsored or contributed to primarily for the benefit of current or former
employees of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate who are or were regularly
employed outside the United States (but which shall exclude any such Company
Benefit Plans to the extent required by applicable foreign Law to be so
maintained, sponsored or contributed to). Not more than 20 Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver a true, complete
and correct list of each Foreign Benefit Plan to Parent. For purposes of this
_Section 3.12_ and _Section 4.12_, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " shall mean any
entity (whether or not incorporated) that, together with any other entity, is
considered under common control and treated as one employer under Sections

respect to a termination, modification or change required by ERISA or the Code
or which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
with respect to each Company Benefit Plan (other than any Foreign Benefit
Plan), the Company has made available to Parent true, complete and correct
copies of the following (as applicable): (i) the written document evidencing

and (viii) all material amendments, modifications or supplements to any
Company Benefit Plan. With respect to each Foreign Benefit Plan, the Company
will provide to Parent not more than 20 Business Days after the date of this
Agreement the items identified in each of _clauses (i)_ through _(viii)_

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms, applicable Law (including Section 409A of the Code)
and any applicable collective bargaining agreement, including, in all material
respects, timely filing of all Tax, annual reporting and other governmental
filings required by ERISA and the Code and timely contribution (or, if not yet
due, proper financial reporting) of any amounts required to be made under the
terms of any of the Company Benefit Plans as of the date of this
Agreement. With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred
and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be subject to any liability that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each Company Benefit
Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401 of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS to such effect and, to
the Companys Knowledge, no fact, circumstance or event has occurred or exists
since the date of such determination letter that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan.
None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of and, to
the Companys Knowledge, there are no audits or investigations by any
Governmental Entity with respect to, or other Actions against or involving
any Company Benefit Plan or asserting rights or claims to benefits under any
Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits payable in the
normal course). Other than as set forth in Section 3.12(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, each Company Benefit Plan subject to ERISA that provides
retiree healthcare or life insurance benefits in the United States provides by
its terms that it may be amended or terminated without material liability to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time after the Effective Time
(other than as required by applicable Law).

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
no Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Sections
3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" within
the meaning of Sections 4063/4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code and
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has sponsored or contributed to or
been required to contribute to, or has any liability with respect to,
a "multiemployer plan" or "multiple employer plan."

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to, or in
the past has maintained or contributed to, any "employee benefit plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA. With respect to each plan set forth
in Section 3.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter that is subject to Section
412 of the Code or Section 302 of Title IV of ERISA, except to the extent
that the event or condition in question would not give rise to a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (i) there does not exist any accumulated funding
deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) there has been no "reportable

 



20  event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations
thereunder which required a notice to the PBGC which has not been fully and
accurately reported in a timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or
not reported, would constitute grounds for the PBGC to institute involuntary
termination proceedings with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA; (iii) all premiums to the PBGC have been timely
paid in full; (iv) there has not been a partial termination; and (v) none of
the following events has occurred: (A) the filing of a notice of intent to
terminate, (B) the treatment of an amendment to such a Company Benefit Plan
as a termination under Section 4041 of ERISA or (C) the commencement of
proceedings by the PBGC to terminate such a Company Benefit Plan and, to the
Companys Knowledge, no condition exists that presents a substantial risk
that such proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute grounds
under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a
trustee to administer, any such plan.

 

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger will not
constitute an event that, either alone or in conjunction with any other event,
will or may result in (i) any payment, acceleration, termination, forgiveness
of Indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in compensation or benefits
or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any current or former employee
or other personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any amount
failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or (iii) the
provision of any reimbursement of excise Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code
or any income Taxes under the Code.

(g) (i) Each Foreign Benefit Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in compliance with its terms and all applicable Laws and Orders
of any controlling Governmental Entity; (ii) each Foreign Benefit Plan
required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good
standing with applicable regulatory authorities; and (iii) each Foreign

reserved, as appropriate, in accordance with applicable Law.

Section 3.13 _Labor Matters_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in
material compliance with all applicable Laws of the United States, or of any
state or local government or any subdivision thereof or of any foreign

discrimination, sexual harassment, disability rights or benefits, equal
opportunity, plant closure issues, affirmative action, workers compensation,
employee benefits, severance payments, COBRA, labor relations, employee leave
issues, wage and hour standards, occupational safety and health requirements
and unemployment insurance and related matters. Except as specifically
identified on Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any labor union
or collective bargaining agreement. There is no unfair labor practice charge
pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened which if determined
adversely to the Company or its Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To
the Companys Knowledge, there are no organizational campaigns, petitions or
other activities or proceedings of any labor union, workers council or labor
organization (a) seeking recognition of a collective bargaining unit with
respect to any of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(b) compelling the Company or any 

 



21  of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any such labor union, works council or
labor organization. There are no material strikes, slowdowns, walkouts, work
stoppages or other labor-related controversies pending or, to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
experienced any such strike, slowdown, walkout, work stoppage or other labor-
related controversy within the past three years.

respects, and all material amounts of Taxes shown to be due on such Tax
Returns, or otherwise owed, have been or will be timely paid. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries, with respect to all income and other material
Tax Returns filed by or with respect to any of them, have not waived any
statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of
time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency other than an extension
attributable to an extension to file any such Tax Returns. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing
authority all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any current or former employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other Third Party and have
complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws, rules
and regulations relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes.

(b) Except as would not have and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) no

liability (exclusive of interest) in connection with an audit or
other administrative or court proceeding involving Taxes of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 3.23_,
only to the approval of the Parent Share Issuance by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the capital stock of Parent entitled to vote
thereon present in person or by proxy at a meeting duly called for such
purpose (the " _Parent Stockholder Approval_ "), and to the filing and
recording of the Certificate of Merger under the provisions of the DGCL.

Merger, the Parent Share Issuance and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed

binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

Effective Time will be, applicable to the Parent Common Stock, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section
3.23_, the Parent Board has taken all action so that the Company will not be
prohibited from entering into a "business combination" with Parent (as such
term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as a result of the execution of this
Agreement, or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, without any further action on the part of Parent
stockholders or the Parent Board.

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
by Parent or Merger Sub, the consummation by Parent of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or Parents or Merger Subs
compliance with any of the

 



35  provisions of this Agreement will (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both), (i) subject to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, conflict
with or violate any provision of Parents or Merger Subs certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or any equivalent organizational or governing
documents of any of Parents or Merger Subs Subsidiaries; (ii) assuming that
all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in this
_Section 4.4_ have been obtained and all filings and notifications described
in this _Section 4.4_ have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have
terminated or expired, conflict with or violate any Law or Order applicable
to Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets; or (iii) require any consent or approval under, violate,
conflict with, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or
constitute a default under, or result in termination or give to others any
right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien, other than Permitted Liens, upon any of the
respective properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to, any Contract, permit or other instrument or obligation to which Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries is a party or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, with
respect to _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for any such conflicts, violations,
consents, approvals, authorizations, permits, breaches, losses, defaults,
other occurrences or Liens which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5 _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 4.5(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
since July 1, 2010, each of Parent and Merger Sub has timely filed or
otherwise furnished (as applicable) all registration statements, prospectuses,
forms, reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules, statements and
documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, together with all certifications required pursuant to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (such documents and any other documents filed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with the SEC, including exhibits and other
information incorporated therein as they have been supplemented, modified or
amended since the time of filing, collectively, the " _Parent SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing),
the Parent SEC Documents (i) did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) complied
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
or the Securities Act, as the case may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. Each Parent SEC
Document to be filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement will have
complied in all material respects with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be. None of Parents Subsidiaries
is required to make any filings with the SEC. All of the audited consolidated
financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (together with the related
notes and schedules thereto, collectively, the " _Parent
Financial Statements_ ") (A) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Parent and Parents Subsidiaries in all
material respects, (B) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of interim financial statements, for normal
and recurring year-end adjustments)

 



36  and (C) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and changes in
stockholders equity of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates and for
the periods referred to therein.

(b) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

(c) Parents disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as required by Rules 13a-15(a) and
15d-15(a) of the Exchange Act, are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within Parent to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as required under the
Exchange Act and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms. Parent has evaluated
the effectiveness of Parents disclosure controls and procedures and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC
Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto,
its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment
based on such evaluation. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to its outside
auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (i) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal control over financial reporting. There has not been any such
disclosure made by management to Parents outside auditors or the audit
committee of the Parent Board since July 1, 2010.

 

(d) To Parents Knowledge, none of the Parent SEC Documents (other than
confidential treatment requests) is the subject of ongoing SEC review. Parent
has made available to the Company true and complete copies of all written
comment letters from the staff of the SEC received since January 1, 2011
through the date of this Agreement relating to the Parent SEC Documents
and all written responses of Parent thereto through the date of this
Agreement other than with respect to requests for confidential treatment. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any Parent SEC
Documents other than confidential treatment requests. To Parents Knowledge,
as of the date of this Agreement, there are no SEC inquiries or
investigations, other governmental inquiries or investigations or internal
investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting
practices of Parent.

 

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since June 30, 2012 through the date
of this Agreement, (a) the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries has been
conducted in the ordinary course in all material respects and (b) there has
not been any event, occurrence, development or state of circumstances or facts
or condition that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



37 Section 4.7 _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. There are no liabilities
or obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued,

disclosed and provided for in the balance sheets included in the Parent
Financial Statements (or in the notes thereto) filed and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement; (b) liabilities or obligations incurred
in accordance with or in connection with this Agreement; (c) liabilities or
obligations incurred since December 31, 2012 in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice; and (d) liabilities or obligations
that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract or
arrangement (including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand), or
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K under the Exchange Act), where the result, purpose or effect of such
Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in
the Parent Financial Statements or the Parent SEC Documents.

 

Section 4.8 _Litigation_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 4.8(a) of
the Parent Disclosure Letter, there are no Actions pending or, to Parents
Knowledge, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or properties that if
determined adversely to Parent would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries or, to Parents Knowledge, any of their respective assets or
properties, is subject to any outstanding Order, writ, injunction, decree or
arbitration ruling, award or other finding that would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 4.8_ do not
apply to Environmental Laws, Environmental Permits or Hazardous Materials, as
representations and warranties made by Parent and its Subsidiaries with regard
to all environmental matters, including Environmental Laws, Environmental
Permits and Hazardous Materials are solely and exclusively made in _Section
4.17_ of this Agreement.

Section 4.9 _Compliance with Laws_.

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Laws or
Orders, except where any such failure to be in compliance has not had, or
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. To Parents Knowledge, no investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
indicated an intention to conduct the same which, in each case, would
reasonably be expected to

 



38  have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To Parents Knowledge, Parent is in
material compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended, and any rules and regulations thereunder.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 4.9_ do not

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent or
one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, (i) holds good and valid title to
all of the properties and assets reflected in the December 31, 2012 balance
sheet included in the Parent SEC Documents as being owned by Parent or one of
its Subsidiaries or acquired after the date thereof that are material to
Parents business on a consolidated basis (except for properties and assets
sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course
of business) (collectively, with respect to real property, the " _Parent
Owned Real Property_ "), free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted
Liens and other matters described in Section 4.10(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter; (ii) holds the Parent Owned Real Property, or any portion thereof or
interest therein, free of any outstanding options or rights of first refusal

included in the Parent SEC Documents or acquired after the date thereof that
are material to Parents business on a consolidated basis (except for leases

terminated or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business)
(collectively, with respect to real property, the " _Parent Leased Real
Property_ "); (iv) is in possession of the Parent Leased Real Property, and
each lease underlying the Parent Leased Real Property is valid and in full
force and effect, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent or the
applicable Subsidiary of Parent, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity

Real Property.

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 4.10_ do not

to all oil and gas matters are solely and exclusively made in _Section 4.15_.

any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than in respect of Indebtedness
for borrowed money of a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent) in excess of
$4,000,000;

 



39 (ii) Non-competition agreements or any other agreements or arrangements that
materially limit or otherwise materially restrict Parent or any of its

restrict Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) or any successor thereto, in each case from engaging or competing
in any line of business or in any geographic area, which agreement or
arrangements would reasonably be expected to materially limit, materially

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including for purposes of such determination,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), after giving effect to the

are referred to herein as the " _Parent Material Contracts_." Except, in each
case, as has not, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) all Parent Material

of or default under or permit termination, modification or acceleration
under) any Parent Material Contract or any other Contract to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective material properties or assets is bound, except for
violations or defaults that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.12 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Section 4.12(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of each material "employee benefit plan" as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), and any other
material plan, policy, program, practice, agreement, understanding or
arrangement (whether written or oral) providing compensation or other benefits
to any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant (or to any
dependent or beneficiary thereof) of Parent or any ERISA Affiliate, which are
now maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or any ERISA Affiliate,
or under which Parent or any ERISA Affiliate has any material obligation or
liability, whether actual or contingent, including all incentive, bonus,
deferred compensation, vacation, holiday, cafeteria, medical, disability,
stock purchase, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted
stock, restricted stock unit, stock-based compensation, change-in-control,
retention, employment, consulting, personnel or severance policies, programs,
practices, Contracts or arrangements (each, a " _Parent Benefit Plan_ "),
excluding Foreign Benefit Plans. Not more than 20 Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, Parent shall deliver a true, complete and correct list
of each Foreign Benefit Plan to the Company. Parent has no express or implied
commitment to terminate or modify or change any Parent Benefit Plan, other
than with respect to a termination, modification or change required by ERISA
or the Code or which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan (other than any Foreign Benefit
Plan), Parent has made available to the Company true, complete and correct
copies of the following (as applicable): (i) the written document evidencing
such Parent Benefit Plan or, with respect to any such plan that is not in
writing, a written description of the material terms thereof; (ii) the summary
plan description; (iii) the most recent annual report, financial statement
and/or actuarial report; (iv) the most recent determination letter from the
IRS; (v) the most recent Form 5500 required to have been filed with the IRS,
including all schedules thereto; (vi) any related trust agreements, insurance

amendments, modifications or supplements to any Parent Benefit Plan. With
respect to each Foreign Benefit Plan, Parent will provide to the Company not
more than 20 Business Days after the date of this Agreement the items
identified in each of  _clauses (i)_ through _(viii)_ above, to the extent
applicable.

 



41 (c) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
each Parent Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms, applicable Law (including Section 409A of the Code)
and any applicable collective bargaining agreement, including, in all material
respects, timely filing of all Tax, annual reporting and other governmental
filings required by ERISA and the Code and timely contribution (or, if not yet
due, proper financial reporting) of any amounts required to be made under the
terms of any of the Parent Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement.
With respect to the Parent Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and there
exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries would be subject to any liability that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended
to be "qualified" under Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS to such effect and, to Parents Knowledge,
no fact, circumstance or event has occurred or exists since the date of such
determination letter that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the qualified status of any such Parent Benefit Plan. None of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has received notice of and, to Parents Knowledge, there are
no audits or investigations by any Governmental Entity with respect to, or
other Actions against or involving any Parent Benefit Plan or asserting
rights or claims to benefits under any Parent Benefit Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits payable in the normal course). Other than as set forth in
Section 4.12(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, each Parent Benefit Plan
subject to ERISA that provides retiree healthcare or life insurance benefits
in the United States provides by its terms that it may be amended or
terminated without material liability to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries at
any time after the Effective Time (other than as required by applicable Law).

(d) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
no Parent Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Sections 3(37)
and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning

Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement relating to the
meetings of the Companys stockholders and Parents 

 



57  stockholders to be held in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ ") and a registration
statement on Form S-4 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Form S-4_ "), in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall, upon the reasonable request
by the Other Party, furnish to the Other Party all information as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Form S-4. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of the Parties shall mail or deliver the Joint Proxy
Statement to its respective stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Form S-4 has been declared effective under the Securities Act.
Parent may file the opinion described in _Section 7.2(c)_, and the Company
may file the opinion described in _Section 7.3(c)_, in each case with the SEC
by post-effective amendment to the Form S-4. Parent shall also use its

by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning it
and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. Each of Parent and the Company shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, provide the Other

Parties shall cooperate and provide the Other Party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC and will
provide the Other Party with a copy of all such filings with the SEC to the
extent not otherwise publicly available. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time, Parent or the Company has Knowledge of any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective officers, directors or
other Affiliates, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement so that any such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the Other Party and, to the extent required
by applicable Laws, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such

stockholders of Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by

be made without the approval of both Parent and the Company, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company, in connection with a Change in Company
Recommendation, and Parent, in connection with a Change in
Parent Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement
and/or the Form S-4 (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a
Qualifying Amendment to effect such a change, and in such event, this right of
approval shall apply only 

 



58  with respect to information relating to the Other Party or its business,
financial condition or results of operations, and shall be subject to the
right of each Party to have its Boards deliberations and conclusions be
accurately described. A " _Qualifying Amendment_ " means an amendment or

incorporation by reference) to the extent that it contains (a) a Change in
Company Recommendation or a Change in Parent Recommendation (as the case may
be), (b) a statement of the reasons of the Company Board or Parent Board (as
the case may be) for making such Change in Company Recommendation or a Change
in Parent Recommendation (as the case may be), and (c) additional information

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Law, each of the Company
and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
Other Party and its Representatives reasonable access, at such Other Partys
expense, during normal business hours, to all of its properties, books,
Contracts, commitments, financial and operating data, records, and officers
and employees and, during such period, the Parties shall, shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their Representatives to, make available to the Other Party all other
information concerning their businesses, properties and personnel as the Other
Party may reasonably request. Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Other Party, to the extent
not publicly available, a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of the federal securities Laws. Neither the Company nor Parent
nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of such
Party or any of its Subsidiaries or where such Party determines in good
faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that such access or disclosure
is reasonably likely to jeopardize the attorney-client or other legal
privilege of such Party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law, Order
or binding agreement. If any material is withheld by such Party pursuant to
the preceding sentence, such Party shall inform the Other Party as to the
general nature of what is being withheld.

 

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

_Parent Stockholder Meeting_ ," respectively), and each shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective. The Company and Parent
shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Stockholder
Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting to be held on the same day

 



59  at substantially the same time. The Company Board has resolved to recommend
to the Companys stockholders that such stockholders vote in favor of the

submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder
Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, and the
Company and its Board shall use their reasonable best efforts to solicit and
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The Parent Board has resolved
to recommend to its stockholders that such stockholders vote in favor of the
Parent Share Issuance (the " _Parent Recommendation_ "). Unless otherwise
agreed by the Parties, the Parent Share Issuance shall be submitted to the
stockholders of Parent at the Parent Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, and Parent and its Board shall use
their reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain the Parent Stockholder
Approval. The Company and Parent shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting or the Parent Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, except
to the extent required by applicable Law or to solicit additional proxies and
votes in favor of (a) in the case of the Company, the adoption of this
Agreement if sufficient votes to constitute the Company Stockholder Approval
have not been obtained; or (b) in the case of Parent, the Parent Share
Issuance if sufficient votes to constitute the Parent Stockholder Approval
have not been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed
to by the Parties, neither the Company Stockholder Meeting nor the Parent
Stockholder Meeting may be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than
20 Business Days after the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting or
the Parent Stockholder Meeting, as the case may be, was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law).

 

Section 6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply as promptly as reasonably practicable with all legal requirements that
may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger,
the Parent Share Issuance and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the furnishing of information for, and the preparation
and filing of, all necessary and proper statements, forms, registrations,
filings, notices, representation letters, and declarations related to the
Merger); (b) to cause the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in a reasonably expeditious manner; and (c) to obtain (and to cooperate with
the Other Party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, Order or
approval of, or any exemption or waiver by, any Governmental Entity
(including any Requisite Approvals) and any other Third Party that is required
to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Upon either Partys receipt of a communication
from any Governmental Entity that causes such Party to believe that there is a
reasonable likelihood that any Stockholder Approval will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any required consent or approval may be materially
delayed, such Party shall promptly (i) advise the Other Party and (ii) to the
extent permitted by Law, provide the Other Party with a copy of such
communication. 

Section 6.5 _NYSE Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger and such other shares of Parent Common Stock
to be reserved for

practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event, prior to the
Closing Date.

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) To the extent that employees of Parent or its Affiliates (including
employees of Parent or its Affiliates who are employed under a co-employment
relationship with a professional employer organization that provides employee
services to Parent or its Affiliates) immediately prior to the Effective Time
remain employed by Parent, or any of its Affiliates (including through co-
employment with such professional employer organization) after the Effective
Time (the " _Parent Employees_ "), each such Parent Employee will receive a
base salary or hourly rate of pay, as applicable, at least equal to that
in effect for such Parent Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
until the date that is one year after the Effective Time. All Parent Employees
and other Persons listed in Section 6.6(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter
shall continue to be entitled to any deferred bonus previously granted by
Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement, such bonuses
in the aggregate not to exceed the amount set forth on Section 6.6(a) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter. Beginning on the date that is one year after the
Effective Time, the base salary or hourly rate of pay, as applicable, for any
Parent Employee who remains employed by the Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including through co-employment with such professional employer
organization) may be adjusted as deemed appropriate by Parent.

(b) The Parties shall cause each benefit plan in which employees of the
Company or any of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time who
remain employed by the Parent or any of its Affiliates immediately following
the Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") are eligible to participate
after the Effective Time to take into account, to the extent consistent and
compatible with the terms of the applicable benefit plan, for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under such benefit plans,
the service of the Company Employees with the Company and its Affiliates to
the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by the Company
or its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such credited service shall
not result in a duplication of benefits. With respect to Parent Employees,
the Parties shall cause each benefit plan in which Parent Employees are
eligible to participate to take into account, to the extent consistent and
compatible with the terms of the applicable benefit plan, for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under such benefit plans, the service
of the Parent Employees with Parent, its Affiliates and such professional
employer organization to the same extent as such service was credited for
such purpose by Parent, its Affiliates, or such professional employer
organization; _provided_ , _however_ , that such credited service shall not
result in a duplication of benefits. Nothing herein shall limit the ability
of Parent or its Affiliates to amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit
Plans or Parent Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms after the
Effective Time.

(c) If Parent Employees become eligible to participate in Company Benefit
Plans that are health plans, to the extent allowable by the applicable
insurance carrier, if any, or applicable plan, the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such plan to (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered
under the applicable life, disability, medical, health or dental plans, (ii)
honor under such plans any

 



61  deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such employees
and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the Effective Time for the year in which the Effective Time or
participation in such plans, as applicable, occurs. 

(d) At a date determined by Parent after the Effective Time, the accounts
(including any loan balances) of Parent Employees in the 401(k) savings plan
in which Parent Employees participate will be transferred to the Companys
401(k) savings plan, in accordance with the requirements of the applicable
plan and of applicable Law. The Company shall make such amendments to the
Companys 401(k) savings plan, and shall take such other actions, as may be
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the transfer of Parent Employees
401(k) plan accounts.

 

(e) For the applicable fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, the
Parent Employees (other than the estate of Parents immediate past Chairman
and Parents current Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, as
provided below), and the Company Employees will be eligible to receive an
annual bonus that will be calculated as follows: (i) solely with respect to
the Company Employees, for the period that begins on the first day of the
applicable fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs and ends on the date
of the Effective Time, a pro-rated performance-based bonus determined and
calculated pursuant to the attainment of the applicable performance goals in
their respective annual incentive plans in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, pro-rated based on the number of days elapsed from the
beginning of the applicable fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs to
the date of the Effective Time (but paid at the time noted below); and (ii)
with respect to the Parent Employees (other than the estate of Parents
immediate past Chairman and Parents current Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer, as provided below) and the Company Employees, for the
period that begins on the date immediately following the date of the Effective
Time (or, for Parent Employees, July 1, 2013, if the Effective Time occurs
after June 30, 2013) and ends on December 31, 2013, a discretionary bonus
amount that shall be determined by the Compensation Committee of Parents
Board after the Effective Time. The aggregate annual bonus amount, if any
described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be paid between January 1, 2014 and
March 15, 2014, subject to any forfeiture restrictions that would apply to
such a bonus payment in the event that the applicable Parent Employee or
Company Employee is no longer providing services to the Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) on
December 31, 2013. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
with respect to the annual bonus payments to be made to both (A) the estate
of Parents immediate past Chairman who served prior to April 19, 2013 for
Parents fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 and (B) Parents current Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer for Parents fiscal year ending June 30,
2013 and, in the event that the Effective Time has not occurred prior to July
1, 2013, Parents short fiscal year that will begin July 1, 2013, the amount
of such bonuses shall be determined in accordance with the criteria previously
approved by the Parent Board, which bonuses shall not exceed the individual
amounts set forth in Section 5.2(n) of the Parent Disclosure Letter. For
other Parent Employees, Parent may pay discretionary annual bonuses and
retention bonuses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 as the Parent Board
deems appropriate and as in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice; _provided_ , _however_ , that such bonuses may not exceed
$600,000 in the aggregate.

 



62 (f) As of, or as soon as administratively practicable following, the Effective
Time, Parent shall establish (i) an annual bonus program, which shall be the
same as, or based substantially on the terms of, the Company Cash Incentive
Bonus Plan, for the calendar year beginning January 1, 2014 (which will be the
first fiscal year that immediately follows the fiscal year in which the
Effective Time occurs pursuant to Section 6.14(a)), and (ii) a revised long
term incentive plan, which is the same as, or based substantially on the terms
of, the Company Long-Term Incentive Plan (which is a sub-plan governed by the
Companys 2005 Stock Incentive Plan), with shares to be issued under Parents
2009 Equity Compensation Plan.

(g) Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.5_, this _Section 6.6_
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and
nothing in this  _Section 6.6_, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any other Person, including, any current or former director, officer or
employee of the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section
6.6_. Nothing in this _Section 6.6_, express or implied, shall be (i) deemed
an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, or (ii)
construed to prevent any Party or its Affiliates from terminating or
modifying to any extent or in any respect any employee benefit plan that a
Party or its Affiliates may establish or maintain.

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual Action, whether civil, criminal
or administrative, in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who
is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director or officer of another Person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is,
or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) all acts
or omissions by him taken at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time, or (iii) this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted
or arising before or after the Effective Time, the Parties shall cooperate and
use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and any agreement set forth in Section 6.7(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, each such Indemnified Party against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reimbursement for reasonable fees and expenses incurred in advance of the
final disposition of any such Action upon receipt of any undertaking required
by applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual Action.

(b) Unless required by applicable law, no provision in any certificate or
articles of incorporation, bylaws, or comparable organizational documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing indemnification, advancement
or exculpation shall for a period of six years following the Effective Time
be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights or protections thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time
were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

 



63 (c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties with respect to acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such
directors and officers in their capacity as such, the existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company as of the date
of this Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policy). The Company
may, in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in
both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the
current policies of directors, officers and employees liability insurance
maintained by the Company with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time that were committed by such directors, officers and
employees in their capacity as such. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall Parent be required to, and the Company shall not, expend more than
250% per year of coverage of the amount currently expended by the Company per
year of coverage as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ")
to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto. If Parent is unable
to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this _Section 6.7(c)_,
Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Maximum
Amount. The Indemnified Parties may be required to make reasonable application
and provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to
Parents insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance,
comparable in nature and scope to the applications, representations and
warranties required of Persons who are directors and officers of Parent as of
the date of this Agreement.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or
acquiror of such assets), as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section
6.7_.

Section 6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the
one hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other) or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of either Party, the proper officers and
directors of each Party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense
of, Parent.

 



64 Section 6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each Party shall promptly advise the Other
Party of any change or event (a) having or reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on it or (b) that it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the
failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, with
respect to the Company, or  _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_, with respect to
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements of the Parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that a failure to
comply with this _Section 6.9_ shall not constitute the failure of any
condition set forth in  _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying
Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied.

 

Section 6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take such actions as may be
necessary to cause dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
Derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any individual who is
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will
become subject to such requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with the
procedures set forth in such Rule 16b-3 and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999).

Section 6.11 _No Solicitation_.

(a) None of the Company or Parent (each, a " _No-Shop Party_ ") or their
respective Subsidiaries or any Representative of such No-Shop Party or any of
its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate, directly or indirectly (including by way
of furnishing non-public information), or take any other action designed to
facilitate, any inquiry or proposal regarding an Alternative Transaction
involving such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries (an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ "); (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an
Alternative Transaction; or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any
Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a No-Shop Party shall
be permitted, prior to the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval of such No-
Shop Party, and subject to first entering into a confidentiality agreement
with the Person proposing such Acquisition Proposal on terms
substantially similar to, and no less favorable to such No-Shop Party than,
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to (i) furnish information
(including non-public information) concerning such No-Shop Party and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives and afford such Person and its Representatives access to the
business, properties, assets, Contracts, officers, employees, books and
records of such No-Shop Party and its Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such No-Shop Party shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to
such Person provide to the Other Party any non-public information or access
that is provided or made available to such Person or its Representatives
unless such information or access has been previously been provided or made
available to the Other Party; and (ii) consider and participate in discussions
and negotiations with respect to such Acquisition Proposal received by such
No-Shop Party, in each case, if and only to the extent that (A) such
Acquisition Proposal is an

 



65  unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of
this Agreement; (B) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of
this _Section 6.11_(a), and (C) the Board of such No-Shop Party reasonably
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal.

 

(b) Other than in accordance with _Section 6.11(c)_ or _Section 6.11(e)_
below, the Board of a No-Shop Party shall not (i) fail to make the Company
Recommendation or the Parent Recommendation, as the case may be; (ii) withdraw
or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to the Other Party, or publicly
propose to withdraw or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Other Party,
the Company Recommendation or the Parent Recommendation, as the case may be;
(iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; (iv) fail to reaffirm the Company
Recommendation or the Parent Recommendation, as the case may be, within three
Business Days upon the request of the Other Party ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Other Party may make such request only following the
public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal and then only once for each
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Other Party may make
another request every time any material revisions are made to such Acquisition
Proposal (it being agreed that any change in the purchase price in such
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a material revision)); or (v) fail to
include the Company Recommendation or Parent Recommendation (as the case may
be) in the Joint Proxy Statement (any action described in _clauses (i)_
through _(v)_ a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ " or a " _Change in
Parent Recommendation_ ," as applicable).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.11_, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval or Parent
Stockholder Approval, as applicable, if a No-Shop Party has received a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not obtained in violation of
_Section 6.11(a)_, that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that
the Board of such No-Shop Party has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments
which may be offered by the Other Party pursuant to clause (ii) below (if
applicable), the Board of such No-Shop Party may (1) effect a Change in
Company Recommendation or a Change in Parent Recommendation, as applicable;
and/or (2) terminate the Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
regarding a Superior Proposal if the following conditions are met:

(i) in the case of any action described in either _clause (1)_ or _clause
(2)_ above, the Board of such No-Shop Party shall have determined in good
faith that such action is necessary in order to comply with the fiduciary
duties of its directors under applicable Law;

(ii) in the case of any action described in either _clause (1)_ or _clause
(2)_ above, (A) such No-Shop Party shall have provided prior written notice
to the Other Party in accordance with _Section 9.2_ (the " _Superior Proposal
Notice_ ") of its intention to effect a Change in Company Recommendation or
a Change in Parent Recommendation, as applicable, and/or terminate the
Agreement, which Superior Proposal Notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal), and contemporaneously with providing such
Superior Proposal Notice shall have provided a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the Person making

 



66  such Superior Proposal and other material documents; (B) during the period
that commences on the date of delivery of the Superior Proposal Notice as
determined in accordance with  _Section 9.2_ and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central
time on the date that is the fifth Business Day following the date of such
delivery (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "), such No-Shop Party
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the Other Party
and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent the Other Party desires
to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and (C) the Board of such No-Shop Party shall have considered all
revisions to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by the
Other Party and, at the end of the Superior Proposal Notice Period, shall
have determined in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal even if such revisions were to be given effect.
In the event that during the Superior Proposal Notice Period any
revisions are made to such Acquisition Proposal and the Board of such No-Shop
Party in its good faith judgment determines such revisions are material (it
being agreed that any change in the purchase price in such Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed a material revision), the No-Shop Party shall be
required to deliver a new Superior Proposal Notice and to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 6.11(c)_ with respect to such new Superior
Proposal Notice (except that the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall end at
11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the second Business Day following
the date of the delivery of such Superior Proposal Notice); and

 

(iii) in the case of any action described in clause (2) above, such No-Shop
Party shall have (A) complied in all material respects with its obligations
under this _Section 6.11_; and (B) paid the applicable Termination Fee to the
Other Party in accordance with _Section 8.3(d)_.

 

(d) Each No-Shop Party shall notify the Other Party promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or
any request for non-public information relating to such No-Shop Party or any
of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties,
assets, Contracts, officers, employees, books and records of such No-Shop
Party and its Subsidiaries by any Person that informs such No-Shop Party or
any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to the Other Party shall be made orally and
in writing and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Acquisition
Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the business,
properties, assets, Contracts, officers, employees, books and records of such
No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries, and the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment to an Acquisition
Proposal. Each No-Shop Party shall keep the Other Party informed as fully as
reasonably practical on a prompt basis, and in any event within 24 hours, of
any material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications
in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. Each
No-Shop Party shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify
the Other Party, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or
negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal in accordance with this
_Section 6.11_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 6.11_, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval or Parent Stockholder
Approval, as

 



67  applicable, in circumstances not involving or relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, if the Board of such No-Shop Party has concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
that that such action is necessary in order to comply with the fiduciary
duties of its directors under applicable Law, after giving effect to all of
the adjustments which may be offered by the Other Party pursuant to clause
(ii) below (if applicable), the Board of such No-Shop Party may effect a
Change in Company Recommendation or a Change in Parent Recommendation, as
applicable, if the following conditions are met:

 

(i) such No-Shop Party shall have provided prior written notice to the Other
Party in accordance with _Section 9.2_ (the " _Fiduciary Notice_ ") of its
intention to effect a Change in Company Recommendation or a Change in Parent
Recommendation, as applicable, and such Fiduciary Notice shall have specified
the reasons for the Change in Company Recommendation or a Change in Parent
Recommendation, as applicable;

(ii) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the
Fiduciary Notice as determined in accordance with _Section 9.2_ and ends at
11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth Business Day following
the date of such delivery (the " _Fiduciary Notice Period_ "), such No-Shop
Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the Other
Party and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent the Other Party
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would permit the Board of such No-Shop Party not to make a
Change in Company Recommendation or Change in Parent Recommendation, as
applicable; and

 

(iii) the Board of such No-Shop Party shall have considered all revisions to
the terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by the Other Party
and, at the end of the Fiduciary Notice Period, shall have determined in good
faith that a Change in Company Recommendation or a Change in Parent
Recommendation, as applicable, would nevertheless continue to be necessary in
order to comply with the fiduciary duties of its directors under applicable
Law even if such revisions were to be given effect.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.11_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit a No-Shop Party from taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of such No-Shop Party a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the stockholders of such No-
Shop Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such disclosure that addresses or relates to the approval,
recommendation or declaration of the advisability by the Board of such No-Shop
Party with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed a Change in Company Recommendation or a Change in Parent
Recommendation, as applicable, unless the Company Board or the Parent Board,
as applicable, in connection with such communication publicly states that its
recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to
the prior recommendation of the Company Board or the Parent Board, as
applicable.

(g) Each No-Shop Party and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
(other than the Other Party) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons (other
than the Other Party) who have been furnished

 



68  confidential information regarding such No-Shop Party in connection with the
solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12
months prior to the date of this Agreement promptly to return or destroy such
information. Except to the extent the Board of a No-Shop Party has concluded
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that that such action is necessary in order to comply with the
fiduciary duties of its directors under applicable Law, each No-Shop Party
agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any Third Party
from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which
such No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall
immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have
been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any Person to make
an Acquisition Proposal.

(h) Each No-Shop Party shall ensure that all Representatives of such No-Shop
Party and its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this
_Section 6.11_ as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.11_, any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.11_ by any
Representative of a No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries at the direction
or with the consent of such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.11_. 

Section 6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts (a) to take all actions necessary so
that no "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "anti-greenmail,"
"takeover," "interested stockholder" or similar Laws are or become applicable
to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (b) if any such Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to take all
actions necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Laws on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.13 _Reorganization Tax Matters_. None of the Company, Merger Sub or
Parent shall take or knowingly fail to take any action that is otherwise
consistent with the terms of this Agreement (without regard to this _Section
6.13_) and compliant with applicable Law that would cause the Merger to fail
to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning Section 368 of the Code.
Subject to applicable Tax Law and the receipt of the tax opinion letters
referenced in _Section 7.2(c)_ and _Section 7.3(c)_, each of the
Company, Merger Sub and Parent shall report the Merger as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

 

Section 6.14 _Certain Matters Relating to Parent_.

(a) _Parent Fiscal Year_. At or prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Parent shall change its fiscal year to year-end December 31st.

(b) _New Parent Bylaws_. At or prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, the bylaws of Parent shall be amended and restated
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _New Parent Bylaws_ ").

Joseph J. Romano as Chairman of Parent (the " _Chairman_ "); (B) Allan D.
Keel as President and Chief Executive Officer of Parent; and (C) E. Joseph
Grady as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Parent (the
persons in clauses (B) and (C) collectively, the " _Named Executive Officers_
"). If the Chairman or any of the Named Executive Officers is unable or
unwilling to hold the offices as set forth above, Parent and the Company shall
confer and mutually designate his successor. The authority, duties and
responsibilities of the Named Executive Officers shall be set forth in the
Executive Officer Employment Agreements, which Contracts shall also set forth
in their entirety the rights and remedies of the Named Executive Officers
with respect to employment or engagement by Parent.

(ii) On the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Named Executive Officers
have entered into employment agreements (the " _Executive Officer Employment
Agreements_ "). The effectiveness of the Executive Officer Employment

(d) _Parent Board Representation_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall take all requisite action to (i) cause the size of the Parent Board to
be eight directors and (ii) cause the directors of the Parent Board to be
comprised of (A) five directors selected by the Parent Board, which directors
shall be members of the existing Parent Board; and (B) three directors
selected by the Company Board, which directors shall be members of the
existing Company Board. In the event that, prior to the Effective Time, any
person so selected to serve on the Parent Board after the Effective Time is
unable or unwilling to serve in such position, the Board which selected such
person shall designate another of its members (or a non-member of such Board
if reasonably acceptable to the Parent Board) to serve in such persons stead
in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. For a
period of no less than one year from and after the Effective Time, the Parent
Board shall consist of five Parent Directors and three Company Directors; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, during such period, at least three of the
Parent Directors and at least two of the Company Directors shall be
independent for purposes of the rules of the NYSE. If, at any time during such
one year period, the number of Company Directors and Parent Directors
serving, or that would be serving following the next stockholders meeting at
which directors are to be elected, as directors of Parent, would not be as set
forth above, then, subject to the fiduciary duties of the directors of
Parent, the Parent Board (and any nominating committee thereof) shall appoint,
and nominate for election at the next stockholders meeting at which directors
are to be elected, such person or persons as may be requested by the
remaining Company Directors (if the number of Company Directors is, or would
otherwise become, less than three) or by the remaining Parent Directors (if
the number of Parent Directors is, or would otherwise become, less than five)
to ensure that there will be five Parent Directors and three Company
Directors.

(e) _Investment Committee_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent
Board shall create an investment committee of the Parent Board (the "
_Investment Committee_ ") which, among other things, shall be designated the
authority and power to allocate, subject to the approval of the entire Parent

Subsidiaries. The Investment Committee shall have two members, which shall,
effective as of the Effective Time, be initially comprised of Joseph J.
Romano and Allan D. Keel. Joseph J. Romano will serve as Chairman of the
Investment Committee.

(f) _Parent Name; Location_. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall (i)
retain its name and (ii) make the Surviving Corporations headquarters and
principal corporate offices in Houston, Texas the headquarters and principal
corporate offices of Parent.

 



70 Section 6.15 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to applicable Law, each of
Parent and the Company shall give the Other Party the opportunity to
participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against
such Party and its directors or executive officers relating to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party agrees
that, except to the extent permitted pursuant to _Section 5.2(o)_, such Party

(e) by the Parent Board if the Company has either (i) effected a Change in

such Party pays the applicable Termination Fee in accordance with _Section
8.3(b)_ or  _Section 8.3(d),_ none of such Party, its Affiliates or its or

referred to in this _Section 8.3(a)_ as the " _Applicable Party_ "); (ii)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (A) _Section 8.1(c)_ and
at the time of such termination the Applicable Party has not obtained such

 



75  Applicable Partys Stockholder Approval; (B) _Section 8.1(g)_ following

Transaction, then the Applicable Party shall on the date an Alternative
Transaction is consummated or any such definitive agreement is entered into,
pay the Other Party the applicable Termination Fee, less any Expense
Reimbursement Amount previously paid by such Applicable Party. " _Termination
Fee_ " means a fee equal to $7,000,000 if payable by the Company and a fee
equal to $28,000,000 if payable by Parent.

 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_, then the Company shall pay Parent, within three Business Days of the
date of such termination, the applicable Termination Fee. In the event this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_, then
Parent shall pay the Company, within three Business Days of the date of such
termination, the applicable Termination Fee.

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ as a result of a Willful and Material Breach by
the Other Party, then the breaching Party shall pay the Other Party the
Termination Fee within three Business Days of the date of such termination. 

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(h)_, then Parent shall pay the Company the applicable Termination Fee at
or prior to the time of such termination. In the event this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_, then the Company
shall pay Parent the applicable Termination Fee at or prior to the time of
such termination.

(e) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to (i) _Section 8.1(g)_ due to the failure to obtain the Parent
Stockholder Approval or (ii) _Section 8.1(c)_ and the Parent Stockholder
Approval shall not have been obtained prior to such termination, then Parent
shall pay, within three Business Days of the date of such termination, an
amount equal to $4,500,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement Amount_ ").

(f) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to (i) _Section 8.1(g)_ due to the failure to obtain Company
Stockholder Approval or (ii) _Section 8.1(c)_ and the Company Stockholder
Approval shall not have been obtained prior to such termination, then the
Company shall pay, within three Business Days of the date of such termination,
the Expense Reimbursement Amount.

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
if any Termination Fee becomes due and payable and the Company pays such
Termination Fee, none of the Company, its Affiliates or its or their
Representatives shall have any further liability of any kind for any reason in
connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby, except
as set forth in _Section 8.2_( _b)_ , _(c)_ or _(d)_ ; and (ii) if any
Termination Fee becomes due and payable and Parent pays such Termination Fee,
none of Parent, its Affiliates or its or their Representatives shall have any
further liability of any kind for any reason

 



76  in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby,
except as set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_, _(c)_ or _(d)_. For the avoidance
of doubt, under no circumstances shall any Party be required to pay more than
one Termination Fee or more than one Expense Reimbursement Amount.

 

(h) Any Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement Amount shall be paid by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by the Other Party in
writing in accordance with _Section 9.2_. Each Party acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, the Other Party would not enter into this Agreement. Each
Party further acknowledges and agrees that a Termination Fee is not a penalty,
but rather liquidated damages in amounts reasonably estimated by the Parties
to compensate the Other Party for efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Accordingly, if any Party fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Other Party commences an Action which results in an Order against
such first Party for a Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement Amount, the
Other Party shall pay to such first Party its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Action, together with
interest on any unpaid amount of the applicable Termination Fee or Expense
Reimbursement Amount at the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations plus
300 basis points in effect on the date such payment was required to be made,
calculated on a daily basis from the date the applicable Termination Fee or
Expense Reimbursement Amount were required to be paid until the date of the
actual payment.

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken or authorized by
their respective Board or managing member or sole member, as applicable, at
any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with
the Merger by the stockholders of the Company or Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company or Parent, there may not be,
without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement
that requires such further approval under applicable Law. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the Parties.

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board or managing
member or sole member, as applicable, may, subject to applicable Law, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the Other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the Other Party contained in this Agreement and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the Other Party
contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company and Parent, there may not be, without further approval of such
stockholders any extension or waiver of this Agreement that requires
such further approval under applicable Law. Any agreement on the part of a
Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent without the consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall
relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

Section 9.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. Each of the Parties

if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in
the federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to
any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts and agrees that it will not bring any legal action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment
in respect hereof in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the

as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment

 



80  in respect hereof, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that
(i) the Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner

on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy for any such breach. Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that
the agreements contained in this _Section 9.10_ are an integral part of the

ii BYLAWS

OF

CONTANGO ACQUISITION, INC.

 

ARTICLE I

 

 _Stockholders_

SECTION 1. _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation shall be held on such date, at such time and at such place within
or without the State of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of
Directors, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of
such other business as may be properly brought before the meeting. The Board
of Directors may determine that an annual meeting shall not be held at any
place, but shall instead be held solely by means of remote communication.

SECTION 2. _Special Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, a special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation may be called at any time by the Board of Directors. Any special
meeting of stockholders shall be held on such date, at such time and at such
place within or without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors shall
designate. The Board of Directors may determine that any special meeting of
stockholders shall not be held at any special place, but shall instead be held
solely by means of remote communication. At a special meeting of
stockholders, no business shall be transacted and no corporate action shall be
taken other than that stated in the notice of the meeting.

 

SECTION 3. _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, a written notice of each
meeting of the stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more
than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of the
Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting at the stockholders address as
it appears on the records of the Corporation or by a form of electronic
transmission to which the stockholder has consented. The notice shall state
the place, date and hour of the meeting or the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be
deemed to be present in person and may vote at such meeting, and in the case
of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.

 

SECTION 4. _Quorum_. At any meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority
in number of the total outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote at such meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum of the stockholders for all purposes, unless the
representation of a different number of shares shall be required by law, by
the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, in which case the
representation of the number of shares so required shall constitute a quorum.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, at any meeting of stockholders at which
the holders of any class of stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to
vote separately as a class, the holders of a majority in number of the total
outstanding shares of such class, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum for purposes of such class vote unless the
representation of a different number of shares of such class shall be required
by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws. SECTION 5. _Adjourned Meetings_. Whether or not a quorum shall be present in
person or represented at any meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the
meeting may adjourn such meeting from time to time. When a meeting is
adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned
meeting if the time and the place, if any, thereof, or the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed
to be present in person and may vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced
at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken or are publicly announced or
disclosed. At the adjourned meeting the stockholders or the holders of any
class of stock entitled to vote separately as a class, as the case may be, may
transact any business which might have been transacted by them at
the original meeting.

The Board of Directors may postpone any meeting of stockholders or cancel any
special meeting of stockholders by notice to the stockholders prior to the
time scheduled for the meeting.

SECTION 6. _Organization_. The Chief Executive Officer or, in the absence of
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board shall call all meetings
of the stockholders to order, and shall act as chairman of such meetings. In
the absence of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board, the
members of the Board of Directors who are present shall elect a chairman of
the meeting.

The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of
the stockholders; and in the absence of the Secretary, the chairman of the
meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. It shall be
the duty of the Secretary of the Corporation to prepare and make, at least
ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of stockholders
entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing
the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the
name of each stockholder.

SECTION 7. _Voting_. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote
for each share of the stock of the Corporation registered in the name of such
stockholder upon the books of the Corporation. Each stockholder entitled
to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons
to act for him or her by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon
after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. When directed by the presiding officer or upon the demand of any
stockholder, the vote upon any matter before a meeting of stockholders shall
be by ballot. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred
stock of the Corporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the
votes cast at a meeting of stockholders by the stockholders entitled to vote
in the election. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of
Incorporation, whenever any corporate action, other than the election of
directors, is to be taken at a meeting of stockholders, it shall be authorized
by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.

 

Shares of the stock of the Corporation belonging to the Corporation or to
another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the
election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or
indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be
counted for quorum purposes.

 



2 SECTION 8. _Voting Procedures and Inspectors_. The Corporation shall, in
advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of
election to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. Each
inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the duties of inspector,
shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector
with strict impartiality and according to the best of such persons ability.

The inspectors shall ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the
voting power of each; determine the shares represented at the meeting and the
validity of proxies and ballots; count all votes and ballots; determine and
retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges
made to any determination by them; and certify their determination of the
number of shares represented at the meeting, and their count of all votes and
ballots.

 

The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter
upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the
meeting. No ballots, proxies or votes, nor any revocations thereof or changes
thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls.

SECTION 9. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to be taken
or which may be taken at any meeting of holders of any class of stock of the
Corporation, or a series thereof, may be taken without a meeting, without
prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing (which may be a
telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission), setting forth
the action so taken, shall be dated and shall be signed by the holders of the
outstanding stock of such class, or the relevant series thereof, having not
less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted. To be written, signed and dated for the purpose of
these Bylaws, a telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission shall set
forth or be delivered with information from which the Corporation can
determine (i) that it was transmitted by a stockholder or proxy holder or a
person authorized to act for a stockholder or proxy holder, and (ii) the date
on which it was transmitted, such date being deemed the date on which the
consent was signed. Prompt notice of the taking of any corporate action
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to
those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

 

SECTION 10. _Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting or to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights, or to exercise any rights in
respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of
any other lawful action, as the case may be, the Board of Directors shall fix,
in advance, a record date, which shall not be (i) more than sixty (60) nor
less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, or (ii) in the case
of corporate action to be taken by consent in writing without a meeting, not
more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, or (iii) more than sixty
(60) days prior to any other action.

 



3 If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held; and the record date for determining
stockholders for any other purpose (except corporate action to be taken by
consent in writing) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however,
that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned
meeting. 

If a holder of record of any class of stock of the Corporation, or a series
thereof, the holders of which may act by a consent in writing, wishes to have
those stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent, such
stockholder shall, by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation,
request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors
shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which
such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no
record date is fixed by the Board within such ten (10) day period, the record
date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action,
when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law,
shall be the first date on which a signed consent setting forth the
action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation at its
registered office in the State of Delaware or to its principal place of
business to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation. Delivery made
to the registered office of the Corporation for this purpose shall be by hand
or by certified or registered mail with return receipt requested. If no record
date is so fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

 

ARTICLE II

 

 _Board of Directors_

SECTION 1. _Number and Term of Office_. The business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of
Directors, none of whom need be stockholders of the Corporation. The number
of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to
time by resolution passed by a majority of the Board of Directors. The
directors shall, except as hereinafter otherwise provided for
filling vacancies, be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders, and
shall hold office until their respective successors are elected and qualified
or until their earlier resignation or removal.

 

SECTION 2. _Removal, Vacancies and Additional Directors_. No director may be
removed except for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of all outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, considered for this purpose as a
single class. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, whenever any director
shall have been elected by the holders of any class of stock of the
Corporation voting separately as a class under the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation, such director may be removed and the vacancy
filled only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all
outstanding shares of that class of stock voting separately as a class. Except
as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies caused by any such
removal or any vacancy caused by the death or resignation of any director or
for any other reason, and any newly created

 



4  directorship resulting from any increase in the authorized number of
directors, may be filled by, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the
stockholders, and any director so elected to fill any such vacancy or newly
created directorship shall hold office until the directors successor is
elected and qualified or until the directors earlier resignation or
removal. 

When one or more directors shall resign effective at a future date, a majority
of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, or the
stockholders shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote
thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become
effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as herein provided
in connection with the filling of other vacancies.

SECTION 3. _Place of Meeting_. The Board of Directors may hold its meetings
in such place or places in the State of Delaware or outside the State of
Delaware as the Board from time to time shall determine.

SECTION 4. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors
shall be held at such times and places as the Board from time to time by
resolution shall determine. No notice shall be required for any regular

ARTICLE IV

_Indemnification_

 

SECTION 1. _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party
or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director of the Corporation or,
while a director of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter a
"Covered Person"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in
an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any
other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall
be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including, without
limitation,

 



9  attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Covered
Person in connection with such proceeding; provided, however, that, except as
provided in Section 3 of this Article IV with respect to proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify a Covered
Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
Covered Person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board of Directors.

SECTION 2. _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article IV, a Covered Person
shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees) incurred in defending,
testifying, or otherwise participating in any such proceeding in advance of
its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided,
however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") requires, an
advancement of expenses incurred by a Covered Person in his or her capacity as
a director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is rendered by such Covered Person, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon
delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"),
by or on behalf of such Covered Person, to repay all amounts so advanced if
it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there
is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such
Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this
Article IV or otherwise.

SECTION 3. _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section 1 or
2 of this Article IV is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days
after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, except in
the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case
the applicable period shall be 20 days, the Covered Person may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the Covered Person shall also be entitled to be
paid the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit
brought by the Covered Person to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder
(but not in a suit brought by a Covered Person to enforce a right to an
advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such
expenses upon a final adjudication that the Covered Person has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
suit that indemnification of the Covered Person is proper in the
circumstances because the Covered Person has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including a determination by its directors who are not parties to such
action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the Covered Person has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall create a presumption that the Covered Person has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
Covered Person, shall be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the
Covered Person to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement
of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that
the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement
of expenses, under this Article IV or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation.

 



10 SECTION 4. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights provided to Covered Persons
pursuant to this Article IV shall not be exclusive of any other right which
any Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, an agreement, a vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

SECTION 5. _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

SECTION 6. _Indemnification of Other Persons_. This Article IV shall not
limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner authorized
or permitted by law to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than
Covered Persons. Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation may, to the
extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of
the Corporation and to any other person who is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, to the fullest
extent of the provisions of this Article IV with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of Covered Persons under this
Article IV.

SECTION 7. _Amendments_. Any repeal or amendment of this Article IV by the
Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in
applicable law, or the adoption of any other provision of these Bylaws
inconsistent with this Article IV, will, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in
applicable law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights to Covered Persons on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto)
and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection
existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

SECTION 8. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Article IV, (a)
references to "other enterprise" shall include any employee benefit plan; (b)
references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with
respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) references to "serving at the
request of the Corporation" shall include any service that imposes duties on,
or involves services by, a person with respect to any employee benefit plan,
its participants, or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted in good faith
and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation"
for purposes of Section 145 of the DGCL.

 



11 SECTION 9. _Contract Rights_. The rights provided to Covered Persons pursuant
to this Article IV shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as
to a Covered Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, agent or
employee and shall inure to the benefit of the Covered Persons heirs,
executors and administrators. 

SECTION 10. _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this Article IV
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Article IV shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this
Article IV (including, without limitation, each such portion of this Article
IV containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable)
shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by
the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such
repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision with respect to
acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of
such inconsistent provision. NINTH: (a) Each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made
a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding") by reason of the fact that he or
she is or was a director of the Corporation or, while a director of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter a "Covered Person"), whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving
as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all
expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys fees,
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Covered Person in
connection with such proceeding, and such right to indemnification shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators; provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce
rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify a Covered Person in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Covered
Person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.
The right to indemnification conferred by this Section shall be a contract
right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses
incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition.

(b) The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Section Ninth shall not
be exclusive of any other rights which any Covered Person may have or
hereafter acquire under law, this Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

 

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section Ninth by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Certificate inconsistent with this Section Ninth, will, unless otherwise
required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or
change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto),
and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection
existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such
inconsistent provision in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(d) This Section Ninth shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons.

 



2 TENTH: Any action that is permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be effected
by written consent of the stockholders in lieu of a meeting of stockholders.

ELEVENTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this
Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary
way of this Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the
application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under
the provisions of section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers
appointed for this Corporation under the provisions of section 279 of Title 8
of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors,
and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as
the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a
majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or
class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of
this Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement
and to any reorganization of this Corporation as consequence of such
compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said
reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application
has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or
on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the
case may be, and also on this Corporation.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Crimson Exploration Inc. has caused this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by its President and Chief

STOCKHOLDERS

 

Section 2.1 Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation shall be held at such date, place and time as may be fixed by
resolution of the Board of Directors.

Section 2.2 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be
called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President and Chief
Executive Officer or a majority of the Board of Directors acting with or
without a meeting, or the holder or holders of one-half of all the
shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereat.

Section 2.3 Place of Meeting. The Board of Directors may designate the place
of meeting for any meeting of the stockholders. If no designation is made by
the Board of Directors, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of
the Corporation.

 

Section 2.4 Notice of Meeting. Written or printed notice, stating the place,
day and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting
is called, shall be prepared and delivered by the Corporation not less than
ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting,
either personally, or by mail, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote
at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when
deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon prepaid, addressed to
the stockholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of
the Corporation. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law.
Meetings may be held without notice if all stockholders

 



-1-   entitled to vote are present (except as otherwise provided by law), or if
notice is waived by those not present. Any previously scheduled meeting of the
stockholders may be postponed and (unless the Certificate of Incorporation
otherwise provides) any special meeting of the stockholders may be canceled,
by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the
time previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders. 

Section 2.5 Quorum and Adjournment. Except as otherwise provided by law or by
the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the voting
power of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote generally
in the election of directors (the "Voting Stock"), represented in person or by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders, except that
when specified business is to be voted on by a class or series voting
separately as a class or series, the holders of a majority of the voting power
of the shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of such business. The chairman of the meeting or a majority of the
shares of Voting Stock so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, whether or not there is such a quorum (or, in the case of specified
business to be voted on by a class or series, the chairman or a majority of
the shares of such class or series so represented may adjourn the meeting with
respect to such specified business). No notice of the time and place of
adjourned meetings need be given except as required by law. The stockholders
present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave
less than a quorum.

 

Section 2.6 Proxies. At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder may vote
by proxy executed in writing by the stockholder or as may be permitted by
law, or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. Such proxy must be filed with
the Secretary of the Corporation or his representative at or before the time
of the meeting.

 

Section 2.7 Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations.

 

(A) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_

(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the
Corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders
may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (a) pursuant to the
Corporations notice of meeting delivered pursuant to Section 2.4 of these
Bylaws, (b) by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board or the Board
of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is entitled to
vote at the meeting, who complied with the notice procedures set forth in
clauses (2) and (3) of this Section 2.7(A) and who was a stockholder of record
at the time such notice is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation.

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual
meeting by a stockholder pursuant Section 2.7(A)(1)(c) of these Bylaws, the
stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary
of the Corporation and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter
for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholders notice shall be
delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior
to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; _provided,
however,_ that in the event that the

 



-2-   date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than twenty (20) days, or
delayed by more than sixty (60) days, from such anniversary date, notice by
the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the
ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of
business on the later of the sixtieth day prior to such annual meeting or the
tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting
was mailed or public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.
Such stockholders notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all
information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in
solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or
is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and Rule
14a-11 thereunder, including such persons written consent to being named in
the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (b)
as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the
meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any
material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial
owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the
stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such
stockholder, as they appear on the Corporations books, and of such beneficial
owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are
owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial
owner. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an
annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders
notice as described above.

 

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 2.7(A)(2) of
these Bylaws to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be
elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is
no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying
the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation at least
seventy (70) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years
annual meeting, a stockholders notice required by this Section 2.7 shall also
be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions
created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the tenth day following the day such notice of the meeting
was mailed or on which such public announcement is first made by the
Corporation.

(B) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall be conducted
at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the
meeting pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting pursuant to Section
2.4 of these Bylaws. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of
Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors
are to be elected pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting (a) by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of the
Corporation who is entitled to vote at the meeting, who complies with the
notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.7 and who is a stockholder of
record at the time such notice is delivered to the Secretary of
the Corporation. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of
stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of
Directors, any such

 



-3-   stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for
election to such position(s) as are specified in the Corporations Notice of
Meeting, if the stockholders notice as required by Section 2.7(A)(2) of
these Bylaws shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation not earlier than the ninetieth day prior to such
special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
sixtieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day
such notice of the meeting was mailed or on which public announcement is first
made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the
Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public
announcement of an adjournment of a special meeting commence a new time period
for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

 

(C) _General_.

(1) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Bylaw shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business
shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought
before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
2.7. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to
determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before
the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 2.7 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in
compliance with this Section 2.7, to declare that such defective proposal or
nomination shall be disregarded.

(2) For purposes of this Section 2.7, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.7, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in this Section 2.7. Nothing in this Section 2.7 shall be deemed to
affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the
Corporations proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 2.8 Procedure for Election of Directors. Election of directors at all
meetings of the stockholders at which directors are to be elected shall be by
written ballot, and, except as otherwise set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation with respect to the right of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock or any other series or class of stock to elect
additional directors under specified circumstances, an affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast thereat shall elect directors. Except as otherwise
provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all other
matters submitted to the stockholders at any meeting shall be decided by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Voting
Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to
vote thereon.

 



-4-  Section 2.9 Inspectors of Elections; Opening and Closing the Polls.

 

(A) The Board of Directors by resolution shall appoint one or more inspectors,
which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the
Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers,
employees, agents or representatives of the Corporation, to act at the meeting
and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be designated
as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no
inspector or alternate has been appointed to act, or if all inspectors or
alternates who have been appointed are unable to act, at a meeting of
stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or
her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 

(B) The chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the date
and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon
which the stockholders will vote at a meeting.

Section 2.10 No Action Without Annual or Special Meeting. Subject to the
rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock or any other series or
class of stock as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation with respect
to such series or class, any action required or permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to be taken by the stockholders of
the Corporation must be effected at an annual or special meeting of the
stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a
meeting by such stockholders.

ARTICLE III

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Section 3.1 General Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. In addition to
the powers and authorities by these Bylaws expressly conferred upon them, the
Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all
such lawful acts and things as are not by law, by the Certificate of
Incorporation or by these Bylaws required to be exercised or done by the
stockholders.

 

Section 3.2 Number, Tenure and Qualifications. The number of directors of the
Corporation shall be at least three (3) and not more than eight (8). Subject
to the foregoing limitations and subject to Section 3.8, without amendment of
these Bylaws, the number of directors may be fixed or changed by resolution
adopted by the vote of the majority of directors in office or by the vote of
holders of shares representing a majority of the voting power at any annual
meeting, or any special meeting called for that purpose; but no reduction of
the number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior
to the expiration of his term of office. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 3.2, the Board of Directors shall take all requisite
action to cause the Board of Directors to be comprised of the
following directors as of the Effective Time:

 



-5-  (A) five (5) persons identified by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
at or prior to the Effective Time to serve on the Board of Directors after
the Effective Time (such members, the "Contango Directors"); and

(B) Allan D. Keel, B. James Ford and Lon McCain (such members, the "Crimson
Directors").

 

Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
shall take all requisite action to cause the Board of Directors to be
comprised of the five Contango Directors and the three Crimson Directors;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, during such period, at least three of the
Contango Directors and at least two of the Crimson Directors shall be
independent for purposes of the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. If, at
any time until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the number of
Crimson Directors and Contango Directors serving, or that would be serving
following the next stockholders meeting at which directors are to be
elected, as directors of the Corporation, would not be as set forth above,
then, subject to the fiduciary duties of the directors of the Corporation, the
Board of Directors (and any nominating committee thereof) shall appoint, and
nominate for election at the next stockholders meeting at which directors are
to be elected, such person or persons as may be requested by the remaining
Crimson Directors (if the number of Crimson Directors is, or would otherwise
become, less than three) (and such person or persons, "Crimson Directors") or
by the remaining Contango Directors (if the number of Contango Directors is,
or would otherwise become, less than five) (and such person or persons,
"Contango Directors") to ensure that there will be five Contango Directors
and three Crimson Directors.

For purposes of these Bylaws, the "Effective Time" means the date and time of
the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the
Certificate of Merger consummating the merger of Contango Acquisition, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, with and
into Crimson, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated as of April [], 2013, among the Corporation, Crimson and
Contango Acquisition, Inc.

Section 3.3 Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the Board of Directors
shall be held without notice other than this Bylaw immediately after, and at
the same place as, each annual meeting of stockholders. The Board of Directors
may, by resolution, provide the time and place for the holding of additional
regular meetings without notice other than such resolution.

Section 3.4 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall
be called at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the President and
Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the Board of Directors. The person or
persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix
the place and time of the meetings.

Section 3.5 Notice. Notice of any special meeting shall be given to each
director at his business or residence in writing or by telephone
communication. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed adequately delivered
when deposited in the United States mails so addressed, with postage thereon
prepaid, at least five days before such meeting. If by facsimile
transmission, such notice shall be transmitted at least twenty-four hours
before such meeting. If by telephone,

 



-6-   the notice shall be given at least twelve hours prior to the time set for
the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the
notice of such meeting, except for amendments to these Bylaws as provided
under Section 8.1 of Article VIII hereof. A meeting may be held at any time
without notice if all the directors are present (except as otherwise provided
by law) or if those not present waive notice of the meeting in writing, either
before or after such meeting.

Section 3.6 Conference Telephone Meetings. Members of the Board of Directors,
or any committee thereof, may participate in a meeting of the Board of
Directors or such committee by means of conference telephone or similar
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

 

Section 3.7 Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be
taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee thereof may be
taken without a meeting if, before or after the action, a written consent

the committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not
disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the
meeting in place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such
committee, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent provided in the
resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the
powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the
business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of
the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.

other things, shall be designated the authority and power to allocate, subject

member of the Investment Committee, or modification of the authority of the
Investment Committee, shall be subject to Section 3.8.

designated by the Board of Directors may make, alter and repeal rules for the

conduct its business in the same manner as the Board of Directors conducts its
business pursuant to these Bylaws.

 

Section 3.11 Removal. Any director may be removed without cause at any special
meeting of shareholders called for such purpose by the vote of the holders of

of any such removal, a new director may be elected at the same meeting for
the unexpired term of each director removed. Failure to elect a director to
fulfill the unexpired term of any director removed shall be deemed to create a
vacancy in the Board of Directors. The terms of this Section 3.11 are subject
to any contractual provisions binding on the Corporation from time to time,
and such contractual provisions shall control to the extent they conflict with
the terms hereof.

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 6.1 Right to Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently
exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (an "Indemnitee") who was or
is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he, or a person
for whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of
the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust,
enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses
(including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.3, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an Indemnitee in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnitee
only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the
Indemnitee was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

 

Section 6.2 Prepayment of Expenses. The Corporation shall pay the expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition, _provided_ , _however_ , that,
to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the
final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking by the Indemnitee to repay all amounts advanced if it should be
ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
under this Article VI or otherwise.

 

Section 6.3 Claims. If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses
under this Article VI is not paid in full within sixty days after a written
claim therefor by the Indemnitee has been received by the Corporation, the
Indemnitee may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of
prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the
burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to the requested
indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.

 

Section 6.4 Nonexclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any Indemnitee
by this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such
Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

Section 6.5 Other Sources. The Corporations obligation, if any, to indemnify
or to advance expenses to any Indemnitee who was or is serving at its request
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any
amount such Indemnitee may collect as indemnification or advancement of
expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
enterprise or nonprofit enterprise.

 



-12-  Section 6.6 Amendment or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the
foregoing provisions of this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right
or protection hereunder of any Indemnitee in respect of any act or omission
occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

 

Section 6.7 Other Indemnification and Prepayment of Expenses. This Article VI
shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than
Indemnitees when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.

Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the President and Chief
Executive Officer or any Vice President may from time to time appoint an
