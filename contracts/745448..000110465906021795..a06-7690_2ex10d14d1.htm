(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the Buyer agrees to pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers an aggregate of
$79,200,000, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.5 (the " _Purchase Price_ "),

market account. The interest on the Deposit will be paid to the party to this
Agreement that receives the Deposit. In the event of a dispute between the

the Sellers, the Buyer or into the court.

Sellers and the Buyer, the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a statement of
Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Net Working

Sellers Accountants thereon to the effect that such statement fairly

of (a) net total Inventory, total prepaids, and unbilled tooling of the
Business, excluding cash and cash equivalents and intercompany receivables,
minus (b) the sum of net Trade Accounts Payable and other accrued expenses of
the Business, all of which are presented on line items shown in Section

the Closing Net Working Capital Statement shall be prepared applying the
accounting principles and policies to be reasonably agreed by the Buyer and
Sellers within 16 days after the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Net Working Capital Principles_ ").

  



  

(b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows: subject to Section
2.5(d), (i) if Net Working Capital on the Closing Date as reflected on the
Closing Net Working Capital Statement is less than $3,500,000 (the " _Target
Net Working Capital_ "), the difference between Net Working Capital and the
Target Net Working Capital shall be paid by the Sellers to the Buyer or (ii)
if Net Working Capital on the Closing Date as reflected on the Net Working
Capital Statement is more than the Target Net Working Capital, the difference

that the Buyer shall notify the Sellers in writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ")
of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 60 days of
the Sellers delivery of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement. In
the event of such a dispute, the Sellers and the Buyer shall attempt to
reconcile their differences and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive. If the Sellers and the Buyer
are unable to reach a resolution with such effect within 30 days of the
receipt by the Sellers of the Dispute Notice, the Sellers and the Buyer shall
submit the accounting treatment in accordance with the Net Working Capital
Principles of the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the
Independent Accounting Firm, which shall, within 30 days after submission,
determine and report to the parties upon such remaining disputed items, and
such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on the

  



        
   

  



  

parties hereto. All costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
relating to the disputed items shall be allocated between the Sellers and the
Buyer in the same proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the items
unsuccessfully disputed by each party bears to the total dollar amount of the
items disputed hereunder. The term " _Independent Accounting Firm_ " shall
mean a nationally recognized accounting firm which is not otherwise retained
by the Sellers or Buyer and their respective Affiliates as the Sellers and
the Buyer shall agree.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any dispute pursuant to Section 2.5(d) of any amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 2.5, the applicable party shall at the time
specified in this Section 2.5 pay the net amount payable by it pursuant to
this Section 2.5 that is not subject to any dispute. Any amount payable
following resolution of a matter specified in a Dispute Notice shall be paid
within five Business Days following the resolution thereof.

  



  

(f) During the periods in which (i) the Closing Net Working Capital Statement
is being prepared or (ii) any dispute is raised as contemplated by Section
2.5(d), the Sellers and the Buyer shall provide each other, including their
authorized agents and Representatives, with reasonable access, during normal

combined, unitary or similar Tax Returns of the Sellers (or any Subsidiary of
the Sellers), the Buyer shall only have access to portions of such Tax
Returns relevant to the Business and _provided_ _further_ ,  _however_ , that
any access to accountants work papers shall be subject to the policies and
requirements of such accounting firm.

constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any instrument, contract, lease
or other agreement or arrangement or any claim, right or benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom if an assignment or transfer or an attempt
to make such an assignment or transfer without the consent of a third party
would constitute a breach or violation thereof or adversely affect the rights
of the Buyer or the Sellers thereunder; and any transfer or assignment to the
Buyer by the Sellers of any interest under any such instrument, contract,
lease or other agreement or arrangement that requires the consent or approval
of a third party shall be made subject to such consent or approval being

any and all rights of the Sellers against a third party

approval of the assignment of such instrument, contract, lease or other
agreement or arrangement is obtained, the Sellers shall promptly assign,
transfer, convey and deliver such instrument, contract, lease or other
agreement or arrangement, and the Buyer shall assume the obligations
thereunder from and after the date of assignment to the Buyer pursuant to a
special-purpose assignment and assumption agreement substantially similar in
terms to those of the Assumption Agreement (which special-purpose agreement
the parties shall prepare, execute and deliver in good faith at the time of
such transfer, all at no additional cost to the Buyer or the Seller).

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in the next sentence, in no event will the Sellers be
required to alter the terms of any agreement or pay any fee in connection
with obtaining such consent or approval, unless such consent or transfer fee
is provided for in such instrument, contract, lease or other agreement or
arrangement as in effect on the date hereof, in which case the Sellers shall
be required to pay such fee in connection therewith (to the extent required
by the party entitled thereto). With respect to the leases of

  



        
   

  



  

Real Property used in the Business listed or described in Section 2.8(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Sellers shall be required to obtain such

obtaining any consent or approval required for the assignment of any Contract

agreements listed in Section 6.1.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter ("Assumed

Date immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby
(each such Employee who accepts such offer, together with Employees
represented by a labor organization as provided at Section 6.1.2 above, being

and 6.1.2 shall not be construed to limit the ability of the Buyer to
terminate any such Employee at any time for any reason after the Closing Date
except as otherwise prohibited by law, or subject to the terms and conditions
of any Assumed Collective Bargaining Agreement, and (ii) the Buyer shall not
be obligated to provide any benefits that are comparable to any stock based
benefits or any defined benefit pension plan benefits, except in connection
with Assumed Collective Bargaining Agreements. From and after the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall also assume responsibility to provide
Transferred Employees with disability benefits in the same manner and to the
same extent as such Transferred Employees would have been entitled to receive
under the Sellers disability plans and the Buyer shall assume the
responsibility to provide Transferred Employees with continuing benefits and
coverage required, if any, under section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of

not be prohibited from amending or terminating any benefit or compensation
plan, program, practice, policy, agreement or arrangement covering any
Transferred Employee (subject to any applicable terms and conditions of any

Buyer shall be solely responsible for any and all liabilities, obligations
and responsiblities in respect of the Transferred Employees, and their
beneficiaries and dependents, relating to or arising in connection with or
as a result of (i) the employment or the actual or constructive termination
of employment of any such Transferred Employee by the Sellers (including,
without limitation, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) the participation in or accrual
of benefits or compensation under, or the failure to participate in or to
accruecompensation or benefits under, any Plan (other than any stock based
Plan or any Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan) or other employee
or retiree benefit or compensation plan, program, practice, policy, agreement
or arrangement of the Sellers or (iii) accrued but unpaid salaries, wages,
bonuses, incentive compensation, vacation or sick pay or other compensation or
payroll items (including, without limitation, deferred compensation), except,
in any such case, to the extent any such liability, obligation or
responsibility (x) is specifically retained by the Sellers pursuant to this
Article VI or (y) relates to services rendered and arose prior to the Closing
Date and is not reflected on the Closing Net Working Capital Statement in a
manner consistent with the prior practice of the Sellers. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, the Sellers shall retain all
liability for defined benefit pension benefits accrued by Transferred
Employees as of the Closing Date, and shall retain all responsibility and
liability arising out of or relating to the Metaldyne Corporation Pension
Plan (MascoTech) (the " _Seller Pension Plan_ "). On or as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall establish a defined
benefit pension plan (the " _Buyer Pension Plan_ ") to provide for such
defined benefit pension benefits as are required to be provided to
Transferred Employees from and after the Closing Date pursuant to any Assumed

credited under the Seller Pension Plan for purposes of eligibility,

with respect to any Transferred Employee under the Buyer Pension Plan shall
be reduced by the benefit accrued with respect to such Transferred Employee

Notification_ _Act (WARN)_. The Buyer shall not, during the sixty (60) day
period after the Closing Date, change the terms and conditions of the
employment of the Transferred Employees such that such changes would result

law known as the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (" _WARN_
"). Except as to this condition, the parties agree that the Sellers shall be
responsible for any required WARN notices under WARN up until the date and
time of Closing and the Buyer for WARN notices after the date and time of
Closing. If and when such notice is required for Transferred Employees at any
time (if ever) due to actions or inactions of the Buyer but is not given, the
Buyer shall be responsible to indemnify the Sellers for the Sellers portion
of any pay in lieu of notice required under WARN to be paid by the Sellers.

(a) The Sellers shall retain liability for all suits, claims, proceedings and
actions pending as of or commenced after the Closing Date resulting from
actual or alleged harm or injury to Transferred Employees where the incident
or accident giving rise to such liability occurred prior to the Closing Date.
The Buyer shall assume liability for all suits, claims, proceedings and
actions commencedby or on behalf of a Transferred Employee on or after the
Closing Date where the incident or accident giving rise to such liability
occurs on or after the Closing Date. The Buyer shall make all necessary
arrangements to provide workers compensation insurance and cover claims for
Transferred Employees arising on or after the Closing Date and to ensure the
management of such claims.

  



  

(b) Buyer will offer to hire any Employee at a wage and benefits package that
would meet the requirements of Section 6.1.3 who is on workers compensation

met (i) the employee is able to return to work, and (ii) there is a position
with the Buyer that the Employee can fill for which the Employee is
reasonably qualified and for which the Employeecan perform the
essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation. In the case of
Employeeswho are on workers compensation leave at an Acquired Facility but
whom are covered by a Assumed Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Buyer will
hire such Employees as of the Closing Date and provide such leave manner and
reinstatement in the manner provided by the Assumed Collective Bargaining
Agreement. In either case, effective upon being hired, such Employees shall
be deemed to be a Transferred Employee for purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 6.2(b)
shall not be construed to limit the ability of the Buyer to terminate any
such Employee at any time for any reason after the Closing Date except as
otherwise prohibited by law, or subject to the terms and conditions of any
Assumed Collective Bargaining Agreement.

(the " _Seller Welfare Plans_ ") shall be cut off and terminated as of the
Closing Date, _provided_ that the Sellers shall remain liable for all
claims incurred and made by Covered Employees prior to the Closing Date that
remain unpaid as of the

  



        
   

  



  

Closing Date. Subject to the satisfaction of any conditions, limitations or

benefits to such Covered Employees (and the eligible dependents of such
Covered Employees) in substantially the same manner as provided by the
Sellers prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer Welfare Plans shall be liable

Seller Welfare Plans in the plan fiscal year ending December 31, 2005 to the
deductibles and out of pocket maximums under the Buyer Welfare Plans, if any,
for the plan fiscal year which ends on December 31, 2005. If requested by the
Buyer, the Sellers shall furnish the Buyer with a schedule within a
reasonable period of time following the Closing Date setting forth
the deductibles and out of pocket maximums incurred under the Seller Welfare
Plans for each Covered Employee. The Seller Welfare Plans shall be liable
only for claims incurred and actually made prior to the Closing Date. The

Sellers be furnished with additional information relating to the Business and

its reasonable efforts to furnish, or cause to be furnished, such
information to the party requesting information. Notwithstanding the above,
to the extent that the Buyer or the Sellers are unable to, with reasonably
diligent effort and at reasonable expense, perform their obligations in the
manner contemplated by this Article VI, the Buyer and the Sellers shall
cooperate in order to achieve the most economic transfer reasonably
practicable and the Buyer on the one hand and the Sellers on the other agree

to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder, all corporate and stockholder action necessary therefor has been

agreement or instrument to which the Guarantor is a party, or its certificate
of limited partnership or its limited partnership agreement, and this

affecting creditors rights generally).

employees, agents, advisers and representatives of each such
Person (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and pay
or reimburse the _Buyer_ _Indemnitees_ for any and all claims, liabilities,
obligations, Taxes, losses, fines, royalties, proceedings, deficiencies or
damages (whether absolute, accrued, conditional or otherwise and whether or

accountants fees incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same
or in asserting any of their respective rights hereunder (collectively, "
_Losses_ "), resulting from or arising out of:

  



  

(i) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by any Seller in
(A) this Agreement, (B) the Company Disclosure Letter, (C) any transfer
instrument, (D) the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.2.1(d), (E)
all instruments and other documents effecting the transfer of Assets or the
assumption of Assumed Liabilities pursuant to this Agreement or (F) the Trade
Accounts Payable Statement;

  



  

(ii) any failure of either Seller to perform any covenant or agreement set
forth herein;

  



  

(iii) any Excluded Assets;

  



  

(iv) any Retained Liabilities (including, without limitation, the failure
to pay any Retained Liabilities), except to the extent that such liability is
an Assumed Liability;

  



  

(v) any and all Benefit Liabilities in respect of Employees except,
with respect to Employees and Transferred Employees, to the extent assumed by
the Buyer pursuant to Article VI; and

  



  

(vi) any claim set forth in Section 9.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  



  

Sellers shall have no obligation to defend, indemnify or hold harmless the
Buyer with respect to any Environmental Liability if any such liability
relates to, arises out of or is triggered by any condition that is discovered
or identified as a result of any investigation, testing or sampling conducted
by or on behalf of the Buyer after the Closing, except for any such action as
is required by law, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this limitation shall not
apply to (x) any investigation, testing or sampling conducted pursuant to
Section 4.3 hereof; (y) any investigation, testing or sampling required in
connection with the financing of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including without limitation the proposed sale-leaseback of the Owned Real
Property located in Troy and Royal Oak, Michigan); or (z) any condition that
is discovered or identified incidentally in connection with capital
improvements initiated by the Buyer in the ordinary course of business. Any
Environmental Liability or condition requiring indemnification or remediation
by Sellers under the terms of this Agreement shall be indemnified or
remediated only to the extent required by Environmental Laws for industrial
use of the Real Property to be remediated (including the use of reasonable
engineering and/or institutional controls, use restrictions and covenants).
The Seller shall control all remediation required of Seller under the terms
of this Agreement and all negotiations with any Governmental Authority with
respect to such remediation, provided that the Buyer shall be given
reasonable notice of and have the right to attend all meetings between any
Governmental Authority and Sellers and/or their consultant and, and
further provided that neither Sellers remediation activities, nor any
actions or restrictions agreed to with any Governmental Authority shall
unreasonably interfere with Buyers current or future use of the applicable
site for industrial purposes.

  



  

Except for indemnification claims arising from inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3,
3.1.6, 3.1.10 (insofar as it relates to title to Assets with an acquired
value or original asset cost, as shown in Section 1.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, in excess of $10,000) or 3.1.22, the Sellers shall not be
required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to any
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i)(F)) unless and until
the aggregate amount of all claims against the Sellers under such Section
9.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.2(a)(i)(F)) exceeds $1,000,000 and then only to the extent such
aggregate amount

  



        
   

  



  

exceeds $1,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the
Sellers aggregate liability for claims under such 
 Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i)(F)) exceed 20% of the Purchase Price paid on
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to inaccuracies
in the representation and warranties contained in Section 3.1.1, 3.1.2,
3.1.3, 3.1.6, 3.1.10 (insofar as it relates to title to Assets with
an acquired value or original asset cost, as shown in Section 1.1(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, in excess of $10,000) or 3.1.22, the
Sellers aggregate liability for claims shall not exceed the Purchase Price
paid on the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) _By the Buyer_. The Buyer covenants and agrees to defend, indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers, their respective Affiliates and the officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisers and representatives of each such
Person (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and
all Losses resulting from or arising out of:

  



  

(i) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by any Buyer in (A)
this Agreement, (B) the Buyer Disclosure Letter, (C) any transfer instrument
or (D) the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.3.1(c);

  



  

(ii) any failure of the Buyer to perform any covenant or agreement set forth
herein;

  



  

(iii) the Assumed Liabilities;

  



  

(iv) the use by the Buyer of any of the Sellers trade names or
trademarks after the Closing Date as contemplated by Section 4.2.4; and

  



  

(v) the operation of the Business or the ownership, operation or use of
the Assets following the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) _Adjustments to Indemnification Payments_. Any payment made by the Sellers
to the Buyer Indemnitees, on the one hand, or by the Buyer to the Seller
Indemnitees, on the other hand, pursuant to this Section 9.2 in respect of
any claim shall be net of any insurance proceeds realized by and paid to the
Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. The Indemnified Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to make insurance claims relating to any
claim for which it is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.2.
The amount of any Loss under Section 9.2(a) or 9.2(b) shall be reduced by
the actual federal, state and other income or similar tax savings realized by
the Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, with
respect thereto.

  



  

(d) _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. All indemnification payments made under
this Section 9.2 shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price.

  



  

(e) _Indemnification Procedures_. In the case of any claim asserted by
a third party against a party entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party"), notice shall be given by the
Indemnified Party to the party required to provide indemnification (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and the
Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such
Indemnifying Party) to assume the defense of any claim or any litigation
resulting therefrom, _provided_  that (i) the counsel for the Indemnifying
Party who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party
may participate in such defense at such Indemnified Partys expense, and
(iii) the omission by any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation
under this Agreement except to the extent that such omission results in a
failure of actual notice to the Indemnifying

  



        
   

  



  

Party and such Indemnifying Party is damaged as a result of such failure to
give notice. Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, no Indemnifying
Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall consent to entry
of any judgment or order, interim or otherwise, or enter into any settlement
that provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the
Indemnified Party or that does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a
release from all liability with respect to such claim or litigation. In the
event that the Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that the
conduct of the defense of any claim subject to indemnification hereunder or
any proposed settlement of any such claim by the Indemnifying Party might be
expected to affect adversely the Indemnified Partys liability for Taxes or
the ability of the Indemnified Party to conduct its business, or that the
Indemnified Party may have available to it one or more defenses or
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim or any
litigation relating thereto, the Indemnified Party shall have the right at
all times to take over and assume control over the defense, settlement,
negotiations or litigation relating to any such claim at the sole cost of the
Indemnifying Party, _provided_ that if the Indemnified Party does so take
over and assume control, the Indemnified Party shall not settle such claim or
litigation without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that
the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any matter as
above provided, the Indemnified Party shall have the full right to defend
against any such claim or demand and shall be entitled to settle or agree to
pay in full such claim or demand. In any event, the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense of any claim or
litigation subject to this Section 9.2 and the records of each shall be
available to the other with respect to such defense.

  



  

(f) _Limitations_. The obligation of the Sellers to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees pursuant to 
 Section 9.2(a)(i) shall terminate when the applicable representation or
warranty terminates pursuant to Section 9.3; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any indemnification obligation of the Sellers that would otherwise terminate
in accordance with this provision shall not terminate if a claim by a Buyer
Indemnitee shall have been timely made or given on or prior to the applicable
terminate date, and shall continue in full force and effect (solely with
respect to any such claim) until such claim has been satisfied or
otherwise resolved under this Article IX. To the extent any provision of
this Agreement specifically limits or excludes the Sellers
indemnification obligation for certain matters, the Sellers shall have no
indemnification obligation for such matters under any other provisions of
this Agreement.

  



  

9.3. _Survival of Representations and Warranties, etc_. The representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, any examination by or on behalf of the parties
hereto and the completion of the transactions contemplated herein, but only

any event, not later than June 30, 2007);

  



  

(b) the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1.1,
3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.10 (insofar as it relates to title to Assets with an
acquired value or original asset cost, as shown in Section 1.1(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, in excess of $10,000), 3.1.22, 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and
3.2.4 shall survive without limitation;

  



  

(c) the representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in Section
3.1.6 shall survive for a period of 60 days following the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations (as

  



        
   

  



  

extended for any reason, including without limitation by reason of waiver of
such statute of limitations);

  



  

(d) the representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in Section
3.1.16 shall survive until sixty (60) days after the receipt by the Buyer of
audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 2006 (but in
any event no later than June 30, 2007), _provided_ that if any claim
is brought by the Guarantor, the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates under indemnifications obligations of the Buyer under Section
3.1(c) of the supply agreement (entered into pursuant to Section 5.2.3(b)
or any transferee of their respective rights under such agreement), and such
claim is based in whole or in part on facts or circumstances which
would otherwise constitute a breach of the representations and warranties of
the Sellers contained in Section 3.1.16, such representations and warranties
of the Sellers in Section 3.1.16 shall be deemed to survive until
final determination of any such claims under the Supply Agreement; and

  



  

(e) the representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in Section
3.1.19 shall survive for a period of 36 months following the Closing Date.

  



  

9.4. _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification provisions in this Agreement
shall be the exclusive remedy available to the Buyer Indemnitees or the
Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, for any breach of
the representations, warranties, covenants or other provisions or this
Agreement, other than (i) equitable remedies (included, but not limited
to, injunctive relief and specific performance) and (ii) remedies for
fraud. No party shall be entitled to the indemnification provided for
hereunder if it had knowledge at any time of the matter that is later the
subject of a claim for indemnity.

  



  

9.5. _No Special Damages_. In no event shall any party be liable under this
Section IX or otherwise in respect of this Agreement for exemplary, special,
punitive, indirect, remote or speculative damages except to the extent any
such party suffers such damages to an unaffiliated third party in
connection with a third party claim, in which event such damages shall be
recoverable.

  



  

9.6. _Expenses_. The Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other
hand, shall bear their respective expenses, costs and fees (including
attorneys, auditors and financing commitment fees) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and compliance herewith (the " _Transaction
Expenses_ "), whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated.

  



  

9.7. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, including any
phrase, sentence, clause, section or subsection, is inoperative or
unenforceable for any reason, such circumstances shall not have the effect of
rendering the provision in question inoperative or unenforceable in any other
case or circumstance, or of rendering any other provision or
provisions herein contained invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to any
extent whatsoever.

  



  

9.8. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, waivers and other
communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall

this Agreement.

  



  

9.9.2. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure

9.9.4. _Governing Law, etc_. This Agreement shall be governed in
all respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the
internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflict
of laws rules thereof. Except as provided by Section 2.5(d) of this
Agreement, any dispute or disputes arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including but not limited to indemnification under, or the breach,
termination or validity thereof (" _Dispute_ "), shall be finally resolved by
arbitration in accordance with the International Institute for Conflict
Prevention and Resolution (" _CPR_ ") Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration
then in effect (the " _Rules_ "), as set forth in this paragraph. If a
Dispute arises, and if the Dispute cannot be settled through direct
discussions between representatives of the Sellers and Guarantor and
representatives of the Buyer within thirty calendar days following receipt of
notice of a Dispute, the parties agree first to endeavor to settle the
Dispute in an amicable manner by mediation under the Mediation Procedure
established by the CPR, then in effect, before resorting to arbitration. If a
Dispute cannot be resolved through such mediation process within thirty
calendar days following the appointment of the mediator, the Dispute will be
settled finally by arbitration under the Rules, by a sole arbitrator, chosen
by agreement of the parties within twenty calendar days of the receipt by a
party of a copy of the notice of arbitration from the other party. In the
event the parties cannot reach such agreement within such twenty calendar day
period, the arbitrator shall be appointed by the CPR in accordance with the
Rules. Any arbitrator appointed by CPR shall be a retired judge or a
practicing attorney with no less than fifteen years of experience with large
commercial cases and an experienced arbitrator. The arbitration will be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 _et_ _seq_. The parties
shall be entitled to conduct limited discovery, consisting only of (i)
production by the parties of documents relevant to the claims and defenses of
any party and (ii) five single days deposition conducted by the Buyer and two
single days deposition conducted by the Sellers and Guarantor. The
arbitration hearing on the merits shall be held no later than four months
after the appointment of the arbitrator unless the parties otherwise agree or
the arbitrator extends such time period for good cause shown. The arbitrator
shall not be empowered to award damages in excess of compensatory damages and
each party expressly waives and forgoes any claim or right to punitive,
exemplary or similar damages unless a statute requires that compensatory
damages be increased in a specified manner. The award shall be in writing and
shall state the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which it is based.
The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and
judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced

  



        
   

  



  

in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Buyer, the Sellers and the
Guarantor hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the
State of New York and the Federal courts of the United States of America
located in the State, City and County of New York, and hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
enforcement of such judgment or award, that it is not subject thereto or that
such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in
said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this
Agreement or any of such document may not be enforced in or by said courts.
The Buyer, the Sellers and the Guarantor hereby consent to and grant any such
court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 9.7, or in such other manner as may be
permitted by law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. Unless the
parties otherwise agree in writing, the mediation and arbitration will be
held in New York, New York. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses
(including fees and disbursements of counsel) and the Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Sellers and the Guarantor, on the other hand, shall each bear one-
half of the costs and expenses payable to the mediator and arbitrator.

  



  

9.9.5. _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and
permitted assigns.

  



  

9.9.6. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable or otherwise
transferable by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the
other party hereto, _provided_  that the Buyer may assign this Agreement (a)
to any Affiliate of the Buyer, (b) as security for any obligation arising in
connection with the financing of the transactions contemplated hereby or (c)
subsequent to the Closing, to any transferee of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Business that executes a written assumption of the
obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements.
At the request of the Buyer, the Sellers shall execute customary consents to
collateral assignment documents with the Buyers lenders in connection with
any assignments permitted by Section 9.9.6(b).

  



  

9.9.7. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 9.2
with respect to indemnification of Indemnified Parties hereunder, nothing in
this Agreement shall confer any rights upon any Person or entity other than
the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and permitted
assigns.

  



  

9.9.8. _Amendment; Waivers, etc_. No amendment, modification or discharge
of this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless
set forth in writing and duly executed by the party against whom enforcement
of the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought. Any such
waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party
granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the
waiver by any of the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of
the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on
one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or
to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver
of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of
such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies
herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity. The rights
and remedies of any party based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect
of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement or failure to fulfill any condition shall in no way be limited by
the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of facts upon
which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach is based may also be the
subject matter of any other representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach. The representations and
warranties of the Sellers and the Guarantor shall not be affected or deemed
waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Buyer
(including but not limited to by any of its advisors, consultants or
representatives)

  



        
   

  



  

or by reason of the fact that the Buyer or any of such advisors, consultants
or representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is or might be inaccurate.

  



  

9.9.9. _Sellers  Obligations_. The liability of the Sellers hereunder shall
be joint and several. Where in this Agreement provision is made for
any action to be taken or not taken by either Seller, Sellers jointly and
severally undertake to cause such Seller to take or not take such action, as
the case may be.

 **Exhibit C**

  



  

(a) Metaldyne Corporation (the " _Company_ ") hereby assigns, transfers and
sets over (collectively the " _Assignment_ ") to Assignee, from and after the
Closing Date, all of the Companys right, title, benefit, privileges and
interest in and to, and all of the Companys burdens, obligations and
liabilities arising from and after the Closing Date, under and pursuant to
the Asset Purchase Agreement, by and between Forming Technologies, Inc., a

Metaldyne Precision Forming  Fort Wayne, Inc., and the Company, dated as of
January 7, 2006, as may be amended from time to time (the " _Asset Purchase
Agreement_ "), including without limitation, the Guaranteed Obligations (as
such term is defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) of the Company
thereunder.

  



  

(b) The Assignee, from and after the Closing Date, hereby accepts the
assignment and assumes and agrees to observe and perform all of the duties,
obligations, terms, provisions and covenants, and to pay and discharge all of
the liabilities of the Company to be observed, performed, paid or discharged,
arising from and after the Closing Date, pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement including, without limitation, the Guaranteed Obligations (as such
term is defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement)

  

of the Company thereunder.

  



  

(c) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of,
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

(d) The Company and the Assignee acknowledge and agree that Forming
Technologies is an intended third party beneficiary to the Agreement and that
Forming Technologies shall be entitled to enforce its rights as a third party
beneficiary under this Agreement accordingly. The Company and Assignee each
hereby covenant to provide an executed copy of this Agreement to Forming

These provisions may not be amended or modified without the written consent
of Forming Technologies.

  



        
   

  



  

 ** _Amendment_**

  



  

March 10, 2006

  



  

Reference is made to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of
January 7, 2006, as amended (the " _Asset Purchase Agreement_ "), among
Metaldyne Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Metaldyne
Precision Forming  Fort Wayne, Inc., an Indiana corporation and Metaldyne
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (each a " _Seller_ " and collectively,
the " _Sellers_ "), and FormTech Industries LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (successor by conversion to Forming Technologies, Inc.) ("
_Purchaser_ "). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this
Amendment shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Asset Purchase
Agreement.

  



  

The Purchaser and the Sellers hereby agree that:

  



  

(i) The "owned vehicles" schedule attached to Section 1.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter is hereby deleted and replaced by the "owned
vehicles" schedule attached to this Amendment.

  



  

(ii) _Section 1.1(b) _of the Company Disclosure Letter is amended to include
the following:

  



  

MK Chambers Company

  

2251 Johnson Mills Rd

  

North Branch, MI 48461

  



  

Springco

  

12500 Elmwood Ave.

  

Cleveland, OH 44111

Sterling Heights, MI 48312

  



  

Great Lakes Production Support

  

24600 Wood Ct.

  

Macomb, MI 48042

  



  

(iii) _Section 4.2.8_ of the Asset Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety as follows:

  

### 

  

### Section 4.2.8 _Other Agreements_. Buyer and Sellers (or an affiliate
of Sellers) shall enter into the agreement attached hereto as Exhibit D.

  



  

(iv) If the transaction contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement is
consummated and the Purchase Price is received by the Sellers by or before
11:59 p.m. on March 10, 2006, then the reference to "$3,500,000" in Section
2.5(b) of the Asset Purchase Agreement shall

  

   

     
   

  



  

be replaced with "$5,700,000."  For the avoidance of doubt, if the Closing
occurs after 12:01 a.m. on March 11, 2006, then such reference to
"$3,500,000" shall remain unchanged.

  



  

(v) Schedule A to the Supply Agreement is hereby amended by adding the
following "Note":

  



  

(3) In addition to the unit prices set forth in the table above, as soon
after the Closing Date as Buyer and Sellers agree to the logistics for FOB
delivery at Royal Oak, but in no event later than 60 days after the Closing,
the unit prices set forth above shall no longer apply and shall be replaced
in their entirety with the pricing schedule set forth on Schedule 1 hereto.
Additionally, footnote (2) of Schedule A to the Supply Agreement shall be
eliminated once the prices on Schedule 1 go into effect.

  



  

(vi) The conditions set forth in Section 5.2.2(b) of the Asset Purchase
Agreement have been satisfied.

  



  

(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or Section
1.2 of Company Disclosure Letter, the Buyer and Sellers hereby agree as
follows:

  



  

(A) Fuji ANW30 Serial #14764, installed in January 2005, and all associated
machine tooling with respect thereto (i.e., all durable and perishable tools)
constitutes an Excluded Asset hereunder (the " _Fuji 14764_ "). The Sellers
have taken possession of Fuji 14764 as of the Closing Date. The Sellers have
also taken possession of one (1) Fuji ANW30 that had been held in a Fuji
warehouse in January 2006 (such Fuji ANW30, the " _Warehoused Fuji_ "). The
Warehoused Fuji constitutes an Excluded Asset hereunder. The Fuji ANW30
#14765, installed in January 2005, constitutes an Asset to be purchased by
the Buyer hereunder;

  



  

(B) any other Fuji located on Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property as
of the Closing Date shall be included in the "Assets" purchased by the Buyer
hereunder; and

  



  

(C) any other Fuji not located on Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property
as of the Closing Date shall be "Excluded Assets."

  



  

Except as expressly provided herein, this Amendment shall not constitute a
consent to or modification of any other provision, term or condition of the
Asset Purchase Agreement. All terms, provisions, covenants, representations,
warranties, agreements and conditions contained in the Asset Purchase
Agreement, as amended hereby, are ratified and confirmed in all respects and
shall remain in full force and effect.

  



  

This Amendment shall be governed in all respects, including as to validity,
interpretation and effect, by the internal laws of the State of  New York,
without giving effect to the conflict of laws rules thereof. Section 9.9.4 of
the Asset Purchase Agreement shall be deemed applicable to this Amendment.

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

This Amendment may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original and all of which shall together constitute one and the
same instrument.

The above is based upon Farmington Hills continuing to provide their
Requirement Schedule daily to Royal Oak by 11:00 a.m. the previous workday.
Farmington Hills would be responsible to pick up all their parts at the Royal
Oak location. Royal Oak will accommodate a scheduled one-hour pick-up window
by Farmington Hills with pick list. Items that do not make the truck must be
delivered by Royal Oak at their expense if line shutdown at Farmington Hills
is at risk. Return of empty racks would be Farmington Hills responsibility.
