     (3)  |   | BAYERNGAS UK LIMITED, a company registered in England
(company registration number 05088411) of Genesis House, 1and2 The Grange, High
Street, Westerham, Kent TN16 1AH (the _Purchaser s Parent_),  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(together the _parties_ and each a _party_ ). 

  

Words and expressions used in this Agreement shall be interpreted in
accordance with Schedule 9. 

  

Whereas: 

   

     (A)  |   | The Seller wishes to sell and the Purchaser wishes to
buy the Cygnus Interests on the terms and conditions set out herein.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (B)  |   | The Seller has submitted an application for the
Exploration Blocks to the Secretary of State pursuant to the 26th Licensing
Round. In the event that the Seller is awarded any of the Exploration Blocks
then the Seller wishes to sell and the Purchaser wishes to buy
the Exploration Interests relating to such Exploration Blocks on the terms
and conditions set out herein.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (C)  |   | The Purchasers Parent has entered into this Agreement
for the purpose of guaranteeing the obligations of the Purchaser in
accordance with clause 33.  
---|---|--- 
       

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

IT IS AGREED: 

   

1. Sale and Purchase 

  

1.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Seller hereby agrees to
transfer to the Purchaser with full title guarantee and free from all
Encumbrances and the Purchaser hereby agrees to acquire from the Seller the
Interests. 

  

1.2 The transfers referred to in clause 1.1 shall, as between the parties,
subject to clause 5 and clause 7, be deemed for all purposes to be made with
effect on and from the Effective Date. 

   

2. Price 

  

2.1 The consideration for the transfer of the Interests shall be the payment
by the Purchaser to the Seller of the sum of one hundred and ten million
Dollars ($110,000,000) (the _Base Price_ ) plus the Estimated Aggregate Cash
Call Amount (the _Consideration_ ). 

  

2.2 Where any sums are payable by the Purchaser to the Seller or by the Seller
to the Purchaser, pursuant to an adjustment (an _Adjustment_ ) pursuant to
clause 6.1 or pursuant to a claim under clause 9, the same shall operate by
way of increases or decreases, as the case may be, in the Consideration. 

  

2.3 If following the Cygnus Interests Closing any Adjustments are payable
pursuant to clause 2.2 the Seller shall provide the Purchaser, within thirty
(30) Business Days following the Cygnus Interests Closing, with a written
statement (the _Final Closing Statement_ ) giving the final amount of the
Consideration and the adjustment to be made. If the Purchaser and the Seller
fail to agree any such statement within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt
by the Purchaser, the statement shall be referred for determination in
accordance with the provisions of clause 2.4. The agreed or determined
amount, to the extent not already paid or taken into account on the Cygnus
Interests Closing, shall be paid by the Purchaser or the Seller (as the case
may be). Payment of agreed or disputed amounts or portions thereof shall be
made within five (5) Business Days following either agreement of the
Purchaser and the Seller or determination under clause 2.4 (as the case may
be). 

  

2.4 If the Purchaser and the Seller cannot reach agreement on the contents of
all or part of the statements referred to in this clause 2 within the time
limits provided in clause 2.3, the disputed items may be referred by either
the Seller or the Purchaser for determination by an independent chartered
accountant nominated by the Purchaser and the Seller or, in the absence of
agreement between the Purchaser and the Seller within five (5) Business Days
of the Purchaser or the Seller notifying the other party that it proposes to
refer the dispute to an expert, by the President of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The nominated chartered
accountant shall be afforded access to such books, records, accounts and
documents in the possession of the parties as he may reasonably request, and
he shall act as expert not as arbitrator. The said accountants determination
shall, in the absence of fraud or manifest error, be final and binding on the
parties, his fees and disbursements shall be borne as to fifty per cent (50%)
thereof by the Seller and as to fifty per cent (50%) thereof by the Purchaser
and the parties shall bear their own costs in respect of such reference. 

  

2.5 The Seller shall promptly provide the Purchaser with copies of all
reports, billing statements and correspondence and any other relevant
documentation in support of the 

      ##### 

  

    

statement referred to in clause 2.3. The Purchaser and the Seller shall liaise
on the compilation and agreement of the said statement. 

   

3. Cygnus Interests Conditions Precedent 

  

3.1 The obligations of the parties to complete the sale and purchase of the
Cygnus Interests under this Agreement are conditional on satisfaction of the
following conditions: 

   

     (a)  |   | the Secretarys written consent to the assignment of
the Cygnus Interests and the transaction contemplated by this Agreement being
obtained, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Seller and the
Purchaser; and  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (b)  |   | all necessary written consents, approvals or waivers as
the case may be by the Relevant Third Parties in relation to the transfer of
the Cygnus Interests being obtained, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser, and the execution of
the Assignment Documents relating to the Cygnus Interests by such Relevant
Third Parties (other than the Secretary).  
---|---|--- 
   

 

3.2 The parties shall each use all reasonable endeavours to obtain fulfilment
of the conditions set out in clauses 3.1(a) and 3.1(b) within sixty (60) days
of the date hereof (or such later date as may be agreed). 

  

3.3 If the Cygnus Interests Closing has not occurred within the period
specified in clause 3.2, the Purchaser and the Seller shall promptly meet and
discuss in good faith when the relevant condition(s) may be expected to be
satisfied. If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to agree an alternative
date for the satisfaction of the relevant condition(s) to the Cygnus
Interests Closing set out in clause 3.1, then either the Seller or the
Purchaser may, by the serving of thirty (30) days notice on the other,
terminate this Agreement, such termination to take effect (subject to clause
3.4) on the expiry of such thirty (30) day notice period and be
without prejudice to any accrued rights the parties may have arising from any
prior breach of the terms of this Agreement save that the Surviving
Provisions shall continue in full force and effect. In the event that the
relevant condition(s) precedent to the Cygnus Interests Closing are satisfied
prior to the expiry of such thirty (30) day notice period, the parties shall
proceed to Cygnus Interests Closing. 

  

3.4 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 3.3, the Seller or the Purchaser,
as the case may be, may, by notice served within fourteen (14) days of
receipt of any notice which may have been served upon it pursuant to clause
3.3, request an extension of the time for the satisfaction of the relevant
condition(s) precedent for a period of no more than two (2) Months (the
_Cygnus Interests Closing Extension Period_ ). The party receiving any such
notice pursuant to this clause 3.4 shall not unreasonably withhold or delay
its agreement to any such request. In the event that the time for the
satisfaction of the relevant condition(s) precedent is extended and such
condition(s) precedent are: 

   

     (a)  |   | satisfied prior to the expiry of the Cygnus Interests
Closing Extension Period, the parties shall proceed to Cygnus Interests
Closing; or  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (b)  |   | not satisfied prior to the expiry of the Cygnus
Interests Closing Extension Period, this Agreement shall terminate without
prejudice to any accrued rights the parties may have arising from any prior
breach of the terms of this Agreement save that the Surviving Provisions
shall continue in full force and effect.  
---|---|--- 
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

4. Interim Period 

  

4.1 During the Interim Period (to the extent the same falls after the date
hereof), the Seller shall: 

   

     (a)  |   | (having notified the Purchaser in advance of the
subject matter thereof and acting in accordance with Good Industry Practice
and subject to the terms of the Interests Documents) consult with the
Purchaser and, where reasonably practicable, take into account any
reasonable requests or directions of the Purchaser in relation to any
material decision in connection with the Cygnus Interests and on any
resolutions submitted to meetings of the Operating Committee (as defined in
the Joint Operating Agreement for the Cygnus Licences);  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (b)  |   | not (by act or omission) breach in any material respect
any of the provisions of the Cygnus Interest Documents (and shall notify the

aware which indicate that there has been such a material breach by any other
party or that such a material breach by the Seller has occurred);  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (c)  |   | not enter into or become party to any new licences,
operating agreements, farm-in or farm-out agreements, unitisation agreements,
transportation agreements, oil or gas sale or supply agreements or any other
agreement or undertaking (by whatever name called) in relation to
or affecting the Cygnus Interests or trade, relinquish, surrender, sell,
assign or amend the Cygnus Interests (or agree to do any of the foregoing in
the future) without the prior written approval of the Purchaser (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) save as contemplated by this Agreement
and/or to the extent required by legislation or Government regulation;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (d)  |   | continue to carry on its activities in relation to the
Cygnus Interests in all respects in the ordinary and usual course of business
and comply with previously agreed decisions of the operating committees in
relation to the Cygnus Interests and any Cygnus Interests Documents to which
it is a party and the CGG Agreement;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (e)  |   | not approve any work programme, budget, expenditure or
capital commitment relating to the Cygnus Interests involving expenditure in
excess of one hundred thousand Pounds (£100,000) (Sellers share) in any case
other than:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | any such expenditure as is covered by any budget
approved and disclosed in writing to the Purchaser prior to the date of this
Agreement; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | any such expenditure in respect of which the Purchaser
has given its prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); or  
      
    | (iii)  |   | any expenditure necessitated by any emergency (in
which case the Seller shall consult with the Purchaser to the extent
practicable in the circumstances and, where reasonably practicable, take into
account any reasonable requests or directions of the Purchaser);  
   

  

     (f)  |   | conduct its affairs regarding the Cygnus Interests
(and, to the extent within its reasonable control, operations thereunder) in
accordance with Good Industry Practice;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (g)  |   | keep the Purchaser fully informed in a timely manner on
any and all matters (not of a routine nature) relating to the Cygnus
Interests;  
---|---|--- 
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

     (h)  |   | not do or omit to do anything which would result in a
breach of any of the Warranties given by it if such Warranties were repeated
at Cygnus Interests Closing;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (i)  |   | not, except without the prior written approval of the
Purchaser (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), amend
or agree to amend any of the Cygnus Interest Documents in any respect in so
far as such amendment or agreement to amend relates to or affects the Cygnus
Interests or waive or agree to waive any of its rights or remedies thereunder
or arising therefrom in so far as such rights and remedies relate to the
Cygnus Interests;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (j)  |   | co-operate with the Purchaser so as to ensure an
efficient handover of the Cygnus Interests on the Cygnus Interests Closing
Date;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (k)  |   | not propose, approve or participate in any sole risk
operations in respect of the Cygnus Interests;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (l)  |   | immediately notify the Purchaser in writing of any
matter or proposal that may: (i) have a material adverse effect on the value
of the Cygnus Interests; (ii) constitute a breach of a Warranty set out in
Schedule 1 (as if such Warranty was repeated continuously throughout
the Interim Period); or (iii) be materially inconsistent with information set
out in the Disclosure Letter, and consult with the Purchaser in relation to
that matter or proposal and take account of any reasonable requests or
directions of the Purchaser;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (m)  |   | to the extent practicable, consult with the Purchaser
in relation to any matter requiring its vote under the Joint Operating
Agreement or any other operating agreement relating to the Cygnus Interests
and, where reasonably practicable, take account of the Purchasers
reasonable requests or directions; and  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (n)  |   | not dispose of or grant any Encumbrance in respect of
any or all parts of the Cygnus Interests.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

5. Cygnus Interests Closing 

  

5.1 The Cygnus Interests Closing shall take place at the London offices of the
Sellers lawyers or such other place as the Purchaser and the Seller may
agree from time to time on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date on
which the conditions set out in clause 3.1 have been fulfilled, or on such
other date as may be agreed in writing between the Seller and the Purchaser
(the _Cygnus Interests Closing Date_ ). 

  

5.2 At the Cygnus Interests Closing each of the Purchaser and the Seller shall
deliver or perform (or ensure that there is delivered or performed) all those
documents, items and actions respectively listed in relation to that party or
any of its Affiliates (as the case may be) in Schedule 5. 

  

5.3 If either the Seller or the Purchaser fails to comply with any obligation
in Schedule 5, the other party shall be entitled (in addition to and without
prejudice to all other rights and remedies available) by written notice to
the party in default on the date the Cygnus Interests Closing would otherwise
be due to take place, to: 

   

     (a)  |   | require the Cygnus Interests Closing to take place so
far as practicable having regard to the defaults which have occurred; or  
---|---|--- 
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

     (b)  |   | fix a new date for the Cygnus Interests Closing (being
not more than ten (10) Business Days after the original date proposed for
Cygnus Interests Closing) in which case the provisions of this clause 5
(other than this clause 5.3) and Schedule 5 shall apply to the Cygnus
Interests Closing as so deferred but on the basis that such deferral may only
occur once.  
---|---|--- 
   

 

5.4 If either the Seller or the Purchaser fails to comply with any obligation
in Schedule 5 on the deferred date for Cygnus Interests Closing, the other
party shall be entitled (in addition to and without prejudice to all other
rights and remedies available) by written notice to the party in default, to
terminate this Agreement with immediate effect save that the Surviving
Provisions shall continue in full force and effect. 

   

6. Post Cygnus Interests Closing Adjustments 

  

6.1 Following the Cygnus Interests Closing Date, adjustment payments shall be
made in accordance with clause 2 to account for amounts falling due as
Adjustments as provided for in clause 6.2. 

  

6.2 The Purchaser shall be liable to the Seller for an amount calculated as an
aggregate of the following: 

   

     (a)  |   | all cash calls, advances and other payments made by (or
on behalf of) the Seller in respect of the Cygnus Interests under any of the
Cygnus Interest Documents and pursuant to the CGG Agreement to the extent it
has been assigned to the Purchaser on terms acceptable to the Purchaser and
Seller (but excluding payments made pursuant to the insurance arrangements
and, for the avoidance of doubt, the CGG Agreement to the extent it has not
been so assigned) on or after the Effective Date which relate to expenditure
incurred between the Effective Date and the Cygnus Interests Closing Date;
plus  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (b)  |   | any amounts owing to, or pre-paid or overpaid by (or on
behalf of) the Seller in respect of the Interests under any of the Cygnus
Interest Documents before the Effective Date which have not been paid or
repaid to the Seller at the Cygnus Interests Closing Date; less  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (c)  |   | the sum of:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | the Estimated Aggregate Cash Call Amount;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | all cash calls, advances and other payments made by
(or on behalf of) the Seller in respect of the Cygnus Interests under any of
the Cygnus Interest Documents on or after the Effective Date which relate to
expenditure incurred before the Effective Date;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | any amounts owed, unpaid or underpaid by (or on
behalf of) the Seller in respect of the Interests under any of the Cygnus
Interest Documents before the Effective Date which have not been paid by the
Seller at the Cygnus Interests Closing Date; and  
      
    | (iv)  |   | any amounts received and retained without claim by the
Seller under the Cygnus Interest Documents on or after the Effective Date in
respect of the Cygnus Interests which accrue and relate to any event arising
on or after the  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | Effective Date excepting those amounts which are the
subject of clauses 6.2(a) and 6.2(b) above.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

 

The amount calculated in accordance with clause 6.2 shall be collectively
referred to as the  _Adjustments_. 

  

6.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this clause 6 are subject to
the provisions of clause 11 and no amount paid by either party in accordance
with this clause 6 shall be construed as a waiver of such partys rights
pursuant to clause 11 or the Warranties after the Cygnus Interests Closing. 

   

7. Exploration Interests Conditions Precedent 

  

7.1 The obligations of the Purchaser and the Seller to complete the sale and

---|---|--- 
   

  

     (b)  |   | Cygnus Interests Closing having occurred;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (c)  |   | the Secretarys written consent to the assignment of
the Exploration Interests and the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
being obtained, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Seller and

---|---|--- 
   

  

     (d)  |   | all necessary written consents, approvals or waivers as
the case may be by the Relevant Third Parties in relation to the transfer of
the Exploration Interests being obtained (including, without limitation,
waivers by any Relevant Third Parties of any and all pre-emptive rights that
it may have to the Exploration Interests), in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser, and the execution of the
Assignment Documents relating to the Exploration Interests by such Relevant
Third Parties (other than the Secretary).  
---|---|--- 
   

 

7.2 The Purchaser and the Seller shall each use all reasonable endeavours to
obtain fulfilment of the conditions set out in clauses 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.1(c)
and 7.1(d) within sixty (60) days from the date the Exploration Blocks are
awarded to the Seller (or such later date as may be agreed). 

  

7.3 If the Exploration Interests Closing has not occurred within the period
specified in clause 7.2, the Purchaser and the Seller shall promptly meet and
discuss in good faith when the relevant condition(s) may be expected to be
satisfied. If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to agree an alternative
date for the satisfaction of the relevant condition(s) to the Exploration
Interests Closing set out in clause 7.1, then either the Seller or the
Purchaser may, by the serving of thirty (30) days notice on the other,
terminate the provisions of this Agreement which relate to (but only to the
extent that they relate to) the sale and purchase of the Exploration
Interests, such termination to take effect (subject to clause 7.4) on the
expiry of such thirty (30) day notice period and be without prejudice to any
accrued rights the parties may have arising from any prior breach of the
terms of this Agreement. In the event that the relevant condition(s)
precedent to the Exploration Interests Closing are satisfied prior to the
expiry of such thirty (30) day notice period, the parties shall proceed to
Exploration Interests Closing. 

       ##### 

  

    

7.4 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 7.3, the Seller or the Purchaser,

15.5 The Seller and the Purchaser intend that article 5 of the Value Added Tax
(Special Provisions) Order 1995 shall apply to the sale of the Interests

full disclosure of all material facts that the transaction hereunder is
subject to VAT, the Purchaser undertakes that, if called upon to do so by the

15.6 and HM Revenue and Customs subsequently determine that all or part of such
VAT was not properly chargeable, the Seller shall repay such amount as was
not properly chargeable to the Purchaser. The Seller shall make the repayment
promptly after any relevant determination by HM Revenue and Customs, unless it
has already accounted to HM Revenue and Customs for the VAT. In that case, the
Seller shall apply for a refund of the VAT (plus any interest payable by HM
Revenue and Customs), use reasonable endeavours to obtain a refund as speedily
as practicable, and pay to the Purchaser the amount of the refund and any
interest, to the extent received, promptly following receipt from HM Revenue and

respect of which VAT has been paid or received shall be made on a basis

is required to be accounted for in full to H M. Revenue and Customs, but
otherwise shall be made on a basis which leaves the recipient in no better

continuing member of the Purchaser Group. Any purported assignment in
contravention of this clause 20 shall be void. 

  

20.2 If an assignment is made in accordance with this clause 20, the

24. Conflict with other Agreements 

  

If there is any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any other
agreement, this Agreement shall prevail (as between the parties to this
Agreement and as between any members of the Seller Group and any members of
the Purchaser Group) unless (i) such other agreement expressly states that it
overrides this Agreement in the relevant respect and (ii) the Seller and
the Purchaser are either also parties to that other agreement or otherwise
expressly agree in writing that such other agreement shall override this
Agreement in that respect. 

   

25. Whole Agreement 

  

This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents together set out the whole
agreement between the parties in respect of the sale and purchase of the
Interests and supersede any prior agreement (whether oral or written)
relating to the Proposed Transaction. It is agreed that: 

   

     (a)  |   | no party shall have any claim or remedy in respect of
any statement, representation, warranty or undertaking made by or on behalf
of the other party (or any of its Connected Persons) in relation to the
Proposed Transaction which is not expressly set out in this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (b)  |   | any terms or conditions implied by law in any
jurisdiction in relation to the Proposed Transaction are excluded to the
fullest extent permitted by law or, if incapable of exclusion, any right, or
remedies in relation to them are irrevocably waived;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (c)  |   | the only right or remedy of a party in relation to any
provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be for
breach of this Agreement or the relevant Transaction Document; and  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (d)  |   | except for any liability in respect of a breach of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, no party (or any of its
Connected Persons) shall owe any duty of care or have any liability in tort
or otherwise to the other party (or its respective Connected Persons)
in relation to the Proposed Transaction,  
---|---|--- 
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

 

provided that this clause shall not exclude any liability for (or remedy in
respect of) fraudulent misrepresentation. Each party agrees to the terms of
this clause 25 on its own behalf and as agent for each of its Connected
Persons. For the purpose of this clause, _Connected Persons_ means
(in relation to a party) the officers, employees, agents and advisors of that
party or any of its Affiliates. 

   

26. Waivers, Rights and Remedies 

  

Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no failure or delay by any
party in exercising any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transaction Documents shall affect or operate as a waiver or variation of
that right or remedy or preclude its exercise at any subsequent time. No
single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall preclude any
further exercise of it or the exercise of any other remedy. 

   

27. Counterparts 

  

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by each
party on separate counterparts. Each counterpart is an original, but all
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery
of a counterpart of this Agreement by e-mail attachment or telecopy shall be
an effective mode of delivery. 

   

28. Variations 

  

No amendment of this Agreement (or of any other Transaction Document) shall be
valid unless it is in writing and duly executed by or on behalf of all of the
parties to it. 

   

29. Invalidity 

  

Each of the provisions of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
is severable. If any such provision is held to be or becomes invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under the law of any jurisdiction, it shall have
no effect in that respect and the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to
replace it in that respect with a valid and enforceable substitute provision
the effect of which is as close to its intended effect as possible. 

   

30. Waiver of Right of Set Off 

  

30.1 Each party waives and relinquishes any right of set off or counterclaim,
deduction or retention which it might otherwise have in respect of any claim
against or out of any payments which that party may be obliged to make (or
procure to be made) to the other party pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise. 

   

31. Third Party Enforcement Rights 

  

31.1 The persons specified in clause 9.5 (Seller Warranties) and the Connected
Persons specified in clause 25 (Whole Agreement) shall have the right to
enforce the relevant terms of 

      ##### 

  

    

that clause by reason of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
This right is subject to (i) the rights of the parties to amend or vary or
terminate this Agreement without the consent of any of the persons specified
in clause 9.5 or any Connected Person and (ii) the other terms and conditions
of this Agreement. 

  

31.2 Except as provided in clause 31.1, a person who is not a party to this
Agreement shall have no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties)
Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms. 

   

32. Governing Law and Jurisdiction 

  

32.1 This Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in
accordance with, English law. 

  

32.2 English courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to all
disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (including
claims for set-off and counterclaims), including disputes arising out of or
in connection with: (i) the creation, validity, effect,
interpretation, performance or non-performance of, or the legal relationships
established by, this Agreement; and (ii) any non-contractual obligations
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. For such purposes each
party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts, waives
any objections to the jurisdiction of those courts and irrevocably agrees
that a judgment or order of the English courts in connection with this
Agreement is conclusive and binding on it and may be enforced against it in
the courts of any other jurisdiction. 

   

33. Guarantee 

  

33.1 In consideration of the Seller entering into this Agreement, the
Purchasers Parent unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Seller
as a continuing obligation that the Purchaser will comply properly and
punctually with its obligations under this Agreement and each Transaction
Document. The Purchasers Parents obligations under this clause 33 are
primary obligations and not those of a mere surety. 

  

33.2 The Purchasers Parents liability under this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents shall not be discharged or impaired by: 

   

     (a)  |   | any amendment, variation or assignment of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or any waiver of its or their terms;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (b)  |   | any full or partial release of, or granting of time or
other indulgence to, the Purchaser or any third party;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (c)  |   | any winding up, dissolution, reconstruction, legal
limitation, incapacity or lack of corporate power or authority or other
circumstances affecting the Purchaser or the Seller (or any act taken by the
Seller or the Purchaser in relation to any such event); or  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (d)  |   | any other act, event, neglect or omission (whether or
not known to the Purchaser, the Seller or the Purchasers Parent) which would
or might (but for this clause) operate to impair or discharge the Purchasers
Parents liability or afford the Purchasers Parent or the Purchaser any
legal or equitable defence,  
---|---|--- 
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

 

in each case whether or not the Purchasers Parent has been notified or is
otherwise aware of any of the matters set out above. 

  

33.3 In consideration of the Seller entering into this Agreement, as a
separate, additional continuing and primary obligation, the Purchasers
Parent undertakes to indemnify the Seller and each of its Affiliates against
any costs or losses suffered or incurred by any of them as a result of the
Purchasers failure to comply properly and punctually with its obligations
under this Agreement or any Transaction Document. 

       #####

16\. The Seller is not party to any litigation or arbitration or
administrative proceedings in respect of which proceedings have been
initiated or summons or other formal pleading has been served or judgement
issued, nor is there any claim (whether or not formulated within a
formal pleading as aforesaid) or dispute in relation to, and which is likely
materially to prejudice or detrimentally affect in any material manner, the
Cygnus Interests, and the Seller is not aware that any such litigation,
arbitration, administrative proceedings, claim or dispute is threatened
or pending either by or against the Seller, and there are no facts known to
the Seller which are likely to give rise to any claim or dispute which is

receive less than the amounts due to them. There are no proceedings
in relation to any compromise or arrangement with creditors or any winding
up, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings concerning the Seller or any of its

SCHEDULE 2 

   

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY 

  

Limitations on Seller Liability 

  

1\. _Time Limits_. The Seller shall not be liable for any Claim unless the
Seller receives from the Purchaser written notice containing specific details
of the Claim including the Purchasers estimate (on a without prejudice
basis) of the amount of the Claim prior to the date that is twelve (12)
Months after the Cygnus Interests Closing Date. 

  

2\. _Thresholds for Claims_. The Seller shall not be liable for any single
Claim: 

   

     (a)  |   | unless the amount of the liability pursuant to that
single Claim exceeds five hundred thousand Dollars ($500,000); and  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (b)  |   | unless the aggregate amount of the liability of the
Seller for all Claims not excluded by sub paragraph (a) exceeds two per cent
(2%) of the Consideration.  
---|---|--- 
   

 

3\. _Maximum limit for Claims_. Other than in respect of a Claim under the
Title Warranties or the Status Warranties, the aggregate amount of the
liability of the Seller for all Claims shall not exceed twenty-five per cent
(25%) of the Consideration. 

  

4\. _Maximum limit for indemnity claims._ The aggregate amount of the
liability of the Seller for all claims under one or more indemnities pursuant
to this Agreement shall not exceed fifty per cent (50%) of the
Consideration. 

  

5\. _Claim to be withdrawn unless litigation commenced_. Any claim by the
Purchaser under this Agreement (except for any claim which is based on a
contingent liability) shall (if it has not been previously satisfied, settled
or withdrawn) be deemed to have been withdrawn nine (9) Months after (i) the
notice is given pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Schedule or (ii) the
Purchaser becomes aware of its right to make a claim (other than a Claim),
unless legal proceedings in respect of it have been commenced by being both
issued and served. 

  

6\. _Matters disclosed_. The Seller shall not be liable for any Claim if and
to the extent that the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to
such Claim is fairly disclosed in this Agreement, the Disclosure Letter, any
Transaction Document or any document disclosed in the Data Room. 

  

7\. _Contingent liabilities_. If any claim under this Agreement is based upon
a liability which is contingent only, the Seller shall not be liable to pay
unless and until such contingent liability gives rise to an obligation to
make a payment (but the Purchaser has the right under paragraph 1 of this
Schedule 2 to give notice of any Claim before such time). 

  

8\. _No liability for claims arising from acts or omissions of Purchaser_. The
Seller shall not be liable for any claim under this Agreement to the extent
that it would not have arisen but for, or has been increased or not reduced
as a result of, any voluntary act, omission or transaction carried out: 

   

     (a)  |   | after the Cygnus Interests Closing by the Purchaser or
any member of the Purchaser Group (or its respective directors, employees or
agents or successors in title); or  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (b)  |   | before the Cygnus Interests Closing by any member of
the Seller Group at the direction or request of the Purchaser or any member
of the Purchaser Group,  
---|---|--- 
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

 

outside the ordinary and usual course of business as at the Cygnus Interests
Closing or pursuant to a legally binding commitment vested on or before such
date. 

  

9\. _Purchaser s duty to mitigate_. The Purchaser shall procure that all
reasonable steps are taken to avoid or mitigate any loss or damage which it
may suffer in consequence of any breach by the Seller of the terms of this
Agreement or any fact, matter, event or circumstance likely to give rise to a
claim. 

  

10\. _Recovery from third party after payment from Seller_. Where the Seller
has made a payment to the Purchaser in relation to any claim and the
Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group is entitled to recover
(whether by insurance, payment, discount, credit, relief or otherwise) from a
third party a sum which indemnifies or compensates the Purchaser or any member
of the Purchaser Group (in whole or in part) in respect of the liability or
loss which is the subject of a claim, the Purchaser or relevant member of the
Purchaser Group shall (i) promptly notify the Seller of the fact and provide
such information as the Seller may reasonably require (ii) take
all reasonable steps or proceedings as the Seller may require to enforce such
right and (iii) pay to the Seller as soon as practicable after receipt so
much of the amount paid by the Seller as does not exceed the amount recovered
by the third party (net of taxation and less any reasonable costs of recovery
and applicable deductibles). 

  

11\. _Insured Claims._ The Seller shall not be liable in respect of any Claim
to the extent that the amount of such Claim is covered by a policy of
insurance (net of any reasonable costs of recovery and applicable
deductibles) or would have been so covered if the policies of insurance
had been maintained after Closing on no less favourable terms than those
existing at the date of this Agreement. 

  

12\. _Net financial benefit_. The Seller shall not be liable to satisfy any
claim to the extent of any corresponding saving by or net quantifiable
financial benefit to the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group
arising from the matter(s) giving rise to such claim, including the amount
(if any) by which any tax for which the Purchaser or any member of the
Purchaser Group would otherwise have been accountable or liable to be
assessed is actually reduced or extinguished as a result of the matter(s)
giving rise to the claim but having regard to any delay which may
be experienced in enforcing or utilising such net benefit or saving. __ 

  

13\. _No liability for legislation or changes in rates of tax_. The Seller
shall not be liable for any claim if and to the extent it is attributable to,
or the amount of such claim is increased as a result of, any (i) legislation
not in force at the date of this Agreement (ii) change of law (or any change
in interpretation on the basis of case law), regulation,
directive, requirement or administrative practice or (iii) change in the
rates of taxation in force at the date of this Agreement, in each case having
retrospective effect. 

  

14\. _No double recovery_. The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover
damages or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than
once in respect of any one liability, loss, cost, shortfall, damage,
deficiency, breach or other set of circumstances which gives rise to more
than one claim. 

  

15\. _Consequential loss_. Neither the Purchaser nor any member of the
Purchaser Group shall be entitled to claim for any punitive, special,
indirect or consequential loss or loss of profit or for any loss of goodwill
or possible business after Closing, whether actual or prospective. 

  

16\. _Purchaser s knowledge_. The Seller shall not be liable for any Claim if

detail to understand the associated liability. 

  

17\. _Seller to have opportunity to remedy breaches_. If a breach of the

compensation if it gives the Seller written notice of the breach and the
breach is not remedied by the Seller as soon as practicably possible and in
any event within fifteen (15) days after the date on which such notice is

such breach. Provided that the written notice of the breach is received
by the Seller within the twelve (12) Month period set out in paragraph 1, the

Seller under this Agreement (except for any claim which is based on a

or withdrawn) be deemed to have been withdrawn nine (9) Months after the
Seller becomes aware of its right to make a claim, unless legal proceedings in
respect of it have been commenced by being both issued and served. 

  

3\. _Contingent liabilities_. If any claim under this Agreement is based upon
a liability which is contingent only, the Purchaser shall not be liable to
pay unless and until such contingent liability gives rise to an obligation to
make a payment (but the Seller has the right to give notice of any claim
before such time). 

  

4\. _No liability for claims arising from acts or omissions of Seller_. The
Purchaser shall not be liable for any claim under this Agreement to the

steps are taken to avoid or mitigate any loss or damage which it may suffer

to give rise to a claim. 

       ##### 

  

    

6\. _Recovery from third party after payment from Purchaser_. Where the
Purchaser has made a payment to the Seller in relation to any claim and the
Seller or any member of the Seller Group is entitled to recover (whether by
insurance, payment, discount, credit, relief or otherwise) from a third party
a sum which indemnifies or compensates the Seller or any member of the Seller
Group (in whole or in part) in respect of the liability or loss which is the
subject of a claim, the Seller or relevant member of the Seller Group shall
(i) promptly notify the Purchaser of the fact and provide such information as
the Purchaser may reasonably require (ii) take all reasonable steps
or proceedings as the Purchaser may require to enforce such right and (iii)
pay to the Purchaser as soon as practicable after receipt so much of the
amount paid by the Purchaser as does not exceed the amount recovered by the
third party (net of taxation and less any reasonable costs of recovery and
applicable deductibles). 

  

7\. _Net financial benefit_. The Purchaser shall not be liable to satisfy any
claim to the extent of any corresponding saving by or net quantifiable
financial benefit to the Seller or any member of the Seller Group arising
from the matter(s) giving rise to such claim, including the amount (if any)
by which any tax for which the Seller or any member of the Seller Group
would otherwise have been accountable or liable to be assessed is actually
reduced or extinguished as a result of the matter(s) giving rise to the claim
but having regard to any delay which may be experienced in enforcing or
utilising such net benefit or saving. __ 

  

8\. _No double recovery_. The Seller shall not be entitled to recover damages
or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in

breach or other set of circumstances which gives rise to more than one
claim. 

  

9\. _Consequential loss_. Neither the Seller nor any member of the Seller
Group shall be entitled to claim for any punitive, special, indirect or
consequential loss or loss of profit or for any loss of goodwill or possible
business after Closing, whether actual or prospective.

2\. The Purchaser has obtained all corporate authorisations and all other

authorisations required to empower it to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents where failure to obtain them
would materially and adversely affect its ability to enter into and perform
its obligations under the Transaction Documents. 

  

3\. Entry into and performance by each member of the Purchaser Group of this
Agreement and/or any Transaction Document to which it is a party will not (i)
breach any provision of its memorandum and articles of association, by-laws

or regulations in its jurisdiction of incorporation or of any order, decree or
judgment of any court or any governmental or regulatory authority, where any
such breach would adversely affect to a material extent its ability to enter

receive less than the amounts due to them. There are no proceedings
in relation to any compromise or arrangement with creditors or any winding
up, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings concerning the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates and no events have occurred which would justify such
proceedings. No steps have been taken to enforce any security over any assets
of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and no event has occurred to give
the right to enforce such security.
