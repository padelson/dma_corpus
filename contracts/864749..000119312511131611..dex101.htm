     | 1. | Trimble Navigation Limited, a corporation incorporated and
existing under the laws of California in the United States of America, with
its registered office in Sunnyvale, California, United States of America (the
"Offeror"); and 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | Tekla Corporation, a public limited company incorporated and
existing under the laws of Finland, with its registered office in Espoo in
Finland (the "Company" and together with its subsidiaries the "Group" and
each such company a "Group Company"); 
---|---|--- 

each of the above parties is hereinafter referred to as a "Party" and
collectively to as the "Parties".

RECITALS



     | A. | The Company is a public limited company the shares of which
are listed on Nasdaq OMX Helsinki stock exchange (the "Helsinki Exchange")  
---|---|--- 



     | B. | The Offeror is a corporation the shares of which are listed
on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the United States of America. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | C. | The Boards of Directors of the Parties have each determined
by board resolutions that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and their shareholders to combine the businesses of the Offeror and
the Company through the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | D. | As of the Signing Date, the Company has issued a total of
22,586,200 shares, out of which 96,600 are held by the Company as treasury
shares, and 22,489,600 shares by other shareholders (the "Outstanding
Shares"). The Company or its subsidiaries have not authorized or issued any
options or other rights entitling to shares in the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.  
---|---|--- 



     | E. | The intention of the Parties is that in order to effect the
combination, the Offeror will indirectly through a wholly owned Finnish
subsidiary ("Trimble Finland"), offer to acquire all of the Outstanding
Shares through a public tender offer (the "Offer") and through subsequent
compulsory redemption proceedings in accordance with the Finnish Companies
Act ("Compulsory Redemption") or by merger or other instrument of business
integration, as the case may be. Any references herein to the Offeror shall,
where relevant, also include the Trimble Finland and vice versa.  
---|---|--- 



     | F. | The Parties acknowledge that it is the intention of Offeror
to cause the Outstanding Shares to be delisted from the Helsinki Exchange as
soon as permitted and practicable under applicable laws and regulations. 
---|---|--- 



     | G. | The Company is aware that the largest shareholder of the
Company, who as of the date hereof holds in the aggregate 8,596,020 shares in
Tekla, representing approximately [38] percent of the shares in the Company,
has given an irrevocable undertaking to the Offeror to accept the Offer in
respect of all shares held by such shareholder pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Offer.  
---|---|--- this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

NOW THEREFORE, the Parties hereby agree as follows:



   1. | PUBLIC TENDER OFFER 
---|--- 



   1.1 | Launch of the Tender Offer 
---|--- 

Provided that there has not been a breach of this Agreement and that the
Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Offeror
shall launch the Offer by means of a public announcement, including the terms
and conditions of the Offer, substantially in the form of Appendix A hereto
(the "Offer Announcement") on or about 9 May 2011 but no later than 23 May
2011 (the "Launch Date") and commence the Offer as promptly as possible after
the date of the Offer Announcement, tentatively on or about 19 May 2011. The
acceptance period under the Offer shall initially extend until 17 June 2011
(the "Offer Period"). The Offer Period may be extended by Offeror from time
to time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer. The date
when the title to the Outstanding Shares validly tendered in the Offer is
transferred to Offeror shall be referred to as the "Closing Date".

For the avoidance of doubt it is understood that the terms of the offer may
be amended as provided in the terms and subject to Finnish law.



   1.2 | Consideration 
---|--- 

In the Offer, the Offeror shall offer to acquire all the Outstanding Shares
for a consideration of EUR fifteen (15.00) in cash for each Outstanding Share
subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer.

 

It has been mutually agreed and understood by the Parties that the board of
directors of the Company may, pursuant to the authorization granted by the
annual general meeting held on 6 April 2011, resolve to distribute additional
dividends or other funds to its shareholders in the maximum amount of EUR 18,
000,000.00. The funds so distributed prior to the Closing Date shall result
in equal reduction in the above stated per share offer price.

The Company undertakes not to decide upon or make a distribution of dividends
or other funds to its shareholders in addition to as has been agreed to above
without the consent of the Offeror, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. In case of such additional dividend or distribution being decided
and/or made, and the Offeror nevertheless decides to complete the Offer, the
consideration paid in the Offer shall be decreased accordingly.



   1.3 | Conditions to completion 
---|--- 
 

The obligation of the Offeror to accept the tendered Outstanding Shares, which
have not been withdrawn, and to complete the Offer, shall be subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver by the
Offeror, of each of the following conditions:



     | (a) | the valid tender of Outstanding Shares representing
(together with any Outstanding Shares that may be held by the Offeror) more
than 90 percent of the issued and outstanding shares and votes of the Company
on a fully diluted basis (i.e. taking into consideration the effect of the
conversion of any and all options or rights entitling to shares in the
Company); 
---|---|--- 
 



5 consents, including competition clearances, and that any conditions set in
such permits, consents or clearances, including, but not limited to, any
requirements for the disposal of any assets of the Offeror or the Company or
any reorganization of the business of the Offeror or the Company, are
acceptable to the Offeror in that they are not materially adverse to the
Offeror or the Company or to the consummation of the Offer contemplated
hereunder; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | no event, circumstance or change having occurred after the
Launch Date that would result in or constitute, or can reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Change (as defined in Appendix B hereto); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | the other conditions set out in Appendix B hereto. 
---|---|--- 



   1.4 | De-listing 
---|--- 

It is the intention of the Offeror, subject to the Offeror acquiring more
than ninety per cent (90 %) of the total number of shares and voting power of
the then outstanding shares of the Company, to cause the shares of the Company
to be de-listed from the Helsinki Exchange as soon as permitted and
reasonably practicable under applicable laws and regulations.

If the Offeror shall resolve to commence the said de-listing, the Company
shall use its reasonable efforts to assist in such procedure at the request of
the Offeror, including taking promptly any required corporate decisions and
making such filings as may be necessary. 



   2. | RECOMMENDATION BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY 
---|--- 



   2.1 | The Recommendation 
---|--- 
 

Having evaluated the terms and conditions of the Offer as described in this
Agreement, the Company and its Board of Directors (represented by the
conflict free board members) consent to the Offer being made and undertake
that the Board of Directors of the Company (represented by the conflict free
board members) shall unanimously recommend that holders of Outstanding
Shares accept the Offer and tender their Outstanding Shares on the terms and
conditions of the Offer (the "Recommendation"). The form of Recommendation has
been attached to this Agreement as Appendix C and its contents shall be
made public (together, subject to a request by the Offeror, with any fairness
opinion (the "Fairness Opinion") obtained by the Board of Directors of the
Company) in connection with the initial announcement of the Offer. The Company
shall provide to the Offeror a final Recommendation incorporating the
statements of the Board of Directors of the Company, as required pursuant to
the Finnish Securities Markets Act, and the Fairness Opinion to be included in
the tender offer document prior to the tender offer document being published
no later than 23 May 2011.

 



6 ---|--- 



     | 2.2.1 | Fiduciary Duties 
---|---|--- 
 

Subject to the provisions set out or referred to in Section 4.4, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to the Closing Date withdraw,
modify or change the Recommendation if, based on a Competing Offer, Competing
Proposal or change in the valuation of the Company, or a material change of
circumstances of the Company, the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith after taking advice from its external legal
counsel and its financial advisers, and after consultation with the Board of
Directors of the Offeror, that such withdrawal, modification or change is
required in order for the Board of Directors to comply with mandatory
fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under Finnish laws (such duties
referred to as the "Fiduciary Duties").

 



     | 2.2.2 | Competing Offer 
---|---|--- 

In addition to the preconditions in Section 2.2.1 above, in the event of a
Competing Offer (as defined below) or a Competing Proposal (as defined in
Section 4.4(a)) the Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time prior
to the Closing Date, withdraw, modify or change the Recommendation if (and
only if), prior to such withdrawal, modification or change:



     | (a) | the Company has complied with its obligations under Section
4.4, and 
---|---|--- 



      | (b) | a final announcement regarding a public tender offer,
pursuant to the Finnish Securities Market Act of 1989 (the "SMA"), is
published other than related to the Offer, and a third party shall under such
announcement offer to purchase all the outstanding shares in the Company for a
consideration that, in the case of an all-cash offer, is higher than the
consideration offered by Offeror or, in the case of an offer with a
consideration of cash and securities or securities only, for a consideration
that has a higher value than the consideration offered by the Offeror, and
that has other terms and conditions which are more favourable to
the Companys shareholders than the terms and conditions offered by Offeror
pursuant to this Agreement (such an offer hereinafter the "Competing Offer");
and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | the Board of Directors of the Company has, to the extent
permitted by applicable laws and stock exchange regulations, provided the
Offerors Board of Directors five (5) banking days from the date of
publishing or written notice by the Company to the Offeror of the Competing
Offer to enhance the Offer pursuant to this Agreement (the said time period
referred to as the "Enhance Period"); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | upon expiry of the Enhance Period, the Board of Directors of
the Company under its Fiduciary Duties reasonably and in good faith considers,
comparing the consideration and other terms and conditions (including the
availability of financing and the type of consideration) of the Competing
Offer with the Offerors offer as possibly enhanced by the Offeror, that it
would no longer be in the best interest of the shareholders of the Company to
accept the offer made by the Offeror. 
---|---|--- 

If a Competing Offer would be published (or received and notified by the
Company to Offeror in writing as set out above) but Offeror would enhance its
offer pursuant to this Agreement so as to, in the reasonable opinion of the
Board of Directors of the Company rendered in good faith, be at least equally
favourable to the shareholders as the Competing Offer, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall confirm and uphold the Recommendation for the Offer, as
amended.

right to use, license or sell, all other intellectual property as the same is

respective business as presently conducted. No intellectual property used by
