 _THE OFFER AND THE MERGER_

 

Section 2.1. _The Offer_.

 

(a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to use commercially reasonable efforts to, commence
within five (5) Business Days from the date hereof (and in any event Purchaser
shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, commence within ten (10) Business
Days from the date hereof) the Offer within the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC. The obligations of Purchaser to, and of Parent to
cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to (i) there being validly tendered and
not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares
that, together with Shares already owned by Parent and Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates, would represent at least a majority of the Fully
Diluted Shares (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ") and (ii) the
satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Exhibit A_ , as such conditions may be modified in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement. The initial expiration
date of the Offer shall be midnight (New York City time) on the twentieth
(20th) Business Day following commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant
to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange Act). Purchaser expressly reserves the
right in its sole discretion to waive, in whole or in part, any condition to
the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the written
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) reduce the number of Shares
subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive or amend the
Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_
or modify any condition set forth in _Exhibit A_ in any manner adverse to the
Company or the holders of the Shares, (v) except as otherwise provided in
this _Section 2.1(a)_ , extend the Offer or change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer or (vi) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse
to the Company or the holders of the Shares. The parties hereto agree to
cooperate in good faith to modify the terms of the Offer as and if required by
the SEC to the extent such modifications do not materially alter the
Transactions or require any increase to the Offer Price. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall extend the Offer
for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be
required to cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. In
addition, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, if at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of the Offer any
condition to the Offer is not satisfied, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to extend the Offer for one (1) or more consecutive increments
of not more than ten (10) Business Days each (or for such longer period as
may be agreed to by the Company); provided, however, that Purchaser shall not
be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser to, extend
the Offer beyond the Outside Date. On the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, accept and pay for (subject to any withholding of Tax pursuant
to _Section 3.2(e)_ ) all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant
to the Offer promptly after the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended
and re-extended in accordance with this _Section 2.1(a)_ ). Purchaser
expressly reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, following the
Acceptance Time, extend the

 



12  Offer for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions
thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, and the Offer
Documents may, in Purchasers sole discretion, provide for such a reservation
of right. Nothing contained in this _Section 2.1(a_ ) shall affect any
termination rights in _Article VIII_.

 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file
with the SEC, pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and Regulation
M-A under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the
documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
"). Parent and Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and
Purchaser all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act
to be set forth in the Offer Documents or reasonably requested by Parent and
Purchaser for inclusion therein. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect and to correct any material omissions
therein; and each of Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as
so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents,
as so amended or supplemented, to be disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
Federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and
its counsel copies of any written comments, and shall inform the Company and
its counsel of any oral comments or material discussions, that Parent,
Purchaser or their counsel may receive from or engage in with the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments or the commencement or occurrence of any such discussions. Prior to
(i) filing of Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto)
with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company
or (ii) responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer
Documents, in each case, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer
Documents or response (including the proposed final version thereof), and
Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable consideration in good faith to any
comments made by the Company or its counsel.

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(d) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration
thereof without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_. In the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ prior to any
scheduled expiration thereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within two Business Days of
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is
terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser
to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

 



13 (e) Subject to applicable Law, after the Acceptance Time Parent shall be
entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, to serve on the Company Board as will give Purchaser representation on
the Company Board equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on
the Company Board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(e)_ ) and (ii) the percentage that the number of
Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Purchaser (including all Shares
which have been accepted for payment pursuant to _Article III_ ) bears to the
number of Shares outstanding, and upon the request of Parent, the Company
shall promptly increase the size of the Company Board or use its commercially
reasonable efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors,
and to appoint to the Company Board such individuals as designated by Parent
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(e)_ , as is necessary to provide Parent with
such level of representation (the date on which the majority of the Companys
directors are designees of Parent that have been effectively appointed to the
Company Board in accordance herewith, the " _Board Appointment Date_ ").
Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the same
percentage as is on the entire Company Board (after giving effect to this
_Section_ _ _ _2.1(e)_ ) to be on (i) each committee of the Company Board of
the Company and (ii) each board of directors and each committee thereof of
each Company Subsidiary. The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the
Company Board shall be subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act. At the request of Parent, the Company shall promptly take, at
its expense, all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
under the Exchange Act in order to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section_ _ _ _2.1(e)_ and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 or otherwise
timely mail to its stockholders all necessary information to comply therewith.
Parent will supply to the Company, and be solely responsible for, all
information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and Affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the
Board Appointment Date and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms
hereof, any amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company
requiring action by the Company Board, any extension by the Company of the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Purchaser hereunder, or waiver of any of the Companys rights hereunder, in
each case, will require the separate concurrence of a majority of the
directors on the Company Board that were not appointed by Parent.

(f) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Time, the
outstanding Shares shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result
of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, the
Offer Price shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to reflect
such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization.

recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such
date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings, computer files and all other information in the Companys possession
or control regarding the beneficial owners of the Shares, and shall furnish to
Purchaser such information and assistance (including updated lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent,
Purchaser or their agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
the Companys stockholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions,
Parent and Purchaser shall hold in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon
request of the Company, return to the Company or destroy all copies of such
information then in their possession or control.

Section 2.3. _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) Subject to _Sections 2.3(b)_ and _2.3(c)_ , the Company grants to
Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), for so long as
this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof, to
purchase from the Company that number of Shares equal to the number of Shares
that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option and
following any "subsequent offering period", constitutes at least one Share
more than ninety percent (90%) of the Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis
that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Shares to be
issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option (such Shares to be issued upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option, the " _Top-Up Shares_ ").

 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised, in whole but not in part, following
the Acceptance Time; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable (i) to
the extent that the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option would exceed the number of authorized but unissued Shares that are
not reserved or otherwise committed to be issued, (ii) if any Law or Judgment
then in effect shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
delivery of the Top-Up Shares and (iii) unless Purchaser has accepted for
payment all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. The Top-
Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (x) the Effective Time
and (y) valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_.
The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares being purchased by
Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the
number of such Top-Up Shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such
purchase price may be paid by Purchaser, at its election, either (A) entirely
in cash or (B) by paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the
aggregate par value of such Top-Up Shares and by executing and delivering to
the Company a

 



16  promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of such
purchase price. Any such promissory note shall be fully secured by the Top-Up
Shares (to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law), shall be full
recourse against Parent and Purchaser, shall bear interest at the rate of two
percent (2%) per annum, shall mature on the first (1st) anniversary of the
date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid
without premium or penalty. Without the prior written consent of the Company,
the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement may
be exercised only once and shall not be assigned by Purchaser other than to
Parent or a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law
or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the Company. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this _Section 2.3(b)_ shall be null and void.

 

(c) In the event that Purchaser elects to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Purchaser shall deliver to the Company written notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_
") setting forth (i) the number of Shares that Parent and Purchaser own
immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, (ii) the manner in
which Purchaser intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii) the
place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares by
Purchaser is to take place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an
undertaking signed by Parent and Purchaser that, as soon as practicable
following such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall consummate the
Merger in accordance with the Nevada Merger Law. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to
Purchaser specifying the number of Shares then outstanding and, based on the
information provided by Purchaser in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares.
At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and Purchaser
shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be
delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Purchaser the Top-Up Shares. The parties hereto agree to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed
received by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.4_ , and if not so consummated
on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties hereto further
agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be
consummated in accordance with NRS 92A.180, subject to other applicable Laws,
as close in time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the
same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. Parent, Purchaser and the
Company shall cooperate to ensure that any issuance of the Top-Up Shares is
accomplished in a manner consistent with all applicable Laws.

 

(d) Parent and Purchaser understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of
Parent and Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that Purchaser is,
and will be upon any exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited investor"
as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
Each of Parent and Purchaser represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up
Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Purchaser for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection
with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. Any
certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required by
applicable securities Laws.

 



17 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company, as among and between one another, agrees and
acknowledges that, in any proceeding under the Dissenters Rights Statutes
with respect to Dissenting Shares, the fair value of the Dissenting Shares
shall be determined in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Statutes
without regard to the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Shares or any cash or
promissory note delivered by Purchaser to the Company as consideration
therefor, and the Surviving Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up
Option, the Top-Up Shares or any cash or promissory note delivered by
Purchaser to the Company in payment for such Top-Up Shares shall be considered
in connection with the determination of the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Statutes.

Section 2.4. _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, (a) Purchaser shall be merged with and into
the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Nevada Merger Law, and
the separate existence of Purchaser shall cease and (b) the Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and
shall continue its corporate existence under the NPCL. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
NPCL and the Nevada Merger Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all property, rights,
powers, privileges and franchises of Purchaser shall vest in the Company as
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the Effective
Time, take any action (including executing and delivering any document) in
the name and on behalf of either the Company or Purchaser in order to carry
out and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Surviving Corporation shall thereafter be responsible and liable for all
the liabilities and obligations of the Company and Purchaser. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Parent, Purchaser or any
other Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent shall collectively own at least one
Share more than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares, following the
satisfaction or waiver (by the parties hereto) of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ , Parent and the Company hereby agree to take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective, without a meeting
of the holders of the Shares, in accordance with NRS 92A.180 as promptly as
practicable.

 

Section 2.5. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P., 98 San Jacinto Blvd.,
Austin, Texas 78701, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date designated by the
Company which is reasonably satisfactory to Parent, which shall be as soon as
practicable, but not later than two (2) Business Days, after satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature must be satisfied on the Closing Date), or at
such other place, time and date as the parties hereto shall agree. The date
on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing
Date_."

Section 2.6.  _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser and the Company shall cause the Merger to
be consummated by filing all necessary documentation, including the Articles
of Merger, with the Secretary of State as provided in the relevant provisions
of the Nevada Merger Law. The Merger shall become effective at the time that
the Articles are duly filed with the Secretary of State, or such later date
and time as is agreed upon by the parties hereto and specified in the
Articles of Merger, subject to any applicable restrictions in the Nevada
Merger Law. The time when the Merger becomes effective is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Effective Time_."

 



18 Section 2.7. _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, (a) the Company Articles shall be the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in a form
substantially identical to the bylaws of Purchaser at the Effective Time, in
each case, until thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law (subject to _Section 6.7(b)_ hereof).

 

Section 2.8. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Purchaser and the officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors and
officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the NPCL and the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.9. _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further
deeds, assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or
desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of the Company or (b) otherwise carry out
the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors
shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable
power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or
assurances in Law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions
of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
are authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all
such action.

 

Section 2.10. _Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if the adoption of
this Agreement by the Companys stockholders at a meeting of stockholders is
required by Law (including if the conditions to the Top-Up Option are not
satisfied or if the Top-Up Option is for any reason deemed to be invalid or
unenforceable), the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall take
the following actions:

(i) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time, and in
consultation with Parent, Purchaser and their counsel, prepare and file with
the SEC a preliminary proxy statement or preliminary information statement, as
applicable (such proxy statement or information statement, as amended and
supplemented, the " _Proxy/Information Statement_ ") relating to the Merger
and this Agreement and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
furnish the information required to be included by the Exchange Act in the
Proxy/Information Statement and, after consultation with Parent, Purchaser
and their counsel, to respond promptly to, and attempt to resolve, any
comments received from the SEC with respect to the preliminary
Proxy/Information Statement and cause to be mailed to the Companys 

 



19  stockholders a definitive Proxy/Information Statement, a copy of this
Agreement or a summary thereof and take all actions necessary to (x) comply
with the Dissenters Rights Statutes (including, without limitation, the
notice requirements set forth in NRS 92A.410) and (y) subject to the proviso
in _Section 2.10(a)(ii)_ , obtain the necessary approval of this Agreement by
its stockholders;

 

(ii) include in the Proxy/Information Statement the recommendation referred to
in _Section 4.3(b_ ); _provided_ , _however_ , that such recommendation may
be withdrawn, modified or amended, in each case (x) in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 6.2(c)_ or (y) other than in connection with an
Alternative Proposal, if the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; and

 

(iii) as soon as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the
Proxy/Information Statement by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Stockholders 
Meeting_") for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be permitted
to delay or postpone convening the Stockholders Meeting if the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(b) Parent and Purchaser shall in the case of a Stockholders Meeting, cause
all Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and all other Shares owned by
Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates to be voted in favor of the
approval of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Company, Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of any Proxy/Information Statement required hereunder. Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon the Proxy/Information Statement prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC, and the Company shall not file any preliminary or definitive
Proxy/Information Statement, or amendment or supplement thereto, without
providing Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably considered in
good faith by the Company). The Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and
their counsel, promptly after receipt thereof, with copies of any written
comments or other material communications the Company or its counsel receives
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy/Information Statement, and with copies of any written responses to and
telephonic notification of any material verbal responses received from the SEC
or its staff by the Company or its counsel with respect to
the Proxy/Information Statement. If at any time prior to the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders the Company shall
become aware of the occurrence of any event or other circumstance relating to
it or any of the Company Subsidiaries as to which an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy/Information Statement shall be required, the Company shall
promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such amendment or supplement.
The Company shall not mail the Proxy/Information Statement, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, without reasonable advance consultation with Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel.

 



20 (d) The Company agrees that the information relating to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries contained in the Proxy/Information Statement, or in any
other document filed in connection with this Agreement or any of the
Transactions with any other Governmental Entity (to the extent such
information was provided by the Company for inclusion therein), at the
respective times that the applicable document is filed with the SEC or such
other Governmental Entity and (if applicable) first mailed or otherwise
disseminated to stockholders of the Company and, in addition, in the case of
the Proxy/Information Statement, at the date it or any amendment or
supplement thereto is mailed to the Companys stockholders and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 

(e) Parent shall provide the Company with the information concerning Parent,
Purchaser and their respective Affiliates required to be included in the
Proxy/Information Statement. Parent agrees that the information relating to
Parent, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates contained in the
Proxy/Information Statement, or in any other document filed in connection with
this Agreement or any of the Transactions with any other Governmental Entity
(to the extent such information was provided by Parent or Purchaser for
inclusion therein), at the respective times that the applicable document is
filed with the SEC or such other Governmental Entity and first mailed or
otherwise disseminated to stockholders of the Company and, in addition, in the
case of the Proxy/Information Statement, at the date it or any amendment or
supplement thereto is mailed to the Companys stockholders and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

Section 2.11. _Repayment of Company Credit Agreement Indebtedness, Etc_. At
the Closing, the Company and the Parent each shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the repayment in full of all liabilities and obligations in respect of
all then-outstanding indebtedness under the Company Credit Agreement, the
extinguishment and release all of liabilities and obligations under the
Company Credit Agreement and all other documents and instruments in connection
therewith and the release of any and all Liens and guarantees in connection
therewith. Parent shall provide Purchaser with sufficient funds to pay for all
Shares to be acquired in the Merger and the repayment of such indebtedness and
related obligations. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver all notices
and take other actions required to facilitate (a) repayment in full of all
obligations in respect of such indebtedness (including the principal balance
outstanding together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon) on or prior
to the Closing Date and (b) the release of any Liens and guarantees in
connection therewith on or prior to the Closing Date. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the Company, or the applicable Company
Subsidiary, shall deliver to Parent, on the last day prior to the expiration
of the Offer and at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or
such later date as Parent may agree in writing, but in any event, on or prior
to the Closing Date), payoff letters (the " _Payoff Letters_ "), in
substantially final form and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, from all financial institutions and other Persons to which such
Company Credit Agreement indebtedness is owed, or the applicable agent,
trustee or other representative on behalf of such Persons. In connection with
this prepayment, Parent and the Company shall take all actions necessary to
exercise and fulfill the terms of the "Call Option" set forth in Section 3(c)
of the Forbearance Agreement in order to achieve payment in full under the
Company Credit Agreement on the best possible terms to the Company.

 



21 ARTICLE III

 

 _CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_

 

Section 3.1. _Conversion of Capital Stock_ __. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Purchaser or any holder of any share of capital stock of the Company,
Parent or Purchaser:

(a) _Common Stock of Purchaser_ __. Each share of common stock, no par value
per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become that number of validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation necessary to cause the number
of outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Merger to be equal to the number of outstanding Shares immediately before the
Merger.

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_ __. All Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of
Parent, Purchaser and any other Subsidiary of Parent, and all Shares held in
the treasury of the Company or owned by any Company Subsidiary, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Shares_ __.

 

(i) _Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares and any Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ _)_ shall be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price in cash, payable to the holder thereof in
accordance with this _Article III_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon
surrender and exchange of a Certificate.

(ii) _Cancellation_. All such Shares when so converted shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing Shares that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such outstanding Share (other than
any Dissenting Shares) (a " _Certificate_ " ) and each non-certificated Share
represented by book-entry (other than any Dissenting Shares) (a " _Book Entry
Share_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section 3.2_.

 

(d) _Certain Adjustments_ __. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if, at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of Shares shall
occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares)
with a record date during such period, then the applicable Merger
Consideration payable under _Section 3.1(c)_ in respect of such Shares shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 



22 Section 3.2. _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_ __. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") to receive, for the benefit of the Company stockholders, funds
representing the aggregate Merger Consideration to which Company stockholders
shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and for the purpose of
exchanging the Merger Consideration for Certificates or Book Entry Shares. The
Paying Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company stockholders for the
purpose of holding the Certificates and shall obtain no rights or interests
in the shares represented by such Certificates. At such times as the Paying
Agent shall require, but no earlier than two days before the Paying Agent must
pay the Merger Consideration, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of holders of Certificates
or Book Entry Shares, funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable upon conversion of Shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_
(such funds being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For
purposes of determining the aggregate amount to be so deposited, Parent shall
assume that no stockholder of the Company shall perfect any right to appraisal
of his, her or its Shares under the Dissenters Rights Statutes. If for any
reason (including losses) such funds are inadequate to pay all amounts to
which holders of Shares shall be entitled under _Section 3.1(c)_ , Parent
shall promptly deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit
additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required
under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any
event be liable for payment thereof. Such funds shall not be used for any
purpose other than as set forth in this _Article III_ , and shall be invested
by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation solely
in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations
for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged
to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper
rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and Poors Corporation, or (iv) a combination of any of the
foregoing. Parent shall bear and pay all charges and expenses, including those
of the Paying Agent, incurred in connection with the exchange of shares and
the Exchange Fund. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments will be payable to Purchaser or Parent, as
Parent directs.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_ __. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any
event not more than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares representing Shares
which were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ , (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Shares, only upon proper delivery of such Certificate to
the Paying Agent, or receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" with
respect to Book Entry Shares, which letter shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of each such Certificate or
Book Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the total amount of Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other

 



23  documents reasonably requested by the Paying Agent the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration (subject to subsection (e) of this  _Section 3.2_ ) for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Shares, and the
Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
If payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
transferred Book Entry Shares is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment of such Merger Consideration that either (i) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book Entry Share shall be properly transferred, in each
case, as determined by the Paying Agent and as set forth in the letter of
transmittal and related instructions and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid to the Paying Agent in advance any Tax required by
reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or Book Entry Shares surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.2_ , each Certificate and Book Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive, in cash, the Merger Consideration for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Share as contemplated
by this _Section 3.2_. No interest will be paid or accrue upon the cash
payable upon the surrender of Certificates.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_ __. After the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. After the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book
Entry Shares evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law and, without
limitation of the foregoing, subject to the Surviving Corporations obligation
to pay any and all dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Time
which may have been declared by the Company on Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article III_.

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_ __. At any time following six (6)
months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying
Agent for the payment of Merger Consideration and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, which shall thereafter act as the Paying Agent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law), as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book Entry Shares, as determined
pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder
of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



24 (e) _Withholding Taxes_ __. The right of any Person to receive payment
or consideration payable upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will be subject to any applicable
requirements with respect to the withholding of any Tax and each of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled, without
duplication, to deduct and withhold such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold under applicable Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, (i) such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book Entry Shares in respect of which
the deduction and withholding was made and (ii) Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, to promptly
pay over such withheld amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_ __. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the
delivery by such Person of a bond (in such amount as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation on account
of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the total amount of Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as
determined in accordance with this _Article III_.

 

Section 3.3. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who
shall have complied with the provisions of the Dissenters Rights Statutes
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, and holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of the Dissenters
Rights Statutes, unless and until the applicable holder fails to comply with

together with the acceptance of the payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
shall be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and for applicable

reserves set forth therein and in any supplement thereto or update thereof,
each of which has been furnished or made available to Parent, was accurate in
all material respects, and to the Companys Knowledge, no material errors in
such information existed at the time such information was provided. Except

addressed in the Company Reserve Report that would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Set forth in _Section 4.9 _ of the Companys Disclosure

consultants that relate to any Benefit Plan. (For all purposes of this
_Section 4.13(c)_ , the reference to the Company having made a document
"available" to Parent shall be deemed to include the Company having made such
document publicly available by filing it (or incorporating it by reference) as
an exhibit to the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year

Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) will (i) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Benefit Plan, (ii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits, or (iii) result in any payment (whether
severance pay or otherwise) becoming due to, or with respect to, any current
or former employee or director of the Company. Except as set forth in
_Section 4.13(g_ ) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is a party to any contract, arrangement or agreement
with any employee, director, or consultant providing for payments that could

or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA or a violation of Section 406 of ERISA.

 

(i) All Company Stock Options, Restricted Shares and rights to receive Change

which have been exercised as of the date of this Agreement, was) at least
equal to the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock, as
determined in accordance with applicable Laws (including, to the extent
applicable, Section 409A of the Code), on the date the Company Stock Option
was granted. The Company has properly accounted for all Company Stock Options,

clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this _Section 6.2(c)_ , the Company shall
(x) give Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice (the "
_Notice Period_ ") thereof, which notice shall state that the Company has
received a Superior Proposal, include a copy of all relevant documents
relating to the Superior Proposal and a written summary of the material terms
and conditions of the Superior Proposal not made in writing and the identity
of the Person or "group" making the Superior Proposal, which notice need only
be given once with respect to any Superior Proposal, unless such Superior
Proposal is modified in any material respect (which includes any revision in
price whatsoever) in which case a new Notice Period will begin (it being
understood that there may be multiple extensions) and (y) promptly provide
Parent with a list of any nonpublic information concerning the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and the present or future financial
condition or results of operations thereof, provided to any third party, and,
to the extent such information has not been previously provided to Parent,
copies of such information, (B) during the Notice Period, the Company shall
have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith with
respect to any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would permit the Company Board not to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
and (C) following the Notice Period the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) after taking into account any such modifications, changes or
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent (taking into
account, among other things, (I) the terms of such offer and (II) such legal,
financial, regulatory, timing, financing, conditionality (i.e. closing
conditions) and other aspects of such offer which the Company Board deems
relevant), that (x) failure to effect the Adverse Recommendation
Change action still would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (y) if the
intended Adverse Recommendation Change is the result of a Superior Proposal,
the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even
if such changes were to be given effect.

 



55 Section 6.3. _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a press release reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect,
none of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates shall issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with
respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
Transactions without the prior written approval of the Company and Parent, as
the case may be, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement
with a securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party wanting to make such release or announcement; _provided_ , that no party
hereto shall be required to obtain the prior written approval of another
party in connection with any press release or public announcement in
connection with the Company Board making an Adverse Recommendation Change or
having resolved to do so. Each of Parent and the Company may make any public
statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls,
so long as such statements are substantially similar to previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and
the Company (or individually, if approved by the other party).

Section 6.4. _Access to Information_.

(a) During the period prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall afford to
the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives of
Parent access to senior executives of the Company to answer Parents questions
concerning the business, operations and affairs of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and access to the Companys and each of the Company
Subsidiaries properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, in each
case, as reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , that in each case, such
access shall be given at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice and
Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business, operations or
personnel of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_
, that such access shall not include any sampling or testing of any soil,
air, water, groundwater or any other media or material other than with the
Companys prior approval (which approval may be denied in the Companys sole
and absolute discretion) or with the approval of Republic in connection with
the Republic Transaction to conduct such sampling or testing. From the date
hereof until this Agreement is terminated, Parent and Purchaser shall be
provided, at the Companys corporate office location, such office space as is
reasonably requested by Parent for its Representatives to have access to the
books and records and, subject to _Section 6.4(b)_ the employees, of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, such access
shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable access to, and cooperation
from, the Companys information technology systems and, subject to _Section
6.4(b)_ , employees to permit the integration of such systems with those of
Parents and Purchasers own systems.

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, all requests for access shall be
made to such Representatives of the Company as it shall designate, who shall
be solely responsible for coordinating all such requests and access
thereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to,
contact or otherwise communicate with the respective employees of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries regarding the businesses of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, this Agreement or any of the Transactions without first
obtaining the reasonable consent of the Company in writing.

 



56 (c) The Company makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any
information provided pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _6.4(a)_ , and neither
Purchaser nor Parent may rely on the accuracy of any such information, other
than as expressly set forth in the Companys representations and warranties in
_Article IV_.

(d) The information provided pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_ will be used solely
for the purpose of effecting the Transactions and will be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.5. _Further Assurances; Regulatory Matters_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) reasonable best
efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed
on such party with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions and, subject to the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , to
consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable and (ii) promptly to
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, all necessary Permits of all Governmental Entities
necessary or advisable in connection with consummating the Transactions,
including the Company Required Governmental Approvals and Parent Required
Governmental Approval. Parent and Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Affiliates of Parent and Purchaser to, vote all shares of Common
Stock beneficially owned by them (including all Shares which have been
accepted for payment pursuant to _Article III_ ) in favor of adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger at any stockholders meeting at which adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger is voted upon.

Section 6.6. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to honor and perform in
accordance with their terms all of the Benefit Plans, subject to the right to
amend or terminate such arrangements in accordance with their terms.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of the date immediately preceding
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to terminate,
and shall cause to be terminated, any Benefit Plan intended to be compliant
with Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ").

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, for at
least one (1) year following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries with compensation (including base
salary or wages and incentive compensation opportunities) and employee
benefits (other than severance benefits as described in _Section 6.6(d)_ )
which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable to such employee than the
compensation and employee benefits (excluding any equity based compensation or
benefits) provided by Parent to similarly situated employees.

 



57 (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) credit all service with the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries (including service recognized by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries for service with other Persons) for all purposes
(other than benefit accrual under a "defined benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(35) of ERISA) under any employee benefit plan, policy or program
including, without limitation, any severance benefits arrangement, or vacation
or other paid time off policy, applicable to employees of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing, (ii) waive any
waiting period, pre-existing condition or limitation or exclusion and any
actively-at-work requirement with respect to employees of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries and their dependents under any group health plan
or other welfare benefit plan, and (iii) recognize the dollar amount of all
expenses incurred by employees of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and their dependents in the plan year in which such employees
begin to participate in a group health plan of Parent or any of Parents
Subsidiaries for purposes of deductibles, co-payments and maximum out-of-
pocket limits under any such group health plan.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, pay severance benefits to persons who were employees of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and
whose employment with the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is terminated for reasons other than misconduct
within one (1) year following the Effective Time in amounts in accordance
with the amount of severance benefits set forth _Section 6.6(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, with such payment to be contingent upon the
employees timely execution (without revocation) of a waiver and release of
all employment-related claims.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 6.6_ , the
parties expressly acknowledge and agree that: (i) nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed or construed to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries to continue to employ any particular
employee for any period after Closing; (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent,
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries; and (iii)
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to limit the right of
Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries to
terminate the employment of any employee during any period after Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express or
implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Benefit
Plan, or shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any employee benefit
plan or arrangement sponsored by Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date.

 



58 Section 6.7. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to), indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under the NPCL or other applicable Law, each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (individually, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ," and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and disbursements), obligations (including experts fees, travel
expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and
binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges),
fines, liabilities, judgments, and amounts that are paid in settlement with
the approval of the indemnifying party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (collectively, " _Indemnified
Liabilities_ "), paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending,
serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in (and
including preparation for any of the foregoing) any pending, threatened,
asserted or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or
investigation (including, without limitation, any action brought by an
Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.7_ , any action on appeal, or any
arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism), whether civil
or criminal, and whether instituted by the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
any Governmental Entity or any other party, (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") to the
extent such Proceeding arises out of or pertains to (i) any action or
omission or obligation or omission in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a
director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) acts or omissions occurring in connection with this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after, the Effective Time. In the event that any claim for Indemnified
Liabilities is asserted or made by an Indemnified Party, any determination
required to be made with respect to whether such Indemnified Partys conduct
complies with the standards set forth under the NPCL or other applicable Law
shall be made by independent legal counsel mutually agreeable to Parent and
such Indemnified Party. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, advance (within thirty (30) days of receipt of written request) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of each Indemnified Party in
connection with any Proceeding as such expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) are incurred upon receipt from such
Indemnified Party of a request therefor (accompanied by invoices or other
relevant documentation); _provided_  (if and to the extent required by the
NPCL or other applicable Law) that such Indemnified Party undertakes to repay
such amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified under the NPCL or other applicable Law with
respect to such Proceeding. In the event any Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Party (and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall each
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of such
matter; _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in such
Proceeding without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party if and
to the extent the terms of the proposed settlement, compromise or judgment
involve any non-monetary relief from such Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law
firm to represent them with respect to each matter unless there is, under
application standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any material
issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

(b) All rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in
favor of, and all exculpations and limitations of the personal liability of,
the directors, officers and employees of any of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in the Company Articles or Company By-Laws (or comparable
organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries) 

 



59  as in effect as of the Effective Time with respect to matters occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, including the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect thereafter, without any amendment thereto. The Surviving Corporation
shall not, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, distribute
or dispose of assets in a manner that would render the Surviving Corporation
unable to satisfy any of its obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.7_.

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect the
current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by
or for the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries for the benefit of those
Persons who are covered by such policies as of the Effective Time with respect
to claims arising in whole or in part from matters occurring or allegedly
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are at least
as beneficial to the beneficiaries of the current policies and with reputable
carriers having an A.M. Best rating comparable to the Companys current
carrier); _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, first use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain a "tail" policy on terms and conditions at least as beneficial in
the aggregate for claims arising out of acts or conduct occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time and effective for claims asserted prior to or during the
six (6)-year period referred to above (and, with respect to claims made prior
to or during such period, until final resolution thereof), and only if Parent
and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries are unable, after exerting
commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain such a "tail" policy, then Parent
or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be required to obtain
such coverage from such carriers in annual policies; and, _provided_ ,
_further_ that (i) if the existing policies expire or are terminated or
cancelled during such six (6)-year period, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions that are at least as beneficial to the beneficiaries of the
current policies with reputable carriers having an A.M. Best rating comparable
to the Companys current carrier, (ii) Parent or the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall not be required to spend as an
annual premium therefor an amount in excess of 175% of the premium therefor as
of the date of this Agreement and (iii) if, during such six (6)-year period,
such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all or can be obtained only for
an amount in excess of 175% of the current annual premium therefor, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained as much directors
and officers liability insurance coverage as can be obtained for an amount
equal to 175% of the current annual premium therefor, on terms and conditions
that are at least as beneficial to the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries existing directors and officers liability insurance.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the Effective Time the Company shall be permitted to purchase prepaid "tail"
policies in favor of the individuals referred to in _Section 6.7(c)_ with
respect to the matters described therein (provided that the premium therefor
shall not exceed 175% of the annual premium therefor as of the date of this
Agreement). If and to the extent such policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policies in effect and continue to honor the obligations of the
Company thereunder.

 



60 (e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
perform in accordance with their terms all indemnification agreements in
effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company, on the one hand,
and any director or officer of the Company, on the other hand.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person who is now, or who has
been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, an Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
personal representatives, (ii) shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and their respective successors and assigns, (iii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have, whether pursuant to Law,
Contract, any Benefit Plan, the Company Articles or Company By-Laws (or
comparable organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation), or otherwise and (iv) shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified
Party.

(g) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or permitted assigns (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of such Indemnifying Party assume all the
obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 6.7_. In
addition, if upon or following any merger, consolidation or sale of assets any
Indemnifying Party is or becomes a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another
Person, the ultimate parent entity of such Indemnifying Party shall guaranty
the obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 6.7_.

 

Section 6.8. _Obligations of Parent and Purchaser_. Prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1_ :

engaging in the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger and the other

obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

(c) Parent and Purchaser shall not (and Parent shall cause the other
Affiliates of Parent not to) engage in any action or enter into any
transaction or permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered into
that could reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the consummation of,
or otherwise adversely affect, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or
any of the other Transactions (including the financing thereof).

 



61 Section 6.9. _Defense of Litigation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall control, and the Company shall,
subject to such limitations as counsel to the Company reasonably determines
are necessary or desirable to protect any attorney-client privilege of the
Company, give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any
litigation brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company and/or
its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not settle or offer to settle
any claim, action, suit, charge, investigation or proceeding against the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors
or officers by any stockholder of the Company arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Company shall not cooperate with any
Person that may seek to restrain, enjoin, prohibit or otherwise oppose the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall, subject
to such limitations as counsel to the Company reasonably determines are
necessary or desirable to protect any attorney-client privilege of the
Company, cooperate with Parent and Purchaser in resisting any such effort
to restrain, enjoin, prohibit or otherwise oppose such transactions. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume control
of any of the foregoing matters from and after the Closing Date.

 

(b) In connection with this Agreement, the Company and Parent acknowledge that
they share common legal interests with respect to the Abcouwer Matters. As a
result of these common legal interests, from and after the date hereof until
the Closing Date, Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
participate in, and to retain co-counsel (at Parents sole cost and
expense) with respect to, the Abcouwer Matters. Parent and Parents counsel
shall be informed in advance of all matters of significance in the Abcouwer
Matters and any actions taken in the Abcouwer Matters shall require the joint
approval of the Company and Parent. If, in the reasonable opinion of Parent,
the Company or its counsel fails to diligently defend or pursue such Abcouwer
Matters, Parent shall be entitled to assume control of the Abcouwer Matters.
The Company and its counsel shall cooperate with Parent and Parents counsel
in all reasonable respects in connection with the Abcouwer Matters, and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any actions taken in respect
of the Abcouwer Matters shall require the joint approval of the Company and
Parent pursuant to the Joint Defense Agreement.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall assume control of the Abcouwer
Matters from and after the Closing Date.

eliminate or minimize the effects of such takeover statute or Law.

Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof with any officer, director or
employee that holds Shares pursuant to which compensation is paid to such
officer, director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule

of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the
Exchange Act.

Section 6.12. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions

from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.13. _Notices of Certain Events_. The Company shall notify Parent
and Purchaser, and Parent and Purchaser shall notify the Company, promptly of

inaccurate in any material respect, or the material failure of any party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement in this Agreement,

not be satisfied or would give rise to a right a termination set forth in
_Section 8.1(e)_. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent and Purchaser
promptly of any change or event having, or which is reasonably likely to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or which would reasonably be likely to
result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ to be
satisfied. In no event shall (x) the delivery of any notice by a party hereto
pursuant to this _Section 6.13_ limit or otherwise affect the respective
rights, obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of

this Agreement), which shall survive any termination of this Agreement) shall

this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement that has been

_Section 8.1(b)(ii_ ), or by Parent pursuant to _Sections 8.1(e)(_ _i_ _)_ or
_8.1(e)(ii)_ , and (C) within one (1) year from the date of such termination
of this Agreement, the Company consummates such Alternative Proposal; 
_provided_ , that, for

 



66  purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ , "Alternative Proposal" shall have the
meaning ascribed in _Section 1.1_ except that references to "20%" shall be
replaced by "50%"; (ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_ , or (iii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)(iv)_ or _Section 8.1(f)_ , then the Company shall pay to
Parent the amount of $4,000,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ") pursuant
to _Section 8.3(b)_ below.

(b) The Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent, by wire transfer of
same day funds, at or prior to the time of termination, in the case of such
termination by the Company, or as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days of receipt of Parents termination notice
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ ), in the case of such termination by Parent. Except
to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall not withhold any
withholding Taxes from any payment made pursuant to this _Section 8.3_.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and
Purchaser agree that (i) payment of the Termination Fee, if such payment is
payable and actually paid, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and Purchaser against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of
the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries respective former, current or
future Representatives, stockholders or Affiliates for monetary damages
and (ii) none of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries respective former, current or future
Representatives, stockholders or Affiliates shall have any liability or
obligation, in any such case (clause (i) or (ii)) relating to, arising out of
or with respect to this Agreement or any of the Transactions (whether relating
to, arising out of or with respect to any matter(s) forming the basis for such
termination or otherwise), in each case, other than in the event of fraud or
willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, none of Parent,
Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any proceeding, claim, suit or action against,
or seek damages from, the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any
other Person referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, in contravention of the
preceding sentence. Under no circumstances shall the Company Termination Fee
be payable more than once.

of the parties hereto by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company,
no amendment, modification or supplement shall be made that changes the

rights of the Companys stockholders under this Agreement or that otherwise
requires further approval of stockholders under applicable Law without the

part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when each party has received counterparts signed by

shall constitute valid and sufficient delivery thereof.

Section 9.6. _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,

the Confidentiality Agreement: (i) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,

negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Article VII_
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 



69 Section 9.7. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall in no
way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any
term, provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, illegal, void,
unenforceable or against regulatory policy, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in
order that the Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

Section 9.8. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Nevada that apply to
agreements made and performed entirely within the State of Nevada, without
regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof or of any other
jurisdiction.

 

Section 9.9. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the parties

without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be null and void _ab_ _initio_.

 

Section 9.10. _Schedules_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, disclosure set forth under one Section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in any other Section or Sections of
the Company Disclosure Schedule where the applicability of such disclosure
would be relevant or applicable to the extent such relevance or
applicability is reasonably apparent on its face. It is understood and agreed
that (a) nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the
scope of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement and (b) the fact that any information is disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that such information is
required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
the information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the dollar
thresholds set forth in this Agreement, shall not be used as a basis for
interpreting the terms "material" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or
other similar terms in this Agreement.

 

Section 9.11. _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
whether or not the Offer and the Merger are consummated, all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by any party to this Agreement or on its behalf in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions expressly contemplated by

or any of the Transactions shall be brought and determined in the courts of
the Eighth Judicial District of the State of Nevada (Clark County, Nevada) or,
if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over the matter is vested in
the federal courts, in any federal court located in Clark County, Nevada, and
each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser hereby irrevocably submits with
regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding, (i) any claim that it
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for
any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (ii) that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (x) such action, suit or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the
venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper and (z) this Agreement,
the Transactions or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced
in or by such courts.

(b) Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may
arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult
issues and, therefore, each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the Transactions. Each party hereto certifies and acknowledges that (i)
no representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing waiver in the
event of any such legal action, suit or proceeding, (ii) such party has
considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) such party makes this waiver
voluntarily and (iv) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this
_Section 9.12(b)_.

Section 9.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that each of the parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that it shall not
oppose the granting of such relief; (ii) hereby irrevocably waives any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with such
relief (it is understood that clause (i) of this sentence is not intended to,
and shall not, preclude any party hereto from litigating on the merits the
substantive claim to which such remedy relates); and (iii) the prevailing
party shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs and expenses including
without limitation, all attorneys fees. The parties hereby further
acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled
to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of, and to prevent or cure breaches of _Section 6.5_ by Parent or Purchaser.

 



71 Section 9.14. _Construction of Agreement_.

 

(a) The terms and provisions of this Agreement represent the results of
negotiations among the parties hereto, each of which has been represented by
counsel of its own choosing, and none of which has acted under duress or
compulsion, whether legal, economic or otherwise. Accordingly, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in
accordance with their usual and customary meanings, and each of the parties
hereto hereby waives the application in connection with the interpretation and
construction of this Agreement of any Law to the effect that ambiguous or
conflicting terms or provisions contained in this Agreement shall be
interpreted or construed against the party whose attorney prepared the
executed draft or any earlier draft of this Agreement.

 

(b) All references in this Agreement to Sections, Articles and Schedules
without further specification are to Sections and Articles of, and Schedules
to, this Agreement.

(c) The Table of Contents and the captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning, interpretation
or construction of any provisions of this Agreement.

(e) The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular
as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as the

respects on and as of the date of determination as if made on such date, (2)
the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.2(a)_ and _4.2(b)_
shall not be true and correct, as of the expiration of the Offer as if made on
such date (except for representations and warranties that expressly speak
only as of a specific date or time what are true and correct as of such date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct as of such dates has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have more than a _de minimis_ effect on the reasonably expected benefits of
the Transactions to the Parent and Purchaser and (3) any of the
representations of the Company set forth in _Article IV_ other than those set
forth in clauses (1) or (2) shall not be true and correct on the expiration

contained therein);

and (c) do not exist;

 

(e) since the date of the Merger Agreement, any fact(s), circumstance(s),
event(s), change(s), effect(s) or occurrence(s) shall have occurred, other
than as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, which has or have had,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

(f) the consummation of the Republic Transaction in accordance with its terms
has not yet occurred;

 

(g) the amounts set forth in the Payoff Letters delivered to Parent on the
last day prior to the expiration of the Offer with respect to the Company
Credit Agreement exceed $142,532,887.75 (except as such amount may be
increased by reasonable professional fees and expenses);

asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise
to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other than
the Minimum Tender Condition), in each case, subject to the terms of
this Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The
failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such
right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed
a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.
