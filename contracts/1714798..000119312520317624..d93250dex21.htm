_Agreement_ "), among Eli Lilly and Company, an Indiana corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Tyto Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and Prevail Therapeutics Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company each
have approved the acquisition of the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and, accordingly, Purchaser has agreed
to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase any (subject to the
Minimum Tender Condition) and all of the issued and outstanding shares (each,
a " _Share_ " and, collectively, " _Shares_ ") of Common Stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), for $22.50
per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest (the " _Closing Amount_
"), plus one contingent value right per share (a " _CVR_ ") which shall
represent the right to receive the Milestone Payment (as such term is used in
the Contingent Value Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as Annex IV
(the " _CVR Agreement_ ") to be entered into between Parent and a trustee
mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company (the " _Trustee_ "), if any, at
the time provided for in the CVR Agreement, net to the seller in cash, without
interest (the Closing Amount plus one CVR, collectively, or any higher amount
per share paid pursuant to the Offer, the " _Offer Price_ ");

WHEREAS, as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer,
Purchaser will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in
accordance with Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), with the Company continuing as the Surviving
Corporation, and each Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Shares described in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_)
will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, net to
the Seller in cash and without interest, upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the
holders of the Shares, (ii) adopted this Agreement and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the holders of the Shares accept the Offer and tender their
Shares pursuant to the Offer;

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Purchaser each have, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, adopted this Agreement
and approved the Contemplated Transactions, including the Offer and the
Merger;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parents and Purchasers willingness to
enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are executing
and delivering a Tender and Support Agreement in favor of Parent and Purchaser
(the " _Tender and Support Agreements_ "), pursuant to which such
stockholders, among other things, will agree to tender all Shares beneficially
owned by them to Purchaser in the Offer; and

   

WHEREAS, Parent, as sole stockholder of Purchaser, will approve this Agreement
immediately following its execution;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

Section 1.1.  _The Offer_.

(a) (i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (and provided
that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with
_Article VIII_ ), Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event
later than December 22, 2020), commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_
")) the Offer to purchase for cash any (subject to the Minimum Tender
Condition) and all Shares at the Offer Price; _provided_ , that if, at the
time Purchaser intends to commence the offer, the Company is not prepared to
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") and to
disseminate to holders of Shares the Schedule 14D-9, Purchaser may, but until
such time as the Company is so prepared, shall not be obligated to, commence
the Offer. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and to pay for
any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
hereunder) of those conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer
Conditions_ "). Unless extended in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.1(a)(ii)_, the Offer will expire at one (1) minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Time on the twentieth (20th) Business Day (calculated as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following (and including the day of) the
commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ "), or, if the
Offer has been extended in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.1(a)(ii)_, at
the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Date, and/or such later time and date to which the Offer has been
extended in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(a)(ii)_, the " _Expiration
Date_ "). Purchaser expressly reserves the right at any time or from time to
time, in its sole discretion, to waive any Offer Condition or modify or amend
the terms of the Offer, in whole or in part, including the Offer Price,
except that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser may
not (A) decrease the Closing Amount or amend the terms of the CVR or the CVR
Agreement, (B) change the form of the consideration payable in the Offer, (C)
decrease the number of Shares sought pursuant to the Offer, (D) amend or waive
the Minimum Tender Condition, (E) add to the conditions set forth on _Annex I_
, (F) modify the conditions set forth on _Annex I_ in a manner adverse to the
holders of Shares, (G) extend the Expiration Date of the Offer except as
required or permitted by _Section_ __ _ 1.1(a)(ii)_ or (H) make any other
change in the terms or conditions of the Offer that is adverse to the holders
of Shares.

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) by Purchaser of the
Offer Conditions as of any scheduled Expiration Date, Purchaser shall accept
for purchase and pay for any and all Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after such scheduled Expiration Date
(the date and time of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ ").

 



-2- 

    

 Purchaser shall not permit holders of Shares to tender Shares pursuant to
the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures. Purchaser shall (A)
extend the Offer for one (1) or more periods of time of up to ten (10)
Business Days per extension if at any scheduled Expiration Date any Offer
Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) is not satisfied and has
not been waived (to the extent permitted hereunder) and (B) extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the SEC, the staff thereof, or The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (" _Nasdaq_ ")
applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , _that_ , Purchaser is not required to
extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. In addition, if at the otherwise
scheduled Expiration Date, each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived and the Minimum Tender
Condition shall not have been satisfied, Purchaser may elect to (and if so
requested by the Company, Purchaser shall) extend the Offer for one or more
consecutive increments of such duration as requested by the Company (or if not
so requested by the Company, as determined by Purchaser), but not more than
(10) ten Business Days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed to by
Parent and the Company); _provided_ , that the Company shall not request
Purchaser to, and Purchaser shall not, extend the Offer pursuant to this
sentence on more than three (3) occasions; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Purchaser shall not without the prior written consent of the Company, and
shall not be required to, extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. The
Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to register) the
transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by Purchaser effective immediately
after the Acceptance Time.

 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file
or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(collectively with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_
") with respect to the Offer that includes as exhibits the offer to purchase
and related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other
ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ ") and shall disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares,
in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Laws. The Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and Purchaser all
information reasonably requested by Parent and Purchaser concerning the
Company and required by applicable federal securities Laws to be set forth in
the Offer Documents. Except from and after a Change of Board Recommendation,
Parent and Purchaser shall (i) afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to their filing with the SEC,
(ii) promptly provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written
comments (and a description of any oral comments) received by Parent,
Purchaser or their counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents, (iii), consult with the Company regarding any such comments
prior to responding thereto and (iv) promptly provide the Company with copies
of any written responses to any such comments. Each of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Offer Documents as well as any material omissions from the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that it has become aware that such information has become
false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Purchaser shall take
all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each
case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws.

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 



-3- 

    

(d) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , Purchaser shall terminate the Offer
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ ), and Purchaser shall not
acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated by
Purchaser, or if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_
prior to the acquisition of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall promptly (and
in any event within two (2) Business Days of such termination) return, and
shall cause any depositary or other agent acting on behalf of Purchaser to
return, in accordance with applicable Law, all Shares tendered into the Offer
to the registered holders thereof.

(e) The (i) Offer Price and (ii) Merger Consideration will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect any reclassification, recapitalization, division or
subdivision of shares, consolidation of shares, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution occurring (or for which a record date
is established) or other similar transaction after the date of this Agreement
and prior to (A) the payment by Purchaser for Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn in connection with the Offer (with respect to the Offer
Price) or (B) the Effective Time (with respect to the Merger Consideration).

 

(f) Parent shall, and shall cause the Trustee to, at or prior to the
Acceptance Time, duly authorize, execute and deliver the CVR Agreement. 

Section 1.2. _Company Consent; Schedule 14D-9_.

 

(a) On the date of the filing of the Offer Documents, the Company shall file
with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_") containing, subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Company
Board Recommendation and provided, that the Company shall not be obligated to
make such filing prior to December 22, 2020. The Company shall include in the

Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and (y) the fairness opinion delivered by
Centerview Partners LLC (together with a description of such firms related

date for the purpose of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of
the DGCL;  _provided_ , _that_ , such record date will not be more than ten
(10) calendar days prior to the date that the Schedule 14D-9 is first mailed.
The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents and, absent a Change of Board
Recommendation, to the inclusion of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with the
Offer Documents mailed or furnished to the holders of Shares. Parent and
Purchaser shall, absent a Change of Board Recommendation, disseminate a copy

correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that it has become aware that such information has become false
or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with

Shares. Except for such actions as are reasonably necessary to disseminate the

Section 3.2. _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) The Company Board (or, if appropriate, the committee administering a
Company equity incentive plan, inducement award program or other similar
plan, program or arrangement under which equity incentive awards are
outstanding, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company 2017 Equity
Incentive Plan and the Company 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (each, a " _Company
Equity Plan_ " and, collectively, the " _Company Equity Plans_ ")) has
adopted, or, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and,
in any event, prior to the Effective Time), shall adopt, resolutions providing
that, and has taken or shall take other necessary action providing that:

(i) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares granted under a
Company Equity Plan (other than the Companys 2019 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ")) (each such option, a " _Company Stock Option_
") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not vested, will be cancelled, and, in exchange therefor, the holder of such
cancelled Company Stock Option will be entitled to receive (without interest),
in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Stock Option, (x) an
amount in cash (less applicable tax withholdings pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.6_) equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(B) the excess, if any, of the Closing Amount over the applicable exercise
price per Share under such Company Stock Option and (y) one (1) CVR for each
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock

(the " _Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ , that any Company Stock Option
that has an exercise price that equals or exceeds the Closing Amount shall be
cancelled for no consideration;

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Share of Company Restricted Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted, at the

terms and conditions that apply to the receipt of the Merger Consideration by
holders of Shares generally;

 



-7- 

    

(iii) subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.6_, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to make all payments to former holders of Company Stock
Options and Company Restricted Stock required under _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time or the Milestone Payment
Date, as applicable, and, in any event, no later than the next regularly
scheduled payroll date that follows (x) with respect to the Closing Amount,

commence following the date hereof unless and until this Agreement is
terminated; and (B) the Company ESPP shall terminate as of or prior to the
Effective Time.

Section 3.3. _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not
be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration unless such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his, her,
or its right to appraisal. Instead, at the Effective Time, the Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and from and after the Effective Time, a holder of
Shares who has properly exercised appraisal rights will not have any rights of
a stockholder of the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Shares, except those provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of
Dissenting Shares will be entitled only to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after
the Effective Time, such holder effectively withdraws or loses his, her, or
its right to appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, in which
case such Dissenting Shares will be treated as if such Shares had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon and less any applicable tax
withholding, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates, pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_.

 

(b) The Company shall provide Parent with prompt written notice of any demands
for appraisal (including copies of any written demands), withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments received by the Company from holders of
Shares relating to rights of appraisal, and Parent will have the opportunity
and right to direct the conduct of all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal. Except with the prior written consent
of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
appraisal.

Section 3.4. _Surrender of Shares_.

 

(a) At or immediately after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit or cause
to be deposited with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Closing Amount (calculated for the purposes of this _Section_ __ _
3.4(a)_ assuming that all outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Shares)
are tendered into the Offer), and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
timely make all payments contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_. Such cash
may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ (i)
that such investments must be in short-term obligations of the United States
of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, (ii) no such investment will relieve Parent,
Purchaser, or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_ and (iii) no such investment will have maturities that
could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any
interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. No loss incurred with
respect to such investments will decrease the amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement. In the event that the amount of cash held by the Paying Agent
is insufficient to pay the aggregate Closing Amount, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in
an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make all
such payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_. The aggregate Closing Amount
as so deposited with the Paying Agent will not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement. Any portion of the cash made available to the
Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent,
upon demand.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ "),
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
that were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form (which will (x) specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificate will pass, only upon delivery of such
Certificate to the Paying Agent and (y) contain such other provisions as are
customary and reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed
and properly completed, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered will be
cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_,
each Certificate will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and will
not evidence any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a
stockholder or other equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

 



-9- 

    

(c) No holder of record of a book-entry share (" _Book-Entry Share_ "),
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
that were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ in the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Book-Entry Shares. In lieu thereof, such
holder of record shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Book-
Entry Share, and such Book-Entry Share will be canceled. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until such
"agents message" (or such other evidence) is received, each Book-Entry Share
will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and will not evidence any interest
in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other
equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on the cash payable in respect of a Book-Entry Share.

 

(d) At any time following the date that is six (6) months after the Effective
Time, Parent may require the Paying Agent to deliver to Parent or its
designated Affiliate any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) that have been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to
the Merger Consideration payable to the holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares
for the Merger Consideration. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered, or the applicable "agents message" or other evidence is not
received in respect of a Book-Entry Share, immediately prior to the date on
which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Body, any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such time become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any individual, corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, association, trust, unincorporated organization,
other entity or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act)
previously entitled thereto.

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
will be closed, and no subsequent transfers of Shares that were issued prior
to the Effective Time will be registered. After the Effective Time, any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share presented to the Surviving Corporation for
transfer will be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this _Article III_.

(f) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the holders delivery of an affidavit of loss to the Paying Agent (and,
if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such holder of a
bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required
by Parent or the Paying Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate),
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver as consideration for the lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate, without interest and
less any applicable tax withholding.

Section 3.5. _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company Board shall take all necessary and appropriate action to approve, for
purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the related rules and
regulations thereunder, the disposition by Company directors and officers of
Shares, Company Restricted Stock and Company Stock Options in the
Contemplated Transactions.

Section 3.6. _Withholding_. The parties hereto and the Paying Agent are
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld therefrom under the United States Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or the Treasury Regulations thereunder
(the " _Treasury Regulations_ "), or any other applicable Tax Law. Any
compensatory amounts payable pursuant to or as contemplated by
this Agreement, including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, will be remitted
to the applicable payor for payment to the applicable Person through regular
payroll procedures, as applicable. To the extent that any amounts are so
deducted and withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Body, such amounts will be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

 

Section 3.7. _Transfer Taxes_. If any payment pursuant to the Offer or the
Merger is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it will be a
condition to such payment that (a) such Certificate so surrendered or Book-
Entry Share must be properly endorsed or must otherwise be in proper form
and (b) the Person presenting such Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the
Paying Agent for payment must pay to the Paying Agent any Transfer Taxes or
other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or must establish
to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent and Parent that such Tax has been paid
or is not required to be paid. Parent shall timely pay any other Transfer
Taxes incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

necessary registration, maintenance, renewal and other fees required for
maintaining the Company Registered Intellectual Property and (ii) has timely

the relevant Patent, Trademark, Copyright, domain name or other authorities in
the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the
purpose of maintaining such Company Registered Intellectual Property in full
force and effect. The Company is the exclusive owner of all rights, title and
interests in and to all Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear of all
Liens (except for Permitted Liens, non-exclusive licenses granted under the
IP Contracts or under Routine Services Contracts entered into in the ordinary
course of business, and Liens set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.13_ _(b) _ of
the Company Disclosure Letter), and possesses legally sufficient and
enforceable rights pursuant to written agreements to use all other Company
Intellectual Property as such Intellectual Property is used in the conduct of
the Companys business as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing will not be interpreted as a representation of
non-infringement of third-party Intellectual Property, which is dealt with
exclusively in _Section_ __ _ 4.13(d)_ below. No third party has any joint
ownership in any inventions claimed by any issued Patents or pending claims in
any applications for Patents included in the Company Registered Intellectual
Property.

(c) The Company uses commercially reasonable efforts to evaluate promptly
whether inventions within the Owned Intellectual Property are patentable and,
if so, the Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to file promptly
patent applications with respect thereto, except where, in the exercise of
reasonable business judgment, the Company has decided not to file or has
decided to defer filing, a patent application on a potentially patentable
invention. Except for such non-compliance that has not had a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the Company has complied with all Laws regarding the duty of
disclosure, candor and good faith in connection with each Patent included in
the Company Registered Intellectual Property. Except as has not had a Company
Material Adverse Effect, no public disclosure bar by the Company has occurred
or on sale bar by the Company has arisen which has rendered or would
reasonably be expected to render any Patent contained in the Company
Registered Intellectual Property unenforceable or unpatentable.

conduct of the Companys business has not misappropriated, infringed or
otherwise violated and is not infringing, misappropriating or otherwise
violating any Intellectual Property of any Person in any material respect.
Since the formation of the Company, the Company has not received any written
notice from any Person (i) claiming any violation, misappropriation or
infringement of the Intellectual Property of such Person or (ii) contesting
the use, ownership, validity or enforceability of any of the Company
Intellectual Property; except, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii), as
has not had a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, there is no action pending, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, against the Company claiming or contesting any of the
foregoing (other than, for clarity, office actions initiated by the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office or any foreign equivalent in the ordinary course
of prosecution). None of the material Company Intellectual Property is
subject in any material respect to any pending or outstanding judgment that
adversely restricts the use, transfer or registration of, or adversely affects
the validity or enforceability of, any such Company Intellectual Property.

 



-21- 

    

(e) Since the formation of the Company, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
Person has misappropriated, infringed or violated or is infringing,

all material obligations required to be performed by such party as of the date
of this Agreement and (ii) the Company is not in default of any such IP
Contracts in any material respect. Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _
4.13(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will
(A) result in the breach of, or create on behalf of any third party the right
to terminate or modify any IP Contract, (B) result in or require the grant,
assignment or transfer to any other Person (other than Parent, Purchaser or
any of their respective Affiliates) of any license or other right or interest
under, to or in any of the Company Intellectual Property or any of the
Intellectual Property of Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates (other than with respect to any Routine Services Contract) or (C)
cause a material loss or impairment of any Company Intellectual Property.

contractor of the Company owns (or has any claim, or any right (whether or not

Intellectual Property or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other Company
Intellectual Property. Each current and former employee, officer and director
of the Company, each current and former independent contractor and consultant
of the Company and any other third party who is or has been involved in the
creation or development of any Intellectual Property for or on behalf of the
Company has executed a valid and enforceable written agreement (i) requiring
such Person to maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information
of the Company, (ii) permitting such Person to use such information only for
the benefit of the Company in the scope of such Persons employment or

uncured breach by the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
counterparty, under any such agreement.

unauthorized disclosure or use of its material Trade Secrets (and to maintain
the secrecy and value thereof). No funding, facilities or personnel of any
Governmental Body or any university, college, research institute or other
educational institution has been or is being used in any material respect to
create, in whole or in part, any material Company Intellectual Property,
except for any such funding or use of facilities or personnel that does not
result in the grant of any license, ownership right or other right by the
Company to any Company Intellectual Property to any such

 Governmental Body or educational institution or require or otherwise
obligate the Company to grant or offer to any such Governmental Body or
educational institution any license, ownership right, or other right to any
such Company Intellectual Property (except for (i) pursuant to a Routine
Services Contract or (ii) use rights during the term of the applicable
agreement between the Company and such Governmental Body or
educational institution solely to conduct activities within the scope of such
applicable agreement or otherwise for internal research purposes pursuant to
Contracts made available to Parent and Purchaser). No current or former
employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company who contributed
to the creation or development of any Company Intellectual Property has, to
the Knowledge of the Company, performed services for a Governmental Body or
any university, college, research institute or other educational institution
related to the Companys business as presently conducted during a period of

any outstanding material judgment, injunction, rule, order or decree of any

policy, (ii) no notice of cancellation or termination has been received

applicable Person (if such Person has not been solicited in breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_) to make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board,
an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such Person agreeing that the
Company shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Parent

Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement and (C) no
earlier than the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board or any committee
thereof determines in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal that is subject
of the Determination Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and
that the failure to terminate this Agreement would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, after
consultation with outside counsel and taking into consideration the terms of
any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement that Parent has
irrevocably committed to make during the Notice Period;

(ii) the Company Board or a committee thereof may make a Change of Board
Recommendation if (A) the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a material breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, and the Company
Board or a committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (B) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to
effect a Change of Board Recommendation and (C) no earlier than the end of the

faith that the failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and that the Acquisition Proposal that is subject of the
Determination Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, after
consultation with outside counsel and taking into consideration the terms of
any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement that Parent has
irrevocably committed to make during the Notice Period; and

(iii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
or a committee thereof may make a Change of Board Recommendation in response
to an Intervening Event if (A) the Company has notified Parent in writing that
it intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation and (B) no earlier than
the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement that Parent has irrevocably committed to make during the Notice
Period, that the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(iv) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_ apply to any material
amendment to the financial terms of any applicable Superior Proposal with
respect to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)(ii)_ and
require a revised Determination Notice and a new Notice Period pursuant to
clause (i)(C) or (ii)(C) as the case may be. During the Notice Period, if
requested by Parent, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
regarding potential changes to this Agreement in such a manner that would
eliminate the need for taking the actions set forth in
_Sections 6.3(e)(i)-(ii)_ (and in respect of a Superior Proposal, would cause
such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal).

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement prohibits (i) the Company Board or a
committee thereof from (A) taking and disclosing to the holders of Shares a
position contemplated by Rule 14e 2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (B) making any public statement if the Company Board or a
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to make such statement would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii) the
Company or the Company Board from making any disclosure required under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , that any such action that would otherwise
constitute a Change of Board Recommendation shall be made only in compliance

understood that: (x) any "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication limited to the information described in Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act and (y) any disclosure of information to the holders of Shares
that only describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto and contains a statement that
the Company Board has not effected a Change of Board Recommendation shall be
deemed not to be a Change of Board Recommendation).

(g) The Company acknowledges and agrees that, for purposes of determining
whether a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ has occurred, the actions of the
Companys directors and Representatives acting in their authorized capacities
on behalf of the Company shall be deemed to be the actions of the Company,
and the Company shall be responsible for any breach of this _Section_ __ _
6.3_ by its directors and Representatives acting in their authorized

Section 6.4. _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending December 31, 2021, maintain for
each individual employed by the Company at the Effective Time (each, a "
_Current Employee_ "), to the extent they continue to be employed by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation (i) base compensation and a target annual cash
incentive compensation opportunity at least as favorable, in each case, as
that provided to the Current Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to those benefits maintained for and provided to the Current Employees under
the Company Plans that are disclosed in _Section_ __ _ 4.16(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (excluding cash incentive opportunities, severance,
equity and equity-based awards and change in control-related payments or
benefits) and in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or, to
the extent a Current Employee becomes covered by an employee benefit plan or
program of Parent (or one of its Affiliates other than the Surviving
Corporation) during such period substantially comparable to those benefits
maintained for and provided to similarly situated employees of Parent (or its
relevant Affiliate)) and (iii) severance benefits that are at least as
favorable as the severance benefits provided in a Company Plan disclosed in
_Section_ __ _ 4.16(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Each of the
Company, Parent and Purchaser acknowledges that the consummation of the
Merger will constitute a change in control of the Company under the terms of
the Company Plans disclosed in _Section_ __ _ 4.16(f)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by Current Employees to the Company prior to the Effective Time to
be taken into account with respect to employee benefit plans of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation which provide benefits for vacation, paid time-off,
severance or 401(k) savings, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits and vesting, to the same extent as such service
was taken into account under the corresponding Company Plans immediately prior
to the Effective Time for those purposes;  _provided_ _that_ the foregoing
will not apply to (i) the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service and (ii)
any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits to a
grandfathered employee population. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to not,
subject Current Employees to any eligibility requirements, waiting periods,
actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition limitations under any
employee benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any
condition for which they would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding Company Plan in which they participated prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to give such
Current Employees credit under such employee benefit plans for any eligible
expenses incurred by such Current Employees and their covered dependents under
a Company Plan during the portion of the year prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of satisfying all co-payment, co-insurance, deductibles, maximum
out-of-pocket requirements, and other out-of-pocket expenses applicable to
such Current Employees and their covered dependents in respect of the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs.

certain executives and key employees who have a critical role in research
and development and achievement of the Milestone (as defined in the CVR
Agreement) as may be selected by Parent in its sole discretion after
consultation with the Company (the " _MIP Participants_ "). As promptly as
practicable following, but in no event prior to, the Closing Date, Parent
shall select the MIP Participants and determine the amount of the MIP Pool
that will be allocated to each MIP Participant. The MIP Bonuses will be
payable on the Milestone Payment Date (as defined in the CVR Agreement), less
applicable tax withholdings, subject to (i) achievement of the Milestone on or
prior to the Expiration Date (as such terms are defined in the CVR Agreement);
(ii) the MIP Participants continuous employment through the Milestone
Payment Date; and (iii) the MIP Participants execution of an effective
general release of claims in favor of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and
related Persons in a form as provided by Parent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the MIP Pool shall be reduced in the same manner and on the
same schedule as the Milestone Payment (as defined in the CVR Agreement), and
each amount granted to MIP Participants shall be affected pro rata.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, no provision of
this Agreement (i) prohibits Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation
from amending, modifying or terminating any individual Company Plan or any
other employee benefit plan in accordance with its terms in a manner that does
not conflict with or contravene the obligations of Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_, (ii) requires Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation to keep any Person employed or otherwise providing services for
any period of time, (ii) constitutes or shall be construed to constitute the
establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any Company Plan or other
employee benefit plan or (iv) confers upon any Current Employee or any
other Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) any third-party
beneficiary or similar rights or remedies.

Section 6.5.  _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporations certificate
of incorporation and bylaws to contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation from
liabilities of present and former directors, officers, and employees of the
Company than are currently provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, which provisions may not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
such individuals until six (6) years from the Effective Time, and in the
event that any Action is pending or asserted or any claim made during such
period, until the disposition of any such Action or claim, unless such
amendment, modification, or repeal is required by applicable Law, in which
case Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, make such
changes to the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws as to have the
least adverse effect on the rights of the individuals referenced in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_.

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under
any agreement or Company Plan, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of the Effective Time) or former director or officer of the
Company (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors, administrators,
or Affiliates, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), against all obligations to pay a
judgment, settlement, or penalty and reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
arbitrative, or investigative, and whether formal or informal, arising out of
the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee,
Affiliate,

 



-44- 

    

 fiduciary, or agent of the Company, or of another entity if such service was
at the request of the Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law. In the event of any such Action, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to advance to each Indemnified Party reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the defense of the Action
(provided that any Person to whom expenses are advanced shall have provided,
to the extent required by the DGCL, an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is finally determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).
The Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with an Indemnified Party
in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek
indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to assume the defense and appoint lead counsel reasonably
acceptable to such Indemnified Party for such defense, except to the extent
otherwise provided in an indemnification agreement set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter or to the extent the Surviving Corporation or such lead
counsel fails to actively and diligently conduct the defense of such matter.
The Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action for which
indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless (i)
such settlement, compromise or consent includes (x) an unconditional release
of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action, (y)
no finding or admission of any violation of Law or the rights of any Person
and (z) no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
Indemnified Party or (ii) such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in advance
in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. The Surviving
Corporations obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall continue in
full force and effect for the period beginning upon the Effective Time and
ending six (6) years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Action asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such Action. Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.5(b)_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at or prior to
the Effective Time, following good faith consultation with Parent and, if
requested by Parent, utilizing Parents insurance broker, the Company may
purchase a tail policy under the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies maintained at such time by the Company, which tail policy
(i) will be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and
including the date six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at
the Effective Time and (ii) will contain coverage that is at least as
protective to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by such
existing policies; _provided_ , _that_ , the annual premium for such tail
policy may not be in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last
annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (the " _Maximum Amount_ ").
Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect for
their full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such
insurance policies in excess of the Maximum Amount;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the maximum amount of
coverage available for the Maximum Amount.

 

(d) Without limiting any of the rights or obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 6.5_, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
keep in full force and effect, and shall comply with the terms and conditions
of, any agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between or among
the Company and any Indemnified Party providing for the indemnification of
such Indemnified Party and Parent hereby guarantees the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to such agreements.

 



-45- 

    

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ will survive the consummation of the Merger and
is intended to benefit, and is enforceable by, any Person or entity referred
to in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_. The indemnification and advancement provided
for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5 _is not exclusive of any other rights to
which the Indemnified Party is entitled whether pursuant to Law, Contract, or
otherwise. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting from such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or a majority of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall make
proper provisions such that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.5_.

 

Section 6.6. _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the
Effective Time, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions as promptly as possible
and, in any event, by or before the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree to, or to cause their
ultimate parent entity (as such term is defined in the HSR Act) to, (i) make
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act and all other filings required pursuant to applicable foreign Antitrust
Laws with respect to the Merger as promptly as practicable and in any event
prior to the expiration of any applicable legal deadline (provided that,
unless otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent in writing, the filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act must be made on or before
December 18, 2020) and (ii) to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law. The parties also shall consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of
one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance,
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions, and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of such party in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree (A) to give each other
reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Body relating
to any Antitrust Laws, (B) to give each other an opportunity to participate
in each of such meetings, (C) to the extent practicable, to give each other
reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral communications with any
Governmental Body relating to any Antitrust Laws, (D) if any Governmental
Body initiates a substantive oral communication regarding any Antitrust Laws,
to promptly notify the other party of the substance of such communication, (E)
to provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and
comment upon all substantive written communications (including any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) with a
Governmental Body regarding any Antitrust Laws and (F) to provide each other
with copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental Body
relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any such disclosures or provision of copies by
one party to the other may be made on an outside counsel basis, if
appropriate.

  



-46- 

    

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to,
take any and all actions necessary to obtain any consents, clearances, or
approvals required under or in connection with the HSR Act, the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation, or decree
designed to prohibit, restrict, or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade or significant impediment of effective
competition (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ ") to enable all waiting periods
under applicable Antitrust Laws to expire, and to avoid or eliminate
impediments under applicable Antitrust Laws asserted by any Governmental Body,
in each case, to cause the Merger to occur as promptly as practicable and, in
any event, by or before the Outside Date, including (i) promptly complying
with any requests for additional information (including any second request) by
any Governmental Body and (ii) contesting and defending any threatened or
pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree, or ruling
or statute, rule, regulation, or executive order that would adversely affect
the ability of any party hereto to consummate the Offer and the Merger
and taking other actions to prevent the entry, enactment, or promulgation
thereof. Furthermore, Parent shall not take, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to not take, any action or omit to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to delay clearance by any Governmental Body or to make
clearance by any Governmental Body before the Outside Date less probable.
Parent shall bear the expenses and costs incurred by the parties in connection
with any filings or other such actions which may be required by such party to
obtain clearance under any Antitrust Law for the consummation of the Offer and
the Merger, in each case, after the initial filing in each jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_ or
otherwise in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any obligation offer, negotiate, commit to, or effect, by consent decree,
hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, or other
disposition of any or all of the capital stock, assets, equity holdings,
rights, products, or businesses of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation), or any other restrictions on
the activities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall take such actions
with respect to the Company (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) if such action (A) is necessary to obtain required
clearances or waiting period expirations or terminations as may be required
under the HSR Act or any Antitrust Laws by or before the Outside Date and (B)
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
materially detrimental to the benefits to be derived by Parent and its
Affiliates as a result of the Contemplated Transactions. In addition, the
Company shall not offer or commit to take any of such actions without
Parents prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not
require the Company to, and the Company shall not be required to, take any
action with respect to any consent decree, hold separate order or other
applicable Law that binds the Company prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Without limiting the obligations in clauses (a) and (b) of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_, in the event that any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental
Body challenging the Offer or the Merger, each of Parent, Purchaser, and the
Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction, decision, or other order, whether temporary, preliminary, or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

 



-47- 

    

(d) Prior to the Acceptance Time, each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any consents, approvals, or waivers of third parties with
respect to any Contracts to which it is a party as may be necessary for the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions or required by the terms of any
Contract as a result of the execution, performance, or consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ , _that_ , in no event will the Company
be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty, or other
consideration or make any other accommodation to any third party to obtain
any consent, approval, or waiver required with respect to any such Contract.

Section 6.7.  _Public Announcements_. The Company shall not, and Parent shall
not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to not, issue any press release
or announcement concerning the Contemplated Transactions without the prior
consent of the other (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), except any release or announcement required by
applicable Law or any rule or regulation of Nasdaq or any other stock exchange
to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance; it being understood that the
final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party. The
restrictions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ do not apply to communications by
the Company in connection with, or following, an Acquisition Proposal or a
Change of Board Recommendation.

Section 6.8. _Approval of Compensation Actions_. Prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall take all such
actions as may be required to approve, as an employment compensation,
severance, or other employee benefit arrangement in accordance with Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto, any and all
Compensation Actions taken after January 1, 2020 and prior to the Acceptance
Time that have not already been so approved. For the purposes of this
Agreement, " _Compensation Action_ " means any (a) granting by the Company to
any present or former director or officer of any increase in compensation or
benefits or of the right to receive any severance or termination compensation
or benefit; (b) entry by the Company into any employment, consulting,
indemnification, termination, change of control, non-competition, or
severance agreement with any present or former director or officer, or any
approval, amendment, or modification of any such agreement; or (c) approval
of, amendment to, or adoption of any Company Plan, including the MIP Pool and
any awards thereunder. 

Section 6.9. _Conduct of Parent and Purchaser_. Parent shall not, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to not, enter into any definitive agreement in
respect of an acquisition of a business, Person or assets (i) in the gene
therapy industry or (ii) in respect of the treatment of FTD-GRN, PD-GBA or
nGD, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, result in any Offer Conditions or the conditions to the Merger
not being satisfied or prevent, materially delay, or materially impede the
ability of Parent and Purchaser to consummate the Offer, the Merger, or the
other Contemplated Transactions. Parent shall, immediately following execution
of this Agreement, adopt this Agreement in its capacity as sole stockholder
of Purchaser in accordance with applicable Law and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Purchaser.

Section 6.10. _No Control of the Company_ __ _s Business_. Nothing contained
in this Agreement gives Parent or Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right

over its operations.

Company shall consult with Parent regarding the defense of any such
Stockholder Litigation, and the Company shall not settle or compromise any
Stockholder Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned, unless (i) such settlement is
fully covered by the Companys insurance policies (other than any applicable
deductible) and/or (ii) such settlement relates solely to the provision of
additional disclosure in the Schedule 14D-9, but in each case only if such
settlement would not result in the imposition of any restriction on the
business or operations of the Company or its Affiliates. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly of the commencement or written threat of any
proceedings of which it has received notice or become aware and shall keep
Parent promptly and reasonably informed regarding any such proceedings.

 

Section 6.13. _Regulatory Matters_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Parent
and its Representatives, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Parent,
complete and accurate copies of (a) all material clinical and preclinical
data relating to each Product and (b) all material written correspondence
between the Company and the applicable Governmental Bodies relating to any

due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ when due and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Purchaser commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the amount set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_, the
