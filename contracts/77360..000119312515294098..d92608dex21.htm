not limit the obligation of the Surviving Corporation to maintain any Employee Plan that, pursuant to an existing Contract, must be maintained for a period longer than two years. No provision of this Agreement will be construed as a guarantee of
continued employment of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and this Agreement will not be construed so as to prohibit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment of any
employee of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) For a period of two years following the Closing Date, any employee

an Employee Plan to the same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under such Employee Plan. With respect to the calendar year in which Parent or Buyer ceases to maintain any particular Employee
Plan, each employee will be given credit for amounts paid under such Employee Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
