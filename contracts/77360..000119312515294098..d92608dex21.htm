Corporation Law (" _OGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge
(the " _Merger_ ") with and into the Company, with the Company being the

Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the closing of the Transactions

which is the later of (a) October 15,

 



1  2015 or (b) satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_, or
such other time and place as Buyer (without joinder by Merger Sub) and the
Company may mutually agree (the " _Closing Date_ ").

1.3 _Filing of Certificate of Merger; Effective Time_. As soon as practicable
on the Closing Date, Merger Sub and the Company will cause the certificate of
merger for the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the OGCL. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Effective Time_ " means the time at which the Certificate of Merger has been
duly filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio, or at
such later date or time as may be agreed by Buyer and the Company in writing
and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the OGCL.

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the
OGCL and, without limiting the foregoing, all properties, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Merger Sub and the Company will vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Merger Sub and
the Company will become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.5 _Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations_. The articles of
incorporation and code of regulations of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the articles of incorporation and code of
regulations of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt,
the provisions of the Companys articles of incorporation (" _Articles_ ")
and code of regulations (" _Regulations_ ") and the indemnity Contracts to
which the Company are parties as of immediately prior to the Closing will
govern the rights of all directors and officers of the Company in respect of
claims for indemnification based in whole or in part on actions or failures to
take action prior to the Closing, and neither the amendments thereto
contemplated hereby or following the Closing will affect the rights and
obligations thereunder relating to such actions or failures to take action.

1.6  _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office until his or her respective successor is duly elected or
appointed and qualified, or his or her earlier death, resignation or removal,
in accordance with the Surviving Corporations articles of incorporation and
code of regulations and the applicable provisions of the OGCL.

1.7 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation considers or is advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in or to be
vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection

 



2  with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation will execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things
as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets
in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

1.8 _Merger Consideration and Conversion of Capital Stock_. The aggregate
amount payable by Buyer in the Merger will be the amount in cash equal to the
Aggregate Merger Consideration. The portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time
pursuant to _Sections 1.8(a)-(b)_ will be an amount (the " _Closing Merger
Consideration_ ") equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration, _minus_ the
Funded Debt of the Company, _plus_ the Cash and Cash Equivalents of the
Company _minus_ the amount of the Company Transaction Expenses and  _plus_
33% of the amount of the Company Transaction Expenses set forth on _Schedule
1.8_. Subject to this _Article I_ and in accordance with _Article II_ , at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Shareholder:

(a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share (a " _Company Common Share_ ") of
Company Common Stock that is then issued and outstanding (other than the
Dissenting Shares and Cancelled Shares, if any) will be converted and
automatically exchanged into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration as set forth on the
Closing Payments Schedule pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_. At the Effective
Time, all Company Common Shares will be automatically cancelled and will cease
to exist, and subject to _Section 1.9_, the holders of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Shares
will cease to have any rights with respect to Company Common Shares other than
the right to receive the Closing Merger Consideration.

 

(b) _Company Owned Shares_. Each Company Common Share that is held by the
Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_
") will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be
delivered in exchange for such cancellation.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is then
issued and outstanding will be converted into one newly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

1.9 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary and to the extent required by the OGCL, any Company Common Shares
that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that
are held by any Shareholder who (a) was a record holder of Company Common
Shares as to which such Shareholder seeks relief as of the date fixed for
determination of Shareholders

 



3  entitled to notice of a meeting of the Shareholders held to approve the
Merger, (b) has not directly or indirectly caused the applicable Company
Common Shares to have been voted in favor of the Merger, and (c) delivers to
the Company, in accordance with the OGCL (including section 1701.85 of the
OGCL) and before the vote on the Merger is taken, a written demand for payment
of the fair cash value of such Company Common Shares (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ", and together with the Cancelled Shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")
will not be converted into the right to receive the Closing Merger
Consideration, unless and until such holder of Dissenting Shares fails to
perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses any such rights as a
dissenting Shareholder under the OGCL. If a holder of Dissenting Shares fails
to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses any such rights as a
dissenting Shareholder under the OGCL, then as of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such holders Company Common
Shares will automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration, without
interest, and will no longer be Excluded Shares. The Company will give Buyer
prompt notice of, and copies of all correspondence from, each Shareholder who
asserts rights as a dissenting Shareholder following receipt of such
Shareholders written demand delivered as provided in section 1701.85 of the
OGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may not, except with the prior
written consent of Buyer, voluntarily make any payment or commit or agree to
make any payment, or settle or commit to offer to settle, any rights of a
dissenting Shareholder.

1.10  _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the Effective
Date and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding capital shares of
the Company, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
capital shares of the Company, will occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any
stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period,
the Per Share Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change, except that nothing in this Agreement will be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
or not expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

II. PAYMENT OF CONSIDERATION

 

2.1 _Estimated Closing Statement_. Not fewer than five Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Buyer a written

after repayment of any loans for which such Persons Company Common Shares
are pledged as collateral (the " _Net Amount_ "), which will be updated after
the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date to reflect any change in the amount of the Funded Debt, the Cash and
Cash Equivalents and/or Company Transaction Expenses as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date from the
amounts set forth in the Funded Debt Payment Schedule, Cash and
Cash Equivalents Schedule and/or the Transaction Expense Payment Schedule.

(e) The Parties agree that Buyer and Merger Sub will be entitled to (i)
review and make reasonable objections to the matters and amounts set forth in
the Closing Statement and the update thereto contemplated by _Section 2.1(d)_
and (ii) rely on the Closing Statement, as so updated, in making payments
under _Article II_ , and Buyer and Merger Sub will not be responsible for the
calculations or the determinations of the Company regarding such calculations
in the Closing Statement, including any update. The Company will cooperate,
and will cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate, with Buyer and Merger Sub in
the review of the Closing Statement, including any update, and, if applicable,
the Companys response to a Closing Statement objection, including providing
Buyer and Merger Sub and its representatives with reasonable access during
normal business hours to the relevant books, records and finance employees of

(b) each Person listed on the Funded Debt Payment Schedule, the amount set

transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the instructions
set forth in the Funded Debt Payment Schedule; and

(c) each Company Professional Advisor listed on the Transaction Expense

all such amounts and the written confirmation set forth in _Section 5.12_ no
later than two Business Days prior to the Closing, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with the instructions set forth in
the Transaction Expense Payment Schedule.

2.3 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates; Letters of Transmittal_.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event will any Person who
is entitled to receive any payment pursuant to this Agreement as a result of
any Company Common Shares receive any such payment unless and until such time
as the applicable Person delivers to Buyer or the Company (a) a letter of
transmittal in the applicable form set forth in _Schedule 2.3_ , pursuant to
which such Person will, among other things, (i) agree that if such Persons
Company Common Shares are pledged as collateral for a loan, then a portion of
the amount to be paid at the Effective Time to such Person pursuant to
_Section 1.8(a)_ that is equal to the remaining balance of such loan will be
paid to the lender for such loan such that all Liens related to such loan on
such Company Common Shares are released upon such payment and (ii) represent
that upon payment of the Net Amount to such Person, such Persons Company
Common Shares will be free and clear of all Liens (each, an " _LT_ ") and, if
applicable, a properly executed substitute Form W-9 or similar document and
(b) certificates (" _Certificates_ ") representing such Company Common Shares,
which Certificates so surrendered will be cancelled and the holder of such
Certificate will receive in exchange therefor the right to receive the
applicable consideration set forth in _Section 1.8(a)_. In the event any
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person that includes an agreement to indemnify
Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub against all liability costs, damages and
expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, which may be incurred by Parent,
Buyer and/or Merger Sub in connection therewith, claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, Buyer will, subject to this _Article II_ , issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable
consideration therefor set forth in _Section 1.8(a)_. Payment by Buyer of
the amounts contemplated by _Section 2.2(a)_ to the Closing Account will
constitute full satisfaction of Buyers obligations under _Section 2.2(a)_.

 

2.4 _Withholding_. The Surviving Corporation and Buyer will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Shares such amounts as are required
to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or 

 



6  any provision of U.S. state or local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the
making of such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will provide
Buyer with the information reasonably requested by Buyer to make a
determination of which Shareholders, if any, are subject to withholding within
five Business Days after the Effective Date; _provided_ _further_ that, Buyer
will provide to the Company prior written notice at least five Business Days
prior to the Closing of its determination that any Shareholder or Shareholders
will be subject to withholding and will discuss such determination with the
Company in good faith. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted
and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such withheld or
deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares in respect of which
or whom such deduction and withholding were made.

21  Transactions. Parent has delivered to the Company, as of the date hereof,
true, complete and accurate copies of an executed commitment letter and an
executed arranger fee letter (redacted in a manner reasonably acceptable to
the arrangers party thereto), each dated the date hereof, among Parent, an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent party thereto (" _Finance Sub_ ")
and the financial institutions party thereto, providing for the debt
financing described therein (being collectively referred to as the "
_Financing_ ") (the " _Financing Commitments_ "), it being understood that
Parent hereby informs the Company of the confidential nature of the Financing
Commitments. The Financing Commitments are in full force and effect as of the
date hereof, and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, Finance
Sub, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto. As
of the date hereof, (a) no amendment or modification of the Financing
Commitments has been made or is contemplated and (b) the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect. Parent or Finance Sub has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Financing
Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set
forth in or expressly contemplated by the Financing Commitments. As of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent or Finance Sub or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereto, under the Financing Commitments, provided
that Parent is not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect
of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in Article III or
breach by the Company of any of its covenants hereunder. As of the date of
this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will
not be available to Parent or Finance Sub as of the Effective Time, provided
that Parent is not making any representation regarding the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III, or compliance by the
Company with its covenants hereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no side letters or other Contracts to which Parent or any of its
Affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Financing other than (1) as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitments, (2) any customary engagement letter(s) and/or non-
disclosure agreements(s), and (3) any letter or other Contract that does not
impact the conditionality, availability or aggregate amount of the Financing.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parents and Buyers obligations under this
Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding Parents, Buyers, their
Affiliates or any other Persons ability to obtain financing, including the
Financing, for the consummation of the Transactions.

4.7 _Information Statement; Other Information_. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub in writing for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information Statement will at
the time of the Company Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, at the time and in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



22 4.8 _Brokers  Fees_. No broker, finder, investment banker or other Person is
entitled to any brokerage fee, finders fee or other commission in connection
with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by Parent, Buyer or any of
their Affiliates, except for Goldman, Sachs and Co.

 

4.9 _Solvency; Surviving Corporation After the Merger_. None of Parent, Buyer
or Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement or the Transactions with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors. After
giving effect to the Merger, at and immediately after the Effective Time, each
of Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation (assuming the solvency of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time) and their respective
Subsidiaries will be solvent and will have adequate capital and liquidity with
which to engage in its business.

 

4.10 _No Outside Reliance_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
_Article IV_ or any other provision hereof, each of Parent, Buyer and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates,
agents or representatives is making any representation or warranty whatsoever,
express or implied (including any implied warranty or representation as
to condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular
purpose or trade as to any of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), beyond those expressly given in _Article III_. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any cost estimates,
financial or other projections or other predictions regarding the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, as well as any information, documents or other
materials made available to Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates or
advisors are not and will not be deemed to be representations or warranties of
the Company, and each of Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge that Parent
and Buyer, together with their Affiliates and advisors, have made their own
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and are not relying on any
implied warranties or upon any representation or warranty whatsoever as to the
prospects (financial or otherwise) or the viability or likelihood of success
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as conducted after the
Closing, as contained in any materials provided or made available by the
Company or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, shareholders, partners, members or representatives or
otherwise. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, each of
Parent and Buyer understands and agrees that any inventory, equipment,
vehicles, assets, properties and business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
are furnished "as is," "where is" and subject to the representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ , with all faults and without any other
representation or warranty of any nature whatsoever.

 

4.11 _Acquisition for Investment_. Each of Parent and Buyer has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters such that it is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its participation in the Merger. Buyer is
acquiring the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for investment and
not with a view toward or for sale in connection with any distribution
thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation. Buyer understands and agrees that capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation may not be sold, transferred, offered for
sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration

 



23  under the 1933 Act, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration
available under such Act, and without compliance with state, local and foreign
securities Laws, in each case, to the extent applicable.

Subsidiary existing on the Closing Date;

 

(xi) (A) make any material loans, advances or capital contributions to any

and other representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, in
such manner as to

 



25  not interfere with normal operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to
all of their respective properties, books, Contracts, personnel records and
other information concerning its Subsidiaries, properties and personnel as
Buyer may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries nor any of their Affiliates is under any obligation
to disclose to Buyer any information the disclosure of which (i) is
restricted by applicable Law or any obligations to any third party or (ii) is
subject to attorney-client privilege. Buyer and its representatives will not
have access to employment records of individual employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing except on such terms as may be agreed by
the Company and Buyer in order to protect confidential information and ensure
compliance with all applicable Laws and the Companys policies.
Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ will be conducted in such
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of
the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, give any Person (together with their Affiliates and any
of their respective trusts or other estate planning vehicles) owning, prior
to the Closing, at least 10% of the outstanding Company Common Shares
reasonable access during the Surviving Corporations regular business hours
upon reasonable advance notice and under reasonable circumstances to books,
records and personnel of the Surviving Corporation for personal tax and legal
compliance purposes or as otherwise may be necessary to exercise any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, including in connection with any
Actions under Article VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Buyer nor
the Surviving Corporation is under any obligation to disclose to any such
Person (or their Affiliates or any of their respective trusts or other estate
planning vehicles) any information the disclosure of which (i) is restricted
by applicable Law or any obligations to any third party or (ii) is subject to
attorney-client privilege.

 

5.3 _Reasonable Efforts_. Without limiting any other covenant contained in
this _Article V_, Buyer and the Company will, and will each cause their
respective Subsidiaries to (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to
assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement such
information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly
as practicable all Authorizations of any Governmental Authority required to
be obtained in connection with the Transactions, (b) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all material Authorizations of third parties that
any of Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates are required to
obtain in order to consummate the Transactions, and (c) take such other action
as may reasonably be necessary or as another Party may reasonably request to
satisfy the conditions of  _Article VI_ or otherwise to comply with this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any material expense or pay any material
fee or grant any material concession in connection with obtaining any
Authorizations required in order to consummate the Merger pursuant to the
terms of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party. 

5.4 _Antitrust Approvals_. (a) Each of Parent, Buyer and the Company will (i)
make or cause to be made all filings required of it or its Affiliates under
the Antitrust

 



26  Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and, in any
event, within five Business Days from the Effective Date, (ii) comply at the
earliest practicable date with any request under the Antitrust Laws for
additional information, documents or other materials received by it or its
Affiliates from any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or the
Transactions, and (iii) cooperate with the other in connection with any such
filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of
any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law with respect to any such
filing or the Transactions. Each of Parent, Buyer and the Company will use
its best efforts to furnish to the other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the Transactions and promptly inform the other of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or the Transactions. No
Party will independently participate in any scheduled meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filing,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party prior notice of
the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent will have
the right to direct all discussions, matters, proceedings and negotiations
with any Governmental Authority or other Person regarding any of the
Transactions, provided that it will keep the Company informed and will afford
the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein.

(b) Without limiting the generality or effect of _Sections 5.2_ or _5.3_ or
any other provision hereof, each of Parent, Buyer and the Company will take
any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority to the
extent required to permit the Parties to close the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practical, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of any of its assets, properties or businesses or
of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this
Agreement as are required to be divested or such other actions as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the Transactions. In addition, each of Parent, Buyer and
Merger Sub will use its respective best efforts to defend through litigation
on the merits any claim asserted in court by any Person in order to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Governmental Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the consummation of
the Closing.

(c) Subject to the provisions of  _Section 5.4_, Parent will have the right,
exercised in good faith, to determine the scope of undertakings required to be
taken in order to meet the obligations of _Sections 5.3_ and _5.4_ , provided
that nothing in this sentence limits the covenants in _Section 5.4(b)_ of
this Agreement. With regard to the obligations under _Section 5.4_, but
subject to _Section 5.4(b)_, Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub will have the right
to take (or decline to take) any and all steps or actions they choose in
order to avoid or to minimize the extent or effect of any divestiture,
restriction, condition or other relief that may be sought in relation to the
Transactions, and the 

 



27  Company will, and will cause its Affiliates, to reasonably cooperate with
and reasonably assist Parent with regard to the foregoing, including defending
through litigation on the merits any claim arising under Antitrust Laws.
Further, nothing in this Agreement will require, or be construed to require,
that Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub become subject to, or consent or agree to any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Governmental Order
relating to Antitrust Laws the consummation or effectiveness of which is not
conditioned upon the Closing or that would be binding on Parent, Buyer or
Merger Sub in the event that the Closing does not occur. With regard to
any Governmental Authority or any Action relating to Antitrust Laws regarding
any of the Transactions, neither Company or any of its Affiliates, without
Parents advance written consent, will propose to any Governmental Authority
or commit to any divestiture or consent decree, discuss or commit to alter
their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or otherwise take or
commit to take any action that would limit Parents or Buyers freedom of
action with respect to any aspect of the Company after Closing, Parents or
Buyers ability to retain any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interest therein that are part of the Company, or
Parents or Buyers ability to receive the full benefits of the Transactions.

(d) Buyer will be solely responsible for and pay all filing fees payable to
Governmental Authorities under any Antitrust Law.

5.5 _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) In the event of any threatened or
actual Action, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such
Action in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
Effective Date, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or who
is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person,
is, or is threatened to be, made a party or witness based in whole or in part
on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining in whole or in part
to (i) the fact that such Person is serving or did serve in any such capacity
or (ii) acts or omissions by such Person in the Persons capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or taken at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including
in connection with serving at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries
as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another
Person), in each case under (i) and (ii), at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions), Parent, the Surviving Corporation and Buyer will, jointly and
severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
permitted or required by applicable Law, and in addition to and separately
from indemnification anticipated to be provided by the organizational
documents of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or its Subsidiaries, and
any indemnity agreements applicable to any such indemnitee, against any Losses
(including reimbursement for legal and other fees and expenses incurred in
advance of the final disposition of any such matter or investigation to each
indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law).

 

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent and Buyer will
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors and
officers liability

 



28  insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Companys
or any of its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance
policies on terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such
current insurance coverage, except that if any claim is asserted or made
within such six-year period, such insurance will be continued in respect of
such claim until the final disposition thereof; provided, however that in no
event will the Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 250% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date
of this Agreement, which last annual premium amount is set forth in _Schedule
5.5(b)_ , but in such case will purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ will survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified Person hereunder and its successors and representatives. The
rights of the indemnified Persons under this _Section 5.5_ will be in
addition to any rights such Persons may have under the organizational
or indemnification documents of Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, by contract or by Law.

(d) The obligations under this  _Section 5.5_ will not be terminated or
modified by Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation in a manner as to
adversely affect any indemnified Person to whom this _Section 5.5_ applies
without the consent of the affected indemnified Person. In the event that any
of Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Persons
or (ii) transfers 50% or more of its properties or assets to any Person, then
and in each case, proper provision will be made so that the applicable
successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.5_.

 

5.6 _Employment Matters_. (a) For a period of no less than two years following
the Closing Date, Buyer will cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to
provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date with salary, wages, cash bonus opportunities, and commission rates, if
applicable, and benefits which in the aggregate are at least substantially
comparable to those salary, wages, cash bonus opportunities, and commission
rates, if applicable, and benefits provided prior to the Closing Date by the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. This _Section 5.6_ will not
limit the obligation of the Surviving Corporation to maintain any Employee
Plan that, pursuant to an existing Contract, must be maintained for a period
longer than two years. No provision of this Agreement will be construed as a
guarantee of continued employment of any employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and this Agreement will not be construed so as to prohibit
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from having the right to
terminate the employment of any employee of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries.

(b) For a period of two years following the Closing Date, any employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date whose employment is
terminated after Closing will be entitled to severance in accordance with the
past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, which
practices are described on _Schedule 5.6(b)_.

(c) Each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date
will be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date
under any employee benefit plan of Parent, Buyer and its Subsidiaries
providing benefits similar to those provided under an Employee Plan to the
same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit
for such service under such Employee Plan. With respect to the calendar year
in which Parent or Buyer ceases to maintain any particular Employee Plan,
each employee will be given credit for amounts paid under such Employee Plan
for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums
as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the parallel plan, program or arrangement of Parent, Buyer or
its Subsidiaries.

 



29 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release announcing this
Agreement will be in substantially the form previously agreed to by
representatives of the Parties. Thereafter, no Party will issue any press
release or otherwise make any similar public announcement with respect to the
Transactions, without giving the other Party the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any such release or announcement, but only to the extent
any such disclosure is materially inconsistent with any disclosure previously
made available to the other Party, except that any Party may make any public
disclosure it believes in good faith is required by Law, legal process or the
rules and regulations of any national securities exchange, in which case it
will, if reasonably practicable in the circumstances, use its reasonable
efforts to consult with the other Party with respect to the timing and
content thereof.

5.8 _No Solicitation; Exclusivity_. From the Effective Date until the Closing
Date, the Company will not, and will direct its Affiliates, directors,
officers, agents and other representatives acting on its behalf or at the
direction of the Company not to, directly or indirectly through another
Person, initiate, authorize or knowingly permit any contact with, solicit,
knowingly encourage or enter into or continue any negotiations, understandings
or agreements with any third party with respect to or in connection with, or
furnish or disclose any non-public information regarding the Company or its
Subsidiaries to any third party in connection with, any merger, consolidation,
share exchange, recapitalization, other business combination or asset sale
transaction or any other similar transaction that is inconsistent with the
Transactions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case
other than the Transactions (each, a "Competing Transaction"). The Company
will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be
terminated, and will not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their
representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Competing Transaction. If the Company, any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries receives any inquiry from any Person or entity
other than Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub relating to any Competing Transaction
or any of the actions prohibited by this _Section 5.8_, then the Company
will promptly provide Parent or Buyer with written notice, including the
identity of the Person or entity seeking such discussions or negotiations,
making such inquiry or proposal or requesting such information and a summary
in reasonable detail of the material terms, conditions and other content of
such discussions, negotiations, inquiries, proposals and requests.

 



30 5.9 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Company may, at its option, include in the
Disclosure Schedule items that are not material in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts,
will not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that such items
are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define further
the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement. Information
disclosed in any Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company will qualify any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement to the
extent that the relevance or applicability of the information disclosed to the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is reasonably apparent on its
face, notwithstanding the absence of a reference or cross-reference to
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on any such Disclosure
Schedule or the absence of a reference or cross-reference to such Disclosure
Schedule in such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Descriptions
of terms or documents summarized in the Disclosure Schedule will be qualified
in their entirety by the documents themselves.

5.10 _Company Shareholder Approval_. (a) As promptly as practicable following
the Effective Date, the Company will prepare the Information Statement. Buyer
and the Company will cooperate with each other in connection with the
preparation of the Information Statement, which cooperation will include
Buyers right to review and provide comments on the Information Statement and
to have its reasonable comments included therein. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Information Statement to be delivered to
the Shareholders as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than 10
days after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing
by or on behalf of Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Information Statement. If at any time prior to the Company
Meeting, any information should be discovered by any Party which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Information Statement so that the
Information Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information
will promptly notify the other Parties and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information will be promptly disseminated by the Company to the Shareholders.

(b) The Company will take all action necessary in accordance with the OGCL
and its Articles and Regulations to duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its Shareholders as promptly as practicable, but in any
event no later than 30 days after the Effective Date, for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (such meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Meeting_ "). Once the Company Meeting has
been called and noticed, the Company will not postpone or adjourn the Company
Meeting without the consent of Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub (other than (a) in
order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders or (b) as reasonably determined
by the Company to comply with applicable Law).

 



31 5.11 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Company and Buyer and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated in this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.12 _Company Transaction Expenses_. In connection with the Closing, the
Company will provide to Buyer written confirmation from each Company
Professional Advisor that the Company has paid all fees and expenses of such
Company Professional Advisor (but not indemnity obligations) outstanding
through the Closing.

 

5.13 _Financing Matters_. (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries to, at the sole expense of Buyer, use its and their
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in good faith to provide such
information to Buyer as it reasonably requests in connection with the
arrangement of any Financing and with respect to any existing financing
of Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with the Transactions (provided
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing sentence, prior to the Closing, the Company will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries to, at the sole expense of Buyer, use its and
their commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) as promptly as reasonably
practicable provide information (financial or otherwise) relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Financing Sources (including information
to be used in the preparation of an information package regarding the
business, operations and financial projections of Parent and the
Company customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of any
Financing) to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer to prepare customary
offering or information documents to be used for the completion of any
Financing, and otherwise provide customary information, documents,
authorization letters and certificates, enter into agreements and take other
actions that are or may be customary in connection with any Financing and are
reasonably requested by Buyer (including all documentation and
other information required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable
"know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations); (ii)
reasonably cooperate with the marketing efforts of Buyer, its Affiliates and
the Financing Sources, including participating in a reasonable number of
meetings, due diligence sessions and road shows, at times and at locations
reasonably acceptable to the Company, (iii) reasonably assist in preparing
customary offering memoranda, rating agency presentations, lender
presentations, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and other similar
documents, (iv) make available, on a customary and reasonable basis and upon
reasonable notice, appropriate personnel, documents and information relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case, as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer

 



32  or as may be requested by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") in connection with the completion of any Financing, (v) obtain
customary financing accountants comfort letters and consents of accountants
for use of their reports in any materials relating to any Financing and in
connection with any filings required to be made by Buyer and/or its Affiliates
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _1933 Act_ ") or the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the " _1934 Act_ ") (including any registration
statement), (vi) subject to customary confidentiality provisions, provide
customary authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors, and (vii)
obtain customary pay-off letters and provide notices of prepayment with
respect to Funded Debt that will be repaid pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ and
obtain instruments of release, termination and discharge of all Liens on
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries related to such Funded Debt
effective as of the Closing (all of which will be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, and the Company will permit Parent and its
representatives to review and comment on any such documentation reasonably in
advance of the execution and delivery thereof). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur prior to the
Closing any other liability or obligation in connection with any Financing or
any of the actions contemplated by this _Section 5.13_ and (B) none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors or employees
will be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with
respect to any Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing occurring or
that would be effective prior to the Closing (other than authorization letters
contemplated by _clause (vi)_ of this _Section 5.13_). Buyer will, promptly
upon request by the Company accompanied by a reasonably detailed invoice,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in satisfying its obligations under this _Section
5.13 _and Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub will, jointly and severally, indemnify
the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates and representatives from and
against any Losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
this _Section 5.13_. Pending receipt of such reimbursement, all such
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs will be deemed "Cash and Cash
Equivalents" for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that Parents and Buyers obligations under
this Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding Parents, Buyers,
their Affiliates or any other Persons ability to obtain financing for the
consummation of the Transactions and, accordingly, each of Parent, Buyer and
Merger Sub agree that a breach or alleged breach of _Section 5.13(a)_ by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries will not constitute a breach or failure to
comply with the covenants of this Agreement for purposes of  _Section
6.2(b)_ and each of Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub covenant to refrain from
claiming that the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ has not been
satisfied as a result of a breach or alleged breach of  _Section 5.13(a)_ by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

5.14 _Notices of Certain Events_. The Company will notify Parent, Buyer and
Merger Sub, and Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub will notify the Company, promptly
of (a)

 



33  any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) any notice or other communication from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, (c) any
Actions commenced, or to such partys Knowledge, threatened, against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, that are related to the Transactions, and (d) any event, change or
effect between the Effective Date and the Effective Time which causes or is
reasonably likely to cause the failure of the conditions set forth in Article
VI of this Agreement, to be satisfied. In no event will (i) the delivery of
any notice by a party pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ limit or otherwise
affect the respective rights, obligations, representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties, (ii) disclosure by the Company, Parent or Buyer be
deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules or constitute an
exception to any representation or warranty, or (iii) the failure of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide notice pursuant to this _Section
5.14_ with respect to a breach or alleged breach of any representation or
warranty constitute a breach or failure to comply with the covenants of this
Agreement for purposes of _Section 6.2(b)_ and each of Parent, Buyer or
Merger Sub covenant to refrain from claiming that the condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(b)_ has not been satisfied as a result of such a breach or
alleged breach of this _Section 5.14_ by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

5.15 _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company will deliver to Buyer a certificate,
dated as of the Closing Date and executed under penalties of perjury, stating
that the Company is not, and has not been at any time within the five years
preceding the Closing Date, a United States real property holding corporation
(within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code), which certificate will
comply with the requirements of Treas. Reg. § 1.897-2(h).

the other representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (but
without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers) shall
be true and correct in all respects, in each case as of the Effective Date and
as of the Closing Date, as if made anew at and as of that time, except
with respect to representations and warranties which speak as to another
date, which representations and warranties will be so true and correct at and
as of such date, except that in the event of a breach of a representation or
warranty (except for with respect to _Sections 3.3_ and/or _3.6_ ) the
condition set forth in this _Section 6.2(a)_ will be deemed satisfied unless
the effect of all such breaches taken together would reasonably be expected to

(e) since the Effective Date, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company shall
not have occurred that is continuing as of the Closing Date.

Company to consummate the Transactions are subject to the satisfaction of the
following additional conditions, any one or more of which may be waived in
writing by the Company:

at and as of such date, except that in the event of a breach of a
representation or warranty the condition set forth in this _Section 6.3(a)_

on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, may rely on the failure
of any condition set forth in _Section 6.1_, _Section 6.2_ or _Section
6.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied to excuse it from its obligation to
effect the Merger if such failure was caused by such Partys failure to
comply with its obligations to consummate the Merger or the other Transactions
to the extent required by this Agreement.

 

VII. TERMINATION/EFFECTIVENESS

 

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time as follows (each of which
constitutes an independent right of termination):

(a) by mutual consent of Buyer (without joinder of Parent or Merger Sub) and
the Company (notwithstanding, the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval); or

(b) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Buyer (without joinder of
Parent or Merger Sub), on the other hand, if the Closing has not occurred on
or before December 31, 2015 (the " _Termination Date_ "), except that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 7.1(b)_ will
not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
results in or causes the failure of the Transactions to be completed by such
time; or

 

(c) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Buyer (without joinder of
Parent or Merger Sub), on the other hand, if the consummation of
the Transactions (or any portion thereof) is enjoined, prohibited or
otherwise restrained by the terms of a final, non-appealable Governmental
Order of a court of competent jurisdiction, except that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 7.1(c)_ will not be available to
any Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in or causes
such Governmental Order or the failure of such Governmental Order to be
removed; or

 

(d) by Buyer (without joinder of Parent or Merger Sub), on the one hand, or
the Company, on the other hand, if there is any material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company, on
the

 



36  one hand, or Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub, on the other hand, set forth in
this Agreement, such that the conditions specified in _Section 6.2(a)_ or
_6.2(b)_ (in the case of a termination by Buyer) or _Section 6.3(a)_ or
_6.3(b)_ (in the case of a termination by the Company) would not be satisfied
at the Closing and, in either such case, such breach cannot be cured by the
Termination Date, or if capable of being cured, is not cured within 30 days
after written notice of such breach is given by the applicable Party (or, if
earlier, the Termination Date), except that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ will not be available to any
Party who is then in material breach of any of its obligations under this
Agreement.

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_, this Agreement will forthwith
become void and have no effect, and no Party, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of the officers or directors of any of the
foregoing, will have any liability of any nature whatsoever under this
Agreement, or in connection with the Transactions, except that (i) the
Confidentiality Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement,
(ii) Buyer may have liability as provided in _Section 7.3_, (iii) the Company
may have liability as provided in _Section 7.4_, and (iii) notwithstanding
any termination or any contrary provision contained in this Agreement other
than a termination in connection with which Buyer pays the Buyer Termination
Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3_ or the Company pays the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to  _Section 7.4_, no Party will be relieved or released from
liability for damages of any kind, including consequential damages and any
other damages (whether or not communicated or contemplated at the time of
execution of this Agreement) and including as damages the value lost by the
Shareholders entitled to receive payments hereunder based on the consideration
that would otherwise have been paid and the benefits that would have accrued,
arising out of any (A) knowing material breach of any of its representations
and warranties in this Agreement or (B) deliberate material breach of any
covenant of this Agreement (other than _Section 5.13_, which cannot in any
event serve as the basis of a breach of covenant claim pursuant to this
_Section 7.2(a)_), except that if the Closing has not occurred, (1) in no
event will any officer or director of the Company or any Shareholder have any
liability under this Agreement to Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, (2) in no event will any officer or director of Parent,
Buyer or Merger Sub have any liability under this Agreement to the Company,
any of its Affiliates or any Shareholders, (3) the Companys recovery of
damages against Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub if established as provided in
this _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ may not exceed $126,000,000 in the aggregate, and
(4) notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.2_ to the contrary, Parent,
Buyer and Merger Sub will have no right to commence directly or indirectly any
Action against the Company, any of its Affiliates or any officer, director,
employee, representative or advisor of the Company or any Shareholder
for damages under (A) or (B) above and Parents, Buyers and Merger Subs
sole remedy will be receipt of the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section 7.4_.

 

(b) For purposes of this _Section 7.2_, (i) a "knowing" breach of a
representation and warranty will be deemed to have occurred only if an
executive officer of the Party alleged to have breached had actual knowledge
of such breach as of the Effective Date (without any independent duty of
investigation or verification other than an actual 

 



37  reading of the representations and warranties as they appear in this
Agreement by such Partys chief executive officer, chief operating officer and
chief financial officer) and (ii) a "deliberate" breach of any covenant will
be deemed to have occurred only if an executive officer of the Party alleged
to have breached took or failed to take action with actual knowledge that
there was a substantial likelihood that the action so taken or omitted to be
taken constituted a breach of such covenant. For purposes of this Section
7.2(b), an "executive officer" will have the meaning given to the term
"officer" in Rule 16a-1(f) under the 1934 Act. 

7.3 _Buyer Termination Fee_. (a) In the event that the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_, then in such
case, if at such time all conditions to Parents, Buyers and Merger Subs
obligations to consummate the Merger and the Transactions will have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are expected to
be satisfied as of the Closing or by actions taken at the Closing or other
conditions that are not satisfied as a result of the events which gave rise to
the right to terminate pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_),
then at the Companys option, Buyer will pay to the Company a termination fee
of $54,000,000 in cash in immediately available funds (the " _Buyer
Termination Fee_ "). In the event that the Company or Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ and at such time all conditions to
Parents, Buyers and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger and
the Transactions will have been satisfied and all conditions to the Companys
obligation to consummate the Merger and the Transactions will have been
satisfied (in each case other than those conditions that by their nature are
expected to be satisfied as of the Closing or by actions taken at the
Closing) except the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_, then Buyer will
pay to the Company the Buyer Termination Fee in cash in immediately available
funds. In the event that the Company receives full payment pursuant to this
_Section 7.3_, the receipt of the Buyer Termination Fee will be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all Losses suffered or incurred by the Company
in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions (and the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
neither the Company nor any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain
any Action against Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the
Transactions (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination. The Parties understand that in no
event will Buyer be required to pay the Buyer Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. For the avoidance of doubt, unless the Company exercises its
option to receive the Buyer Termination Fee as provided in the first sentence
above and receives such Buyer Termination Fee or the Company receives the
Buyer Termination Fee as provided in the second sentence above, nothing in
this Agreement limits the Companys right to sue Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub
for damages in accordance with and subject to  _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ or seek
specific performance or other equitable relief.

(b) Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Buyer fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this
_Section 7.3_, and, in order to obtain the payment, the Company commences an
Action which results in a judgment against Parent, Buyer

 



38  or Merger Sub, Buyer will pay the Company its reasonable and documented
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime
rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received.

 

7.4 _Company Termination Fee_. (a) In the event that Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, then in such case, if at such time
all conditions to the Companys obligations to consummate the Merger and the
Transactions will have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their nature are expected to be satisfied as of the Closing or by actions
taken at the Closing or other conditions that are not satisfied as a result of
the events which gave rise to the right to terminate pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)_), then the Company will pay to Buyer a termination fee of
$54,000,000 in cash in immediately available funds (the " _Company
Termination Fee_ "). In the event that Buyer receives full payment pursuant to
this _Section 7.4_, the receipt of the Company Termination Fee will be deemed
to be liquidated damages for any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
Parent and Buyer in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions (and the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of Parent, Buyer or any other Person will be entitled
to bring or maintain any Action against the Company or any of its respective
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the
Transactions (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination. The Parties understand that in no
event will the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion. For the avoidance of doubt, unless Buyer receives
the Company Termination Fee as provided in the first sentence above, nothing
in this Agreement limits Parents and Buyers right to seek specific
performance or other equitable relief.

 

(b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.4_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without these
agreements, neither Parent nor Buyer would enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 7.4_, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or
Buyer commences an Action which results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company will pay Parent or Buyer, as applicable, its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at
the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received.

 

VIII. INDEMNIFICATION

 

8.1 _Indemnification by the Company Indemnitors_. On the terms and subject to
the conditions of this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing, the
Company Indemnitors will severally defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and its Affiliates, officers, directors, managers, stockholders, employees and
assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and pay
or reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, any

 



39  and all losses or damages, including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
court costs, reasonable expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys fees
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), resulting from or arising out of:

(a) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in
_Section 3.9(d)_ or _Section 3.9(e)_ when made or at Closing or any breach
of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Section 3.6(a)_
or _Section 3.6(b)_ when made or at Closing, in each case by the Company
Indemnitor solely as to his, her or its Company Common Shares to the extent
such Company Indemnitor actually receives a financial benefit therefrom; or

 

(b) any breach by the Company of _Section 5.1(b)(iv)_ or _Section 5.1(b)(v)_
on or after the Effective Date, in any such case solely to the extent the
Company Indemnitor actually receives a financial benefit therefrom.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company Indemnitors will not be
required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for any Losses under this _Article
VIII_ in excess of their respective pro rata portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration received pursuant to the Merger and (ii) in no event will any
Buyer Indemnitee make any claim for indemnification under this _Section 8.1_
after the Survival Date. The indemnification obligations under this _Section
8.1_ constitute part of the consideration to induce Parent, Buyer and Merger
Sub to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the
Transactions.

8.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of
this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing, Parent and Buyer will
jointly and severally defend, indemnify and hold harmless the holders of
Company Common Stock and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
managers, members, direct or indirect shareholders, employees, heirs and
assigns (collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and
pay or reimburse the Company Indemnitees for any and all Losses resulting
from or arising out of:

(a) any breach of a representation or warranty of Parent or Buyer contained in
_Article IV_ when made or at Closing; or

(b) any breach by Parent or Buyer of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) _Notice and Opportunity to Defend
Claims_. If an event occurs that a Person entitled to indemnification with
respect thereto under this Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") asserts is
an indemnifiable event pursuant to _Section 8.1_ or _8.2_ , the Indemnified
Party seeking indemnification will notify the applicable Company Indemnitor
(in the case of a claim by a Buyer Indemnitee) or Buyer (in the case of a
claim by a Company Indemnitee) (in either such case, the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") promptly, but no later than 30 days, after such Indemnified Party
receives written notice, in the case of a third-party claim, or otherwise
becomes aware, in the case of a direct claim, of any such claim, event or
matter as to which indemnity may be sought, except that the failure of
the Indemnified Party to give notice as

 



40  provided in this _Section 8.3(a)_ will not relieve any Indemnifying Party
of its obligations under _Section 8.1_ or _8.2_ , except to the extent that
such failure materially prejudices the rights of any such Indemnifying Party.
Any notice of a claim, event or matter as to which indemnity may be sought
will include a reasonably detailed description of such claim, event or matter,
the basis of the claim for indemnification, copies of material documentation
reasonably accessible to or in the possession of the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnified Party believes supports such claim for indemnification and a
good faith estimate of the amount of Losses incurred or which reasonably
could be expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
such claim.

(b) _Third-Party Claims_. In the case of any claim asserted by a third party
against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party will give written notice
to the Indemnifying Party (or, with respect to a claim for which
indemnification is sought pursuant to  _Section 8.1_, the applicable Company
Indemnitor) of the third-party claim in accordance with _Section 8.3(a)_, and
the Indemnified Party will permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of
such Indemnifying Party) to assume (which assumption may be made under a
reservation of rights) the defense of any third-party claim or any litigation
with a third party resulting therefrom, except that (i) counsel for the
Indemnifying Party who conducts the defense of such claim or litigation will
be subject to the approval of the Indemnified Party (which approval will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (ii) the Indemnified
Party may participate in such defense at such Indemnified Partys expense.
Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, no
Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, will
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that provides
for injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party
or that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each
claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a general release from all
liability with respect to such claim or litigation. If the Indemnifying Party
does not assume the defense of any matter as above provided, the Indemnified
Party will have the right to defend such matter and to settle such matter,
except that the Indemnified Party may not settle such claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In any event, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense of
any third-party claim or litigation subject to this _Article VIII_ and will
each provide the other reasonable access to its records in order to facilitate
the defense and settlement of such matter.

 

8.4 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, the indemnification provided
for in this _Article VIII_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
any Party (including Company Indemnitees and Buyer Indemnitees) against
another Party or Company Indemnitor for any claims under or based upon this
Agreement or the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event
will Parent, Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnitee be entitled to offset any
amounts owed to it pursuant to this _Article VIII_ against any amounts owed by
Parent, Buyer, any Buyer Indemnitee, any Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates to any employee or former employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Contract.

 



41 8.5 _Additional Limitations on Indemnification_. (a) No Buyer Indemnitee or
Company Indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.1_ for any special, punitive or exemplary damages, any incidental or
consequential damages and any loss of future revenue, income or profits, or
any diminution of value or multiples of earnings damages.

(b) Each of the Buyer Indemnitees and the Company Indemnitees will use its
reasonable best efforts to mitigate all Losses for which such Indemnified
Parties are entitled or may be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(c) Any indemnifiable Loss hereunder will be calculated net of any (i)
insurance recoveries and (ii) recoveries from third parties pursuant to
indemnification or otherwise, in each case available to the Indemnified Party.
If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any claim pursuant to _Section
8.1_, the Indemnifying Party will be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance
benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Buyer
Indemnitee will be indemnified for any Loss to the extent (i) that reserves
therefor exist on the Financial Statements, or (ii) arising or resulting from
any change in applicable Law or accounting principles from and after the
Effective Date.

 

8.6 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any payment made pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ will be treated as an adjustment to the Closing Merger

to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of Delaware). The Parties hereby (a) submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) for
the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement
brought by any Party and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way
of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that they are
not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that
the property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such
Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Action is
improper or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or
by any of the above-named courts. Each of the Parties agrees that mailing of

 



53  process or other papers in connection with any action or proceeding in the
manner provided in _Section 10.3_ or such other manner as may be permitted by
Law will be valid and sufficient service of process. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees (on behalf of
itself, its Subsidiaries and the equityholders, directors, officers,
employees, consultants, financial advisors, accountants, legal counsel,
investment bankers, and other agents, advisors and representatives of each of
them) that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to any Financing or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

 

10.13 _Enforcement_. (a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Each Party agrees
that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other Party of
any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching
Party will be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available
to it whether in Law or equity, including monetary damages) to (i) a decree
or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant or obligation and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
will be entitled to the granting of a decree or order of specific performance
or other equitable relief to consummate the Merger (" _Closing Relief_ ") if
and only in the event that:

 

(i) except as provided in _Section 6.4_, all of the conditions in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ (other than those conditions in _Section 6.2_ that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or could be satisfied but
for a breach by Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub of any provisions hereof, but each
of which at such time is capable of being satisfied) have been satisfied or
waived; and

(ii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent and
Buyer that (A) it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and (B)
if the Closing Relief is granted, then the Closing will occur.

 

Upon the Company filing an Action for the Closing Relief in accordance with
the foregoing, the Company will not be required to comply with  _Section
5.1(b)(vii)_ or _Section 5.8 _and each subsection of _Section 5.1(b)_ shall
be subject to an ordinary course of business qualifier to the extent not
already specifically included in such subsection.

 



54 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and
Buyer will be entitled the Closing Relief if and only in the event that:

(i) except as provided in _Section 6.4_, all of the conditions in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ (other than those conditions in _Section 6.3_ that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or could be satisfied but for
a breach by the Company of any provisions hereof, but each of which at such
time is capable of being satisfied) have been satisfied or waived; and

(ii) Parent and Buyer have irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to the
Company that (A) they are ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing
and (B) if the Closing Relief is granted, then the Closing will occur.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, (1) while the Company may pursue both the
Closing Relief and the payment of the Buyer Termination Fee (only to the
extent expressly permitted by _Section 7.3_), under no circumstances will the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both the Closing Relief and
payment of the Buyer Termination Fee, and (2) while Parent and Buyer may
pursue both the Closing Relief and the payment of the Company Termination Fee
(only to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 7.4_), under no
circumstances will Parent and Buyer be permitted or entitled to receive both
the Closing Relief and payment of the Company Termination Fee.

(e) Each Party further agrees that (i) it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided in
this Agreement (including the limitations set forth in _Section 10.13(b)_ and
_Section 10.13(c)_) on the basis that any other Party has an adequate
remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity, (ii) no other Party or Person will be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 10.13_, and (iii) it irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

 

10.14 _Company Professional Advisors_. Each Party hereby acknowledges, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, that each of the Company
Professional Advisors may advise and represent the Company and its Affiliates
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, and that,
following consummation of the Transactions, each of the Company Professional
Advisors may advise and represent a Company Indemnitor or Company Indemnitors
or their respective Affiliates, if such Persons so request, in connection with
any Action or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and each Party hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict
of interest arising therefrom, and each Party and their respective Boards of
Directors (or committees thereof) will cause any Affiliate thereof to consent
to

 



55  and waive any conflict of interest arising from any such representation.
Buyer, for itself, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and for their
respective successors and assigns, irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that
all communications between the Company, the Shareholders and the Company
Professional Advisors that are legal counsel that were made in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement
which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged
communications of the Company, the Shareholders and their legal counsel and
would not be subject to disclosure to Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation in connection with any process relating to a dispute
arising under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, will continue
after the Closing to be privileged communications between such Persons and
such legal counsel, and none of Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through
Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation will seek to obtain
the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such
communications belongs to Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation.

 

10.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, BUYER, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY FINANCING OR THE ACTIONS
OF PARENT, BUYER, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY
FINANCING SOURCE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE).

 

10.16 _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Company (on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and the
equityholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, financial
advisors, accountants, legal counsel, investment bankers, and other agents,
advisors and representatives of each of them) acknowledges and agrees that it
(and such other Persons) will have no recourse against the Financing Sources,
and the Financing Sources will be subject to no liability or claims by the
Company (or such other Persons) in connection with the Financing or in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
