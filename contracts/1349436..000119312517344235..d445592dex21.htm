days immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing and Parent&#146;s receipt of written notification from the Exchange Agent of the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The Parties acknowledge that payment of
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting problems that

entitled to the relief provided by Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL, then (i)&nbsp;such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Appraisal Shares and (ii)&nbsp;the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such

Governmental Entity by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent determine that any amounts are required to be deducted or
withheld (other than any deduction or withholding with respect to any payments constituting compensation for services), the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent shall use reasonably commercial efforts to, prior to deducting or withholding
such amounts, notify the holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made and shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to establish or obtain any exemption from or reduction in the amount of any withholding that otherwise would be
required. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>ARTICLE IV </B></P>
