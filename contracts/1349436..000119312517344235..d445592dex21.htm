of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each whole share of capital stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and shall represent one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Entity, so that,
after the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Surviving Entitys common stock (other than any

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_ , each share of

(excluding any shares of Company Common Stock described in _clause (iii)_ and
_clause (iv_ ) of this  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ and any Appraisal Shares),
including for the avoidance of doubt any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time whose prior restrictions
have lapsed pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, shall be converted
automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive from Parent (A)
that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio (the 

 



19  " _Share Portion_ "), and (B) $19.20 in cash (the " _Cash Portion_ ", and
together with the Share Portion, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without
any interest thereon and subject to any withholding Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(j)_.

 

(ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall cease
to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist.
Each holder of any such share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with

(including any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_) and (B) any dividends
or other distributions in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_, in each
case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable.

 

(iii) All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
shares or by Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Parent or Merger Sub shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of
the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.

(iv) All shares of Company Common Stock held by any direct or indirect
subsidiary of the Company shall remain outstanding as common stock of the
Surviving Entity with appropriate adjustment to the number thereof to preserve
such Persons relative interest in the Surviving Entity.

 

(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc_. In the event of any change in (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock (including
options to purchase Company Common Stock) or (ii) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock (including options to
purchase Parent Common Stock), in each case issued and outstanding after the
date of this Agreement and prior the Effective Time by reason of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the Exchange
Ratio shall be equitably adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event and, as so adjusted, shall from and after the date of such event,
be used to determine the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_. Nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 3.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

 

3.2 _Treatment of Company Warrants; Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards_.

 

(a) Company Warrants shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the
Company Warrant Agreement. The Company shall notify the holders of the
Company Warrants of the Merger and the automatic exercise of the Company
Warrants in accordance with the terms of the Company Warrant Agreement.

 



20 (b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions as may be
required to effect the following:



     | (i) | adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options,
whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the Effective
Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into an option to acquire, subject to substantially
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock
Option, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share), determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Compensation Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company
Stock Option divided by (B) the Compensation Exchange Ratio (a " _Converted
Stock Option_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that notwithstanding this
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)(i),_ the terms of a Converted Stock Option will be
further adjusted (including further adjustments to the exercise price) as
required to comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | adjust the terms of all outstanding Company RSUs, other
than those Company RSUs held by a non-employee director of the Company (each,
a " _Director RSU_ "), as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time,
each Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than a Director RSU) shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award,
subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect
to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Compensation Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole share (a " _Converted RSU_ "); 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

adjust the terms of all outstanding Director RSUs as necessary to provide
that, at the Effective Time, each Director RSU outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall vest in full and shall be canceled and converted
into the right to receive, for each share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Director RSU, the  

---|---|--- 
 



21 practicable following, but in no event later than ten business days after, the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any such payments
would cause an impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A of the
Code, such amounts shall become vested at the Effective Time and will be paid
at the earliest time such payment would not cause an impermissible
acceleration event under Section 409A of the Code; 
---|--- 



     | (iv) | adjust the terms of any Company Stock Option or Company RSU
(other than a Director RSU) to provide that in the event the holder of any
Converted Stock Option or Converted RSU experiences a termination of
employment by Parent or the Company without Cause or by the holder for Good
Reason (each, as defined in the Companys Change in Control and Severance
Plan) during the eighteen (18)-month period following the Effective Time, all
then-unvested Converted Stock Options and Converted RSUs held by such holder
will immediately vest; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | make such other changes to the Company Stock Plan as the
Company and Parent may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
 

The adjustments provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_ with respect to
Company Stock Options, whether or not such Company Stock Options are
"incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), are
intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of
the Code.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all the obligations of the
Company under the Company Stock Plan, each outstanding Converted Stock Option
and Converted RSU and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of
Converted Stock Options and Converted RSUs appropriate notices setting
forth such holders rights, and the agreements evidencing the grants of such
Converted Stock Options and Converted RSUs shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_ after giving effect to the Merger).

(d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise or settlement of the Converted Stock Options and Converted RSUs in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor or, to the extent applicable, other appropriate form)
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Converted Stock
Options and Converted RSUs and shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Converted Stock Options and Converted RSUs remain outstanding.

 



22 3.3 _Payment for Securities; Exchange_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
enter into an agreement with an entity designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and to receive
the Merger Consideration and all cash payable pursuant to this  _Article
III_. On the Closing Date and prior to the filing of the Certificate of
Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_ through the Exchange Agent, (i) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holders and (ii) sufficient
cash to make delivery of the Cash Portion to such holders and to make
payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_. In
addition, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, cash
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.3(g)_, if any. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of
the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_, the Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Entity shall pay all charges
and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Any
interest or other income resulting from investment of the cash portion of the
Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.



     | (i) | As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
but in no event more than three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date,
Parent and the Surviving Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver
to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of (A)
an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (B) shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent
and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration. 
---|---|--- 
 



23 or Book-Entry Shares, delivery of a duly completed and validly executed Letter
of Transmittal, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange therefor (A) one or
more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-
entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by such holder)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.1_ (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held
by such holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (B) a check
in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ and this _Article III_ ,
including cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other distributions
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, it
shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Entity that such Taxes either have been paid
or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section_
__ _ 3.3(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_. 
---|---|--- 

(c) _Termination Rights_. All Merger Consideration, dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(g)_, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ paid upon the surrender of and in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall cause the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity to be
closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity of the shares of 

 



24  Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing
shares of Company Common Stock described in _clause (iii)_ of _Section_ __ _
3.1(b)_), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_
and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_, without any interest thereon.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the date
that is 12 months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving
Entity, upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who
have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_, in each case without interest thereon, shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity and Parent for payment of their
claim for such amounts.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Entity, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Law.
If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the
time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than
a Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in _clause
(iii)_ of _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent or the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Entity may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_., in each case, without any interest
thereon.

 



25 (g) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with
respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be
entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
3.3_. Following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, such
holder of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor,
shall be promptly paid, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such payment date
following such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in
respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates, scrip or
shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a
share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average
price of Parent Common Stock for the five consecutive trading days
immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing and Parents receipt of
written notification from the Exchange Agent of the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of
fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The
Parties acknowledge that payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
simplifying the corporate and accounting problems that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional share of Parent Common Stock.

(i) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled
to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, but instead
at the Effective Time shall become entitled to payment of the fair value of
such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and
at the Effective Time all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall

 



26  cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon cease to constitute Appraisal Shares and (ii) the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and cease and if such forfeiture
shall occur following the Effective Time, each such Appraisal Share shall
thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and the
Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with respect
to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to the Appraisal Shares
without the prior written consent of Parent.

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from
the amounts otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts required to be deducted or withheld with
respect to the making of such payments under applicable Law. To the extent
that amounts are so properly deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity
or Parent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding
was made by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case
may be. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent determine that
any amounts are required to be deducted or withheld (other than any deduction
or withholding with respect to any payments constituting compensation for
services), the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity or Parent shall use
reasonably commercial efforts to, prior to deducting or withholding such
amounts, notify the holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made and shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to establish or obtain
any exemption from or reduction in the amount of any withholding that
otherwise would be required.

valid, binding or enforceable or to be in full force and effect as would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect and (ii) except insofar as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, or by
principles governing the availability of equitable remedies, whether
considered in a Proceeding at law or in equity. As of the date of this
Agreement, there is no default under any Company Specified Contract by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
other party thereto, and no

 



38  event has occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
would constitute a default thereunder by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, in each case
except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.15 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no claim, suit,
action, investigation or proceeding of any nature, civil, criminal or
regulatory, in law or equity, by or before any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To

material Proceeding in connection with his or her status as such.

4.16 _Compliance with Laws_.

 

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters and environmental matters and as set
forth in Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries is, and since January 1, 2016 has been,
in compliance with all, and is not in default under or in violation of any
applicable Law, other than any noncompliance, default or violation that
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any written communication since December 31, 2016 and
prior to the date of this Agreement from a Governmental Entity that alleges
that the Company or any Company Subsidiary is not in compliance with or is in
default or violation of any applicable Law, except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of the Company, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending or
threatened, other than those the outcome of which has not had and would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Entity necessary under applicable Law to own, lease and operate
their assets and properties and to lawfully carry on their businesses as they
are being conducted as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to be in possession of such
Company Permits would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the
Company Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened and
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with all such
Company Permits, except where such suspension, cancellation or noncompliance
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



39 4.17 _Environmental Matters_.

 

(a) Except for matters that would not reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect:

 

(i) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are, and for the past three (3)
years have been, in compliance with all Environmental Laws, which compliance
has included obtaining and complying with all Environmental Permits required
for the operation of the business;

(ii) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
notice from any Governmental Entity or other Person alleging the actual or
potential violation of or liability under any Environmental Law or any
Environmental Permit, in each case which remains pending or unresolved;

(iii) There are no Proceedings or Judgments pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened by a Governmental Entity or other Person against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that allege a violation of or liability
under any Environmental Law or any Environmental Permit;

 

(iv) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has treated, stored,
disposed of, arranged for the disposal of, transported, handled, or Released
any Hazardous Material so as to give rise to any liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) pursuant to Environmental Laws; and

(v) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has provided an indemnity
with respect to, or otherwise assumed by Contract, any liability of any other
Person relating to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials.

 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent and Merger Sub all non-privileged
material environmental reports, audits and assessments and all other material
documents bearing on material environmental, health or safety liabilities, in
each case in the possession or reasonable control of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

 

4.18 _Intellectual Property_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own or
have the right to use all Intellectual Property necessary for the operation
of the businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as presently
conducted (collectively, the " _Company Intellectual Property_ ") free and
clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens, except where the failure to
own or have the right to use such Intellectual Property would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
the use of the Company Intellectual Property by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in the operation of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as presently conducted does not infringe upon or misappropriate
any Intellectual Property of any other Person, except for such matters that
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



40 4.19 _Insurance_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintain, or
are entitled to the benefits of, insurance, underwritten by financially
reputable insurance companies, in such amounts and against such risks
substantially as is customary for the industries in which the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries operate. Section 4.19 of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a complete and correct list of all insurance policies maintained by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, true and complete copies of which
have been made available to Parent. All material insurance policies
maintained by or on behalf of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries as of
the date of this Agreement are in full force and effect, and all premiums due
on such policies have been paid. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and
provisions of all insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in breach or default under, or has taken
any action that would permit termination or material modification of, any
material insurance policies. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the
limits for any such policy currently in force have been exhausted or
materially reduced.

 

4.20 _Regulatory Matters_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
(a) an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment
company" within the meaning of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or (b) a "holding company," a
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company," an Affiliate of a "holding
company," a "public utility" or a "public-utility company," as each such term
is defined in the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns or holds any refined petroleum
product, crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, natural gas liquid and
other pipelines, lateral lines, pumps, pump stations, storage facilities,
terminals, processing plants and other related operations, assets, machinery
or equipment that are subject to (x) regulation by the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 or (y) rate regulation
or comprehensive nondiscriminatory access regulation under the Laws of any
state or other local jurisdiction.

4.21 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person, other than Evercore Group L.L.C., the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by the Company, is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its affiliates.

 

4.22 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the opinion of
Evercore Group L.L.C., dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that,
as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set
forth therein, the consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such holders from a financial
point of view, a signed copy of which opinion will be made available to Parent
for informational purposes only promptly following the date of this Agreement.

 



41 4.23 _Related Party Transactions_. Except as disclosed in the Filed Company
SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is party to any
transaction or arrangement under which any (a) present or former executive
officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (b) beneficial
owner (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 5% or more
of any class of equity of the Company or (c) Affiliate, "associate" or member
of the "immediate family" (as such terms are respectively defined in Rules
12b-2 and 16a-1 of the Exchange Act) of any of the foregoing is a party to any
actual or proposed loan, lease or other Contract with or binding upon the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or owns or has any interest in any of their
respective properties or assets, in each case as would be required to be
disclosed by the Company pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated

date of this Agreement were entered into in accordance with applicable Laws,
and in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk
management and other policies, practices and procedures employed by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and were entered into with
counterparties believed at the time to be financially responsible and able to
understand (either alone or in consultation with their advisers) and to bear
the risk of such Derivative Transactions.

(b) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has duly performed in
all respects all of their respective obligations under the Derivative
Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and
there are no breaches, violations, collateral deficiencies, requests for
collateral or demands for payment or defaults or allegations or assertions of
such by any party thereunder.

4.25 _No Other Representations or Warranties; Reliance Disclaimer_. Except
for the representations and warranties set forth in this _Article IV_ , none
of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any other Person makes or has made
any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided
to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives,
disclaims reliance on any representations or warranties or other information
provided to them by Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives or any other Person except for the representations and

of the foregoing, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives, acknowledges and
agrees that none of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any other Person will
have or be subject to any liability or other obligation to the Company or any

information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other material made available to the Company in certain "data rooms" or
management presentations in expectation of the Merger.

Except (y) as disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents filed by Parent with or furnished by Parent to the SEC on or after

SEC Documents in any risk factor section, any forward-looking disclosure or
any other statements that are non-specific, predictive or primarily
cautionary in nature other than historical facts included therein and solely

such failure would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the

Parent Subsidiaries (a) has full power and authority necessary to enable
it to own, operate, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
conduct its business as presently conducted and (b) is duly qualified or
licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where the failure

Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of Parents Organizational
Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement are included in the Filed
Parent SEC Documents. There are not any stockholder agreements, voting trusts
or other agreements to which Parent is a party or by which it is bound

Date to the date of this Agreement, there have been no issuances by Parent of
shares of capital stock of Parent or options, warrants, convertible or
exchangeable securities, stock-based performance units or other rights to
acquire shares of capital stock of Parent or other rights that give the holder
thereof any economic interest of a nature accruing to the holders of Parent
Common Stock, other than the rights under the Parent Warrant Agreement or
rights under the Parent Stock Plan.

 



43 (b) All outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, and all such shares that
may be issued prior to the Effective Time when issued, (i) are or will be, as
applicable, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
not subject to preemptive rights and (ii) issued in compliance in all material
respects with applicable securities Laws and other applicable Law and all
requirements set forth in applicable Contracts.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no bonds, debentures, notes

options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities, stock-based
performance units or other rights or Contracts to which Parent is a party or
by which Parent is bound (i) obligating Parent to issue, deliver or sell, or

or any security convertible or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock
of, Parent or any Voting Parent Debt, (ii) obligating Parent to issue, grant
or enter into, as applicable, any such option, warrant, security, unit, right
or Contract or (iii) that give any person the right to receive any economic
interest of any nature accruing to the holders of Parent Common Stock. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual obligations
of Parent to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock of Parent or options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities,
stock-based performance units or other rights to acquire shares of capital
stock of Parent, except for (A) the withholding of shares of Parent Common
Stock to satisfy tax obligations with respect to awards granted pursuant to
the Parent Stock Plan and (B) the acquisition by Parent of Parent
Restricted Shares in connection with the forfeiture of awards of such.

(e) All Parent Restricted Shares are evidenced by written award agreements. 

5.3 _Parent Subsidiaries; Equity Interests_.

 

(a) A full list of all Parent Subsidiaries is set forth in Section 5.3(a) of
the Parent Disclosure Letter. All of the outstanding interests in each Parent
Subsidiary have been validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are
owned by Parent, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no options, warrants,
rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, stock-based performance units
or Contracts to which any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which any Parent
Subsidiary is bound obligating any Parent Subsidiary to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock of, or any security convertible or exchangeable for any shares of

interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity
interest in any Person. None of Parent nor Merger Sub or

 



44  any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" is, and at no time
during the last three years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the
Company (in each case, as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL).
As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub "owns" (as
such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) any shares of capital stock
of the Company other than as a result of this Agreement.

Issuance, to receipt of Parent Stockholder Approval. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms (except insofar as such enforceability may be

general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, or by
principles governing the availability of equitable remedies, whether
considered in a Proceeding at law or in equity).

hereby, which consent shall become effective immediately following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 



45 5.5 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement do
not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the terms hereof will
not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancelation or acceleration of any material obligation or to

any of the properties or assets of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries under,
any provision of (i) the Organizational Documents of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, (ii) any Contract to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or

(a) Since January 1, 2016, Parent has filed or furnished with the SEC all
forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements required to
be filed or furnished under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. At the
time filed (or, in the case of registration statements, solely on the dates of

SEC Document prior to the date of this Agreement, in which case as of the date
of such amendment), each Filed Parent SEC Document complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as the case may be and did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited quarterly

by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement will, at

either by reason of any action or failure to act, that would reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of any such qualification, registration or tax-
exempt status, except where such loss of qualification, registration or tax-
exempt status would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) None of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, or any of their respective ERISA

to all other real and personal properties that are material to the business
of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all
Liens and defects and imperfections of title except (a) such as do not

with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries, (b) for Permitted Liens and (c) such as would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, there does not

enforceable or to be in full force and effect as would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect and (ii) except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, or by principles
governing the availability of equitable remedies, whether considered in a
Proceeding at law or in equity. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
Knowledge of Parent, there is no default under any Parent Specified Contract

and is not in default under or in violation of any applicable Law, other than
any noncompliance, default or violation that would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received any written
communication since December 31, 2016 and prior to the date of this Agreement
from a Governmental Entity that alleges that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
is not in compliance with or is in default or violation of any applicable Law,
except where such non-compliance, default or violation would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Entity necessary under applicable Law to own, lease and operate their assets
and properties and to lawfully carry on their businesses as they are being
conducted as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Parent
Permits_ "), except where the failure to be in possession of such Parent
Permits would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in full force

the Knowledge of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, the use of Parent
Intellectual Property by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in the operation

Subsidiaries shall not be required (and without the prior consent of Parent,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not), take any action with
respect to any order or any applicable Law or in order to obtain any approval
or resolve any objection or impediment under any Antitrust Law which is not

Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period in respect of such amended Parent
Superior Proposal, except that if the only change to the Parent Superior
Proposal is a change in price, then the Parent Superior Proposal Notice
Period shall be 24 hours after notification of such change to the Company; and

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to a Parent
Intervening Event that occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement,
Parent may, if the Parent Board (or any committee thereof) so chooses, effect
a Parent Change in Recommendation if, prior to taking such action, (i) the
Parent Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Parent Boards duties under applicable
Law; (ii) Parent shall have given written notice to the Company that Parent
has determined that a Parent Intervening Event has occurred or arisen (which
notice will (A) describe such Parent Intervening Event and (B) inform the
Company that Parent intends to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation) (such
notice being referred to herein as a " _Parent Intervening Event Notice_ ");
(iii) Parent has negotiated, and has used its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives to negotiate, in good

 



69 negotiate, during the period starting on the date the Company receives the
Parent Intervening Event Notice and ending at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on the
fourth Business Day following such receipt (such period of time, a " _Parent
Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), with respect to any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company; and (iv) at the end of such
Parent Intervening Event Notice Period, the Parent Board (or any committee
thereof), after consultation with its outside legal counsel, shall have
considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by
the Company, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such proposed changes
do not obviate the need for the Parent Board to effect a Parent Change in
Recommendation and that the failure to make a Parent Change in Recommendation
would be inconsistent with the Parent Boards duties under applicable Law.

the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby under the Securities Act

70  has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the

Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy

Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent.

with this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by
the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Parent
Superior Proposal or Parent Alternative Proposal, by any Parent Change in
Recommendation. Except as otherwise expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _

6.8 _Access_ _to_ _Information:_ _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable prior notice,
each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to afford to the
Other Party and their respective Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to (and, with respect to books and records, the right to
copy) all of its and its Subsidiaries officers, key employees, agents,
properties, offices, commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence
(in each case, whether in physical or electronic form). Each Party shall
furnish promptly to the Other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule and
other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including
"comment letters") received by such Party from the SEC concerning compliance

the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
customers, suppliers, lenders and other creditors to be available to the
Other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing

 



73  provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_, (i) each Party shall not be
required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant such access if such
Party reasonably determines that it would (A) materially disrupt or impair

constitute a violation of any Contract with respect to confidentiality

of such consent, the Other Party shall be granted access to the properties
and facilities of such Party for the purpose of conducting any visual
inspections and assessments at such times and in such a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with the Other Partys business. The Company and Parent
will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances
in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply..

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of September 11, 2017 between
Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all

execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company will not, and
each of the foregoing will use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other
public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, without the prior written consent of the Other Party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided, however,_
that a Party or its Representatives may issue a public announcement or other
public disclosures required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon
which such Partys or its parent entitys capital stock is traded, _provided_
such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the Other Party an
opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure and provide
reasonable comments regarding same; _provided, further_ , that the Company
shall not be required by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ to consult with any Other
Party with respect to a public announcement in connection with the receipt and
existence of an Alternative Proposal and the publication of any press release
or announcement with respect to a Company Change in Recommendation made in
accordance with Section 6.4 or a Parent Change in Recommendation made in
accordance with Section 6.5; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
shall permit Parent to review in advance and incorporate their reasonable
comments into any material communication to be given by the Company to any
current employee, contractor or consultant with respect to (i) the Merger,
(ii) the impact of the Merger on such individuals service relationship with
the Company or Parent, or (iii) the impact of the Merger on any Parent Benefit
Plans or Company Benefit Plans.

 



74 6.10 _Takeover Laws_. None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub will take
any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them
will take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from
the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.11 _Third-Party Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to prepare all documentation, to
effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Entities and third parties necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with
the terms and conditions of such permits (including Environmental Permits),
consents, approvals and authorizations and to cause the Merger to be
consummated as expeditiously as practicable. Each of Parent and the Company
has the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to
the exchange of information, with respect to, all material written
information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Entities in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the Parties hereto agrees to act reasonably
and promptly. Each Party hereto agrees that it will consult with the Other
Party with respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and each Party will keep the Other Party apprised of the status of
material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company agrees, upon request, to furnish the Other
Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and equityholders and such other matters as may reasonably be
necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement or any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such Other Parties or any of such Other Partys Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) This _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall not apply to (i) approval under Antitrust
Laws or (ii) approval of the SEC of the Registration Statement and Joint
Proxy Statement.

6.12 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Companys Organizational Documents, or,
if applicable, the Company Subsidiaries Organizational Documents, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been or becomes at
any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary and also with respect to any such Person, in such
Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other Benefit Plan or enterprise (regardless of whether
such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with the Company) serving at the
request of or on behalf of the

 



75  Company or any Company Subsidiary and together with such Persons heirs,
executors or administrators (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ " _)_
to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by, and subject to the
conditions and procedures set forth in, applicable Law in connection with any
Proceeding and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
Indemnification Expenses, Judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom;
and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) days after any request
for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any
Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with
respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Proceeding in
advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, including payment on
behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification
Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any
rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case
without the requirement of any bond or other security, _provided_ , _however_
, the payment of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party
in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon
delivery to the Surviving Entity of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Party to repay all amounts so paid in advance if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified. The indemnification and advancement obligations of the
Surviving Entity pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ extend to acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Proceeding
relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection
therewith and any Proceeding relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue as to any
Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement and inure
to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_, upon learning of
any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Entity (but the failure so to
notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it may have under
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_, except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such partys position with respect to such claims). As used in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_: (x) the term " _Indemnification Expenses_ " means
reasonable and documented out of pocket attorneys fees and expenses and all
other reasonable and documented out of pocket costs, expenses and obligations
(including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript
fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including
on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or
participate in, any Proceeding for which indemnification is required to be
provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_, including any Proceeding
relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an
Indemnified Party; and (y) the phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by applicable Law" includes, but is not limited to (1) to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by any provision of the DGCL that
authorizes or permits additional indemnification by agreement or otherwise, or
the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DGCL and
(2) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or
replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this Agreement that
increase the extent to which an entity may indemnify its directors, officers,
trustees, employees, 

 



76  agents, or fiduciaries or persons serving in any capacity in which any
Indemnified Party serves, _provided that_ any amendment, alteration or repeal
of the DGCL that adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be
prospective only and does not limit or eliminate any such right with respect
to any Proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action
or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Entity will settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any Judgment in any actual or threatened Proceeding in respect of
which indemnification has been sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder
unless such settlement, compromise or Judgment includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
Proceeding without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Companys
Organizational Documents or the Company Subsidiaries Organizational
Documents will be assumed by the Surviving Entity in the Merger, without
further action, at the Effective Time and will survive the Merger and continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(c) Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the Surviving Entitys
Organizational Documents and each Company Subsidiarys Organizational
Documents will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitations on
liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Companys
Organizational Document and such Company Subsidiarys Organizational
Documents, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior
to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is
required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law;
_provided, however,_ that any such modification shall be prospective only and
shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Proceeding
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to modification; and _provided further_  that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding made within such period
continue until the disposition of such Proceeding.

 

(d) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will maintain in
full effect the current directors and officers liability and fiduciary
liability insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (but may
substitute therefor other policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to
the Indemnified Parties so long as that substitution does not result in gaps
or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring on or before the
Effective Time, but Parent is not required to pay annual premiums in excess of
300% of the last annual premiums paid therefor prior to the date of this
Agreement and will purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be
obtained for that amount if the coverage described in this _Section_ __ _
6.12(d)_ would cost in excess of that amount. The Company may, on or prior to
the Effective Time, purchase a tail policy with respect to acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were
committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Parties in
their capacity as such.

 



77 (e) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_. 

(f) Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Entity under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_.

(g) This _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ survives the consummation of the Merger and
is intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and personal representatives,
and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving Entity and their respective
successors and assigns.

 

6.13 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of Parent (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act. Prior to taking the actions required by this _Section_ __ _
6.13_, (a) the Company will provide Parent copies of any resolutions or other
documentation with respect to such actions and the Company shall give
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent and (b) Parent will provide the Company copies of any
resolutions or other documentation with respect to such actions and Parent
shall give consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company.

 

6.14 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one year after the Effective Time (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, provide to
each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who is an employee
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time other than an employee whose terms and conditions of employment
are governed by a collective bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions
of which shall be respected by Parent and the Surviving Entity (the "
_Continuing Employee_ "), for so long as the Continuing Employee is employed
by the Surviving Entity during the Continuation Period, (i) base cash
compensation and bonus and incentive opportunities (including the value
attributable to equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than
those that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee under the
applicable severance Benefit Plans, programs, policies, agreements and
arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or the
severance Benefit Plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements of
Parent or the Surviving Entity as in effect at the time of termination of
employment, whichever is greater, and (iii) employee Benefit Plans and
arrangements (other than base cash compensation, bonus and incentive
opportunities and severance benefits) to Continuing Employees that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 



78 (b) To the extent that participants in the Companys 2017 annual cash bonus
plan (the " _MIP_ ") have not been paid their 2017 annual bonus at the
Effective Time, Parent shall pay, or cause its Subsidiaries to pay, each
Qualified Continuing Employee (as defined below) who is a participant in the
MIP (i) such Qualified Continuing Employees target bonus for 2017 as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time if the Effective Time occurs
prior to December 31, 2017, or (ii) the Qualified Continuing Employees actual
bonus for 2017 as calculated based on the Companys performance through
December 31, 2017, if the Effective Time occurs after December 31, 2017 (the "
_2017 Bonus_ "). The 2017 Bonus shall be paid in cash on or before March 1,
2018 to each Qualified Continuing Employee. A " _Qualified Continuing
Employee_ " means each Continuing Employee (A) who is employed at the end of
the applicable performance period under the MIP or (B) whose employment with
the Surviving Entity was terminated by the Surviving Entity for a reason
other than "cause" or who terminated employment with the Surviving Entity for

(c) Parent shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to permit each
Continuing Employee to either continue to participate from and after the

eligible to participate in a Company Benefit Plan and instead provides for
such Continuing Employee to be eligible to participate in a Benefit Plan
sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates (the "
_Replacement Plans_ "), if such Replacement Plan is a group health plan,
Parent shall credit (or cause to be credited) such Continuing Employee, for
the year during which such coverage under such Replacement Plan begins, with
any deductibles and copayments already incurred during such year under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan. Parent, the Surviving Entity, their
Affiliates, and the Replacement Plans shall recognize each Continuing
Employees years of service and level of seniority with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (including service and seniority with any other employer
that was recognized by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) for purposes
of terms of employment and eligibility, vesting and benefit determination
(but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit or retiree welfare
arrangement) under the Replacement Plans. Parent shall cause each Replacement
Plan to waive any preexisting condition exclusion or restriction with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to a Continuing
Employee to the extent such exclusion or restriction did not apply with
respect to such employee under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity
and its Subsidiaries to honor their respective obligations under all
employment, severance, change in control and other agreements, if any, between
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and an individual employed prior to
the Closing Date by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, but subject to
any provisions thereof related to termination or amendment of such
agreements.

 



79 (e) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Continuing Employee is entitled during the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent or its applicable Affiliate will
assume and honor all vacation and other paid time off days accrued or earned
but not yet taken by such Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be
construed as amending, any benefit or compensation plan, program, Contract,
arrangement or agreement sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ are for the sole benefit of the Parties and
nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary), other than the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 

6.15 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any litigation or other
Proceeding of any stockholder related to this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is initiated or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and/or the members of the Company Board (or of any
equivalent governing body of any Company Subsidiary) prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such litigation or other
Proceeding and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis with
respect to the status thereof. The Company shall consult with Parent on a

Parent. In the event that any litigation or other Proceeding of
any stockholder related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other

of Parent, threatened against any of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary and/or
the members of the Parent Board (or of any equivalent governing body of any
Parent Subsidiary) prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall promptly notify
the Company of any such litigation or other Proceeding and shall keep the
Company reasonably informed on a current basis with respect to the status
thereof.

6.16 _Listing Application_. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause
the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing
on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of
issuance. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in connection with the
foregoing, including by providing information reasonably requested by Parent
in connection therewith.

6.17 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company, on one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to the
other of (a) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate or (b) the failure by it to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification will be required unless such untruth, inaccuracy or failure
to comply or satisfy would result in the failure

 



80  of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _
7.2(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_; _provided_
_further_ , _however_ that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. In
addition, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any fact, event or
circumstance known to the Company that is reasonably likely, individually or
taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to the
Company, to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company of any fact, event or circumstance known to
Parent that is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with
all other facts, events and circumstances known to Parent, to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

6.18 _Directors of Parent Following the Effective Time_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary corporate action (a) so that
upon and after the Effective Time, the size of the Parent Board is increased
by one member, (b) to appoint to the Parent Board one individual who has been

gas industry in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, as mutually

"), to fill the vacancy on the Parent Board created by such increase at the
Effective Time and (c) nominate the New Director for election to the Parent
Board in the proxy statement relating to the first annual meeting of the

prohibited; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ is not available to the Company, on the one hand, or

(c) by Parent if (i) the Company has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of the Company becomes

breach, failure to perform or untruth if it was continuing as of the Closing
Date would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ to be satisfied and such breach, failure to
perform or untruth is incapable of being cured (or becoming true) or, if

true) by the earlier of (x) the Outside Date or (y) within 30 days following
receipt by the Company of notice of such breach, failure or untruth from
Parent, _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ shall not be available if Parent is itself in
breach or has failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or any representation or

failure to perform or untruth if it was continuing as of the Closing Date
would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ to be satisfied and such breach,
failure to perform or untruth is incapable of being cured (or becoming true)
or, if capable of being cured (or becoming true), is not cured (or does not

following receipt by Parent of notice of such breach, failure or untruth from

is due to an Antitrust Law) or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ shall not have been
satisfied but all other conditions to Closing shall have been satisfied (or
in the case of conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, shall be capable of being satisfied or waived by all parties entitled
to the benefit of such conditions), such date may be extended by Parent or
the Company from time to time by written notice to the other party up to a
date that is no later than eight months from the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(e) is not available to the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the

9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of
Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of
the Other Party, except that (a) Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, (b) Parent may
assign any of its rights (but not delegate any of its obligations) under this
Agreement to one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent but, in each
case, no such assignment shall relieve Parent of any of its obligations
hereunder and (c) the Company may assign any of its rights (but not delegate
any of its obligations) under _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ to one or more wholly owned
Subsidiaries, but no such assignment shall relieve the Company of any of its
obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_ shall be null and void.

 

9.5 _Entire Understanding: No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
together with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other documents and
instruments executed pursuant hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the Parties with respect to the matters therein and herein
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings on such matters.
The provisions of this Agreement are binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties hereto and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, their respective
successors and assigns, and no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors
except, following the Effective Time, (a) as provided in _Section_ __ _
6.12_ (which will be to the benefit of the Persons referred to in such
Section) and (b) the rights of holders of Company Common Stock to receive the
Merger Consideration.

 



89 9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions of
this Agreement in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision
of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.
If a final Judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any
term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it
in the prior sentence, the Parties agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

OR IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND HEREBY WAIVE, AND

INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT THAT IT IS NOT
SUBJECT THERETO OR THAT SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR
IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN SAID COURTS OR THAT VENUE THEREOF MAY NOT BE
APPROPRIATE OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED
IN OR BY SUCH COURTS, AND THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH
RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
EXCLUSIVELY BY SUCH A DELAWARE STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. THE PARTIES HEREBY
CONSENT TO AND GRANT ANY SUCH COURT JURISDICTION OVER THE PERSON OF SUCH
PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF SUCH DISPUTE AND AGREE THAT MAILING OF
PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN
THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION _ _9.3_ OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE
PERMITTED BY LAW SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF.

UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (III)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.7_.

9.8 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as
Parties hereto and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney
or representative of any Party hereto has any liability for any obligations
or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

9.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the
parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_
, it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an

competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
9.9_, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
under the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party accordingly

of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such
Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section_
__ _ 9.9_. Each Party further agrees that neither the Other Party nor any
other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, and each party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

9.10 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the
Surviving Entity when due.

 



91 9.11 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and Parent may, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of the Other Party; (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Other Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the Other Party
contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a
Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.

 

9.12 _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificates or other documents delivered prior to or as
of the Effective Time shall survive until (but not beyond) the Effective Time.
The covenants and agreements of the Parties (including the Surviving Entity)

which, by their terms, contemplate a shorter survival period).

place, either within or without the State of Delaware, and at such time and
date as the Board of Directors shall determine. The Board of Directors may, in
its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not be held at any
place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as
described in Section 2.3 of these Bylaws in accordance with Section 211(a)(2)
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Stockholders may act
by written consent to elect directors.

 

Section 2.2 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders, unless
otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called by the Chairman of the Board
of Directors, the President or by resolution of the Board of Directors. Notice

Bylaws. Unless otherwise permitted by law, business transacted at any special
meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purpose stated in the notice.

Section 2.3 _Meetings by Remote Communications_. If authorized by the Board
of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and
procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders
not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote
communication:

(a) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether
such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote
communication,

_provided_ that:

 

(i) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each
person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote
communication is a stockholder or proxyholder;

(ii) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such
stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an
opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting
substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and

(iii) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the
meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other
action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

Section 2.4  _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice or electronic
transmission, in the manner provided in Section 232 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, of notice of the meeting, which shall state the
place, if any, date and time of the meeting, and the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a
special meeting, the purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be mailed
to or transmitted electronically to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote thereat. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, such notice shall be given not less than 10
days nor more than 60 days before the date of any such meeting. If mailed,
notice to stockholders shall be deemed given when deposited in the mail,
postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholders address as
it appears on the records of the Corporation.

Section 2.5  _Quorum_. Unless otherwise required by law or the Certificate of
Incorporation, the holders of a majority in voting power of the issued and
outstanding stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all
meetings of stockholders. When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting,
the quorum is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any stockholders. In
the absence of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by a majority in
voting power thereof, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner
provided in Section 2.10 of these Bylaws until a quorum shall attend. Shares
of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a
majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such
other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall
neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or
any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to
its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity. Section 2.6 _Voting_. Each holder of the Corporations common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, shall be entitled to one vote for each share held by
such holder. All elections of directors shall be determined by a plurality of
the votes cast, and except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, all other matters shall be determined by a
majority of the votes cast. Unless determined by the Chairman of the meeting
to be advisable, the vote on any matter, including the election of directors,
need not be by written ballot.

 

Section 2.7 _Proxy Representation_. Any stockholder may authorize another
person or persons to act for him by proxy in all matters in which a
stockholder is entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice of any
meeting, voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing consent or
dissent without a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder or by
his attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years
from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall
be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long
as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by
attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary
of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later
date.

Section 2.8  _Organization_.

(a) The Chairman of the Board of Directors, if one is elected, or, in his or
her absence or disability, the President of the Corporation, shall preside at
all meetings of the stockholders.

(b) The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as Secretary at all meetings
of the stockholders. In the absence or disability of the Secretary, the
Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President shall appoint a person to
act as Secretary at such meetings.

 

Section 2.9 _Conduct of Meeting_. The date and time of the opening and the
closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at
a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the
meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and
regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall
deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and
regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding over
any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and
to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures
and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are
appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or
procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the
presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the
following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the
meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and
the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or
participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation,
their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the
presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry
to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v)
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The
presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any
other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting,
shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a   matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such
presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare
to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before
the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent
determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting,
meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
the rules of parliamentary procedure.

Section 2.10 _Adjournment_. At any meeting of stockholders of
the Corporation, whether or not a quorum is present, a majority in voting
power of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to
time without notice. Any business may be transacted at the adjourned meeting
that might have been transacted at the meeting originally noticed. If the
adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting
shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Section 2.11  _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_.

(a) Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any
action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders
of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth
the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to
vote thereon were present and voted.

(b) Any electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken
and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons
authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be
written, signed and dated for the purposes of these Bylaws to the extent
permitted by law. Any such consent shall be delivered in accordance with
Section 228(d)(1) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have
not consented in writing or electronic transmission and who, if the action had
been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if
the record date of such meeting had been the date that written consents
signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take the action were
delivered to the Corporation as provided by law.

 

(c) Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing
may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all
purposes for which the original writing could be used.

STOCK 

Section 5.1 _Certificates of Stock_. The shares of the Corporation shall be

provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or
series of stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not
apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is
surrendered to the Corporation. Every holder of stock represented by
certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name
of the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors,
if any, or the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an
Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the
Corporation certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the

facsimile. The Board of Directors shall have the power to appoint one or more

certificates of stock of any class, and may require stock certificates to be
countersigned or registered by one or more of such transfer agents and/or
registrars.

Section 5.2 _Transfer of Shares_. Shares of stock of the Corporation shall be
transferable upon its books by the holders thereof, in person or by their duly
authorized attorneys or legal representatives, upon surrender and delivery to
the Corporation of the certificate representing such shares and a duly
executed instrument authorizing transfer of such shares, if certificated, or
delivery of a duly executed instrument authorizing transfer of such shares, if
uncertificated, to the person in charge of the stock and transfer books and
ledgers. If certificated, such certificates shall be cancelled and new
certificates shall thereupon be issued. A record shall  be made of each transfer. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for
collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry

and transferee request the Corporation to do so. The Board of Directors shall
have power and authority to make such rules and regulations as it may deem
necessary or proper concerning the issue, transfer and registration of
certificates for shares of stock of the Corporation.

Section 5.3 _Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates_. A new

the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or her legal representative, to
give the Corporation a bond, in such sum as the Board of Directors may direct,
in order to indemnify the Corporation against any claims that may be
made against it in connection therewith. A new certificate of stock may be
issued in the place of any certificate previously issued by the Corporation
that has become mutilated without the posting by the owner of any bond upon
the surrender by such owner of such mutilated certificate.

Section 5.4 _List of Stockholders Entitled To Vote_. The stock ledger shall be
the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list
required by General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware Section 219 or to
vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

 

Section 5.5 _Dividends_. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors may at any regular or special meeting,
declare dividends upon the stock of the Corporation either (a) out of its
surplus, as defined in and computed in accordance with General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware Section 154 or (b) in case there shall be no such
surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is
declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Before the declaration of any
dividend, the Board of Directors may set apart, out of any funds of the
Corporation available for dividends, such sum or sums as from time to time in
its discretion may be deemed proper for working capital or as a reserve fund
to meet contingencies or for such other purposes as shall be deemed conducive
to the interests of the Corporation.

Section 5.6 _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to
express consent to corporate action in writing or by electronic transmission
without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in
respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of
any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which
record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (a)
in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting
of stockholders or adjournment thereof shall, unless otherwise required by
law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date
of such meeting; (b) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not
be more than ten (10) days from the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (c) in the case of any
other action, shall not be more than  sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (i)
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting
is held; (ii) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no
prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first
date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken
or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with
law, or, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts
the resolution taking such prior action; and (iii) the record date for
determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

 

Section 5.7 _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to the surrender to the
Corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of stock
with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the Corporation
may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to
vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and
powers of an owner. Except as otherwise required by law, the Corporation shall
not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such
share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have
express or other notice thereof.

ARTICLE VI

 

INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE

 

Section 6.1 _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any proceeding by
reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee, partner (limited or general) or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee
benefit plan, shall be (and shall be deemed to have a contractual right to
be) indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation (and any successor to the
Corporation by merger or otherwise) to the fullest extent authorized by, and
subject to the conditions and (except as provided herein) procedures set
forth in the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but any
such amendment shall not be deemed to limit or prohibit the rights of
indemnification hereunder for past acts or omissions of any such person
insofar as such amendment limits or prohibits the indemnification rights that
said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment),
against all expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys fees,
judgments, fines, ERISA truces or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection
therewith; provided, however, that the Corporation shall indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person (except for a suit or action pursuant to
Section 6.2 hereof) only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Persons who are not directors
or officers of the Corporation and are not so serving at the request of the
Corporation may be similarly indemnified in respect of such service to the
extent authorized at any time by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The indemnification conferred in this Section 6.1 also shall include the right
to be paid by the Corporation (and such successor) the expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred in the defense of or other involvement in any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if
and to the extent the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to
repay all amounts so paid in advance if it shall ultimately be determined that
such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section
6.1 or otherwise; and provided further, that, such expenses incurred by other
employees and agents may be so paid in advance upon such terms and conditions,
if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

 

Section 6.2 _Right of Claimant to Bring Action Against the Corporation_. If a
claim under Section 6.1 is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty
days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant
may at any time thereafter bring an action against the Corporation to recover
the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the
claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such
action. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought
to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding in
advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is
required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met
the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the
Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed or is otherwise
not entitled to indemnification under Section 6.1, but the burden of proving
such defense shall be on the Corporation. The failure of the Corporation (in
the manner provided under the DGCL) to have made a determination prior to or
after the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is
proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in the DGCL shall not be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. Unless otherwise specified in an agreement with the claimant, an
actual determination by the Corporation (in the manner provided under the
DGCL) after the commencement of such action that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct shall not be a defense to the action, but
shall create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable
standard of conduct.

 

Section 6.3 _Non-exclusivity_. The rights to indemnification and advance
payment of expenses provided by Section 6.1 hereof shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and
advance payment of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.

 

Section 6.4 _Survival of Indemnification_. The indemnification and advance
payment of expenses and rights thereto provided by, or granted pursuant to,
Section 6.1 hereof shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee, partner or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the personal
representatives, heirs, executors and administrators of such person. Section 6.5 _Insurance_. The Corporation shall have power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, partner (limited or general)
or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted
against such person or incurred by such person in any such capacity, or
arising out of such persons status as such, and related expenses, whether or
not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the provisions of the DGCL.

 

Section 6.6 _Reliance on Provisions_. Each person who shall act as a director
or officer of the Corporation, or as the legal representative of such person,
or who while a director or officer serves at the request of the Corporation as
a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall be deemed to be doing so in reliance upon rights of
indemnification provided by this Article VI. Any repeal or modification of the
provisions of this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right or benefit
of any potential claimant existing at the time of such repeal or
modification.

ARTICLE VII

stockholder or director, or waiver by electronic transmission by such person,
whether given before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be
given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to be given to such
person. Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting need be specified
in such a waiver. Attendance at any meeting shall constitute waiver of notice
except attendance for the sole purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Section 7.6 _Section Headings_. Section headings in these Bylaws are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect

be given any effect to the extent of such inconsistency but shall otherwise be

Corporation Law of the State of Delaware referred to above are modified or
superseded, the references to those provisions is to be interpreted to refer
to the provisions as so modified or superseded.
