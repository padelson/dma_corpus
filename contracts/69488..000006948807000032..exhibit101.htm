</B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Effect on Capital Shares</U>.  At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, MergerCo or the Company or the holder of any capital shares of Parent, MergerCo or the Company:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Cancellation of Certain Common Shares</U>.  Each Common Share that is owned by the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Conversion of Common Shares</U>.  Each Common Share (each, a "<U>Share</U>" and collectively, the "<U>Shares</U>") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(a) and (ii) Dissenting Shares (each, an "<U>Excluded Share</U>" and collectively, the "<U>Excluded Shares</U>")) will be converted into the right to receive $22.50 in cash, without interest (the "<U>Merger Consideration</U>").</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Cancellation of Shares</U>.  At the Effective Time, all Shares will no longer be outstanding and all Shares will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and, subject to Section 3.3, each holder of a certificate formerly representing any such Shares (each, a "<U>Certificate</U>") will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, in accordance with Section 3.2.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Conversion of MergerCo Capital Shares</U>.  Each common share, without par value, of MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one common share, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Surrender of Certificates</U>  (a)  <U>Paying Agent</U>.  Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) MergerCo will designate, or cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "<U>Paying Agent</U>") to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates upon surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Article III from time to time after the Effective Time.  Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b) upon surrender of such Certificates (such cash being herein referred to as the "<U>Payment Fund</U>").  The Paying Agent will invest the Payment Fund as directed by the Surviving Corporation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payment Procedures</U>.  As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed by the parties specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration.  Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent (or, if such Shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such Shares to the Paying Agent on a book-entry account statement (it being understood that any references herein to Certificates shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares)), the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III, and the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.  No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Withholding Taxes</U>.  The Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Stock Options any amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payments under the Code and the rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law.  Any amounts so deducted and withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or holders of Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Further Transfers</U>.  After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination of Payment Fund</U>.  Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates six months after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, on demand, and any holder of a Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this Article III will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of his or her claims for Merger Consideration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, MergerCo, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person will be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</U>.  In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as the Surviving Corporation may determine are necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the OGCL, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any shareholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands the appraisal for such shares (the "<U>Dissenting Shares</U>") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.  Any such shareholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair cash value of such shareholder's Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that all Dissenting Shares held by any shareholder who shall have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn, in accordance with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, or lost such shareholder's rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares in the manner provided in this Article III or, if a portion of the Payment Fund deposited with the Paying Agent to pay for shares that become Dissenting Shares has been delivered to the Surviving Corporation in accordance with this Article III, upon demand to the Surviving Corporation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the OGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the OGCL.  The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Adjustments to Prevent Dilution</U>.  In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; <U>provided</U>, that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited or not expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Treatment of Options and Other Equity Awards</U>.  (a)  Each option to purchase Shares (collectively, the "<U>Stock Options</U>") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans will at the Effective Time be cancelled and the holder of such Stock Option will, in full settlement of such Stock Option and in exchange for the surrender to the Company of any certificate or other document evidencing such Stock Option, receive from the Company an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Stock Option multiplied by (y) the number of Shares subject to such Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment to each holder in respect of all Stock Options held rounded down to the nearest whole cent).  The holders of Stock Options will have no further rights in respect of any Stock Options from and after the Effective Time.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Shares that were granted as restricted stock shall be treated for purposes of this Article III as though all forfeiture restrictions have lapsed and such shares are fully issued and outstanding.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions and will take such other actions as shall be required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 3.5, without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation other than the payments provided in this Section 3.5.</P>

Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is in violation of its organizational or governing documents, except for such violations that would not, individually, or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.</P>

This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after shareholder approval hereof, so long as (a) no amendment that requires further shareholder approval under applicable Laws after shareholder approval hereof will be made without such required further approval and (b) such amendment has been duly authorized or approved by each of Parent and the Company.  This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties to this Agreement.</P>

</B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Interpretation</U>.  The headings in this Agreement are for reference only and do not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  Definitions will apply equally to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined.  Whenever the context may require, any pronoun will include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms.  All references in this Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter to Articles, Sections and Exhibits refer to Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits to, this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise.  The words "include," "includes" and "including" are not limiting and will be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation."  The phrases "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import will be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.  The word "or" will be inclusive and not exclusive unless the context requires otherwise.  Unless the context requires otherwise, any agreements, documents, instruments or Laws defined or referred to in this Agreement will be deemed to mean or refer to such agreements, documents, instruments or Laws as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (a) in the case of agreements, documents or instruments, by waiver or consent and (b) in the case of Laws, by succession of comparable successor statutes.  All references in this Agreement to any particular Law will be deemed to refer also to any rules and regulations promulgated under that Law.  References to a Person also refer to its predecessors and successors and permitted assigns.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Survival</U>.  None of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered under this Agreement will survive the Effective Time.  This Section 9.2 does not limit any covenant of the parties to this Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance after the Effective Time.  The Confidentiality Agreement will (a) survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms and (b) terminate as of the Effective Time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Governing Law</U>.  Except to the extent the laws of the State of Ohio are mandatorily applicable to the Merger, this Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any applicable principles of conflict of laws that would cause the Laws of another State to otherwise govern this Agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Submission to Jurisdiction</U>.  Each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York located in the borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or if such court does not have jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby.  Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and fully waives the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such suit, action or proceeding.  Each of the parties further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document to such party's respective address listed above in one of the manners set forth in Section 9.6 hereof shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process in any such suit, action or proceeding.  Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Person to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.  Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (a) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or (b) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Waiver of Jury Trial</U>.  Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Legal Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Each party to this Agreement certifies and acknowledges that (a) no Representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing waiver in the event of a Legal Action, (b) such party has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.5.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Entire Agreement</U>.  This Agreement (including the Exhibits to this Agreement), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Guarantees, and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.  No representation, warranty, inducement, promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been made or relied upon by any of the parties to this Agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Third-Party Beneficiaries</U>.  Except as provided in Section 6.8, this Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Severability</U>.  The provisions of this Agreement are severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision will be substituted for that provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and <BR>
(b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of that provision, or the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Rules of Construction</U>.  The parties to this Agreement have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and waive the application of any Laws or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in any agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or other document. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Assignment</U>.  This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise; <U>provided</U> that each of Parent and MergerCo may, without prior written consent of the Company, (a) assign any or all of its rights hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates, (b)&nbsp;designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder and (c)&nbsp;assign its rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement to any of its or its Affiliates' financing sources (in any or all of which cases each of Parent and MergerCo nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its obligations hereunder).  Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 9.11 will be null and void.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Remedies</U>.  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with the terms hereof and that Parent and MergerCo shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Time is of the Essence; Computation of Time</U>.  Time is of the essence for each and every provision of this Agreement.  Whenever the last day for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder shall fall upon a day that is not a Business Day, the party having such privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Counterparts; Effectiveness</U>.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which will be one and the same agreement.  This Agreement will become effective when each party to this Agreement will have received counterparts signed by all of the other parties.</P>
