iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 10, 2003 (this
"Agreement"), by and among Manpower Inc., a Wisconsin corporation
("Manpower"), Hoosier Acquisition Corp., a Pennsylvania corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Manpower ("Merger Sub"), and Right Management
Consultants, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company").



WHEREAS, the Special Committee (the "Special Committee") of the Companys
Board of Directors (the "Company Board") has recommended to the Company Board
that the Company Board should approve, and the Company Board, Manpowers Board
of Directors (the "Manpower Board") and Merger Subs Board of Directors have
approved, and have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective shareholders that Merger Sub make an exchange offer (the
"Offer") to exchange shares of Manpower Common Stock for shares of Company
Common Stock and have approved, and have deemed it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective shareholders to consummate, the merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the Business Corporation Law of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "PBCL"); and



WHEREAS, subsequent to the recommendation of this Agreement by the Special
Committee and the approval by the Company Board and concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement and as a condition and an inducement to the
willingness of Manpower and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, Manpower
has entered into a Tender and Voting Agreement with each shareholder listed
on Schedule I to such Tender and Voting Agreement (the "Tender and Voting
Agreement") pursuant to which each such shareholder has agreed to tender all
of the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such shareholder
in the Offer and to vote any shares of Company Common Stock not tendered in
the Offer in favor of the Merger; and



WHEREAS, it is intended that, for United States federal income tax purposes,
(i) the Offer and the Merger (together, the "Transaction") shall be treated
as an integrated transaction and shall qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and (ii) this Agreement shall constitute a plan
of reorganization within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under
Section 368(a) of the Code; and



 

1 WHEREAS, Manpower, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to
the transactions contemplated hereby; and



WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in Section 8.3 or
are elsewhere defined herein and referred to in Section 8.4;



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:



Article 1.



The Offer and the Merger



_Section 1.1 ___ _The Offer ___ __



_Section 1.1.1_ Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 7.1 hereof, Merger Sub shall, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (and shall use commercially reasonably
efforts to, within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof), commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer. Each
share of Company Common Stock accepted by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer
shall be exchanged for the right to receive that number of shares of Manpower
Common Stock equal to $18.75 divided by the Average Trading Price (rounded to
the fourth decimal place); provided, however, that if the number of shares so
calculated (1) is greater than 0.4497, then such number shall be reduced to
0.4497 (the "Fixed Exchange Rate"), or (2) is less than 0.3680, then such
number shall be increased to 0.3680; and provided, further, that if the
Average Trading Price is less than $37.80, then Manpower shall have the
option, but not the obligation, to issue an additional number of shares of
Manpower Common Stock (the "Additional Shares") for each share of Company
Common Stock such that the sum of (a) the product of the Fixed Exchange Rate
and the Average Trading Price and (b) the product of the Additional Shares and
the Average Trading Price shall equal $17.00 (such number of shares of
Manpower Common Stock, as adjusted if applicable, and the number of Additional
Shares are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Exchange Rate"). If,
prior to 12:00 noon New York time on the first trading 



 

2 day preceding the Appointment Time, Manpower has, by written notice to the
Company, elected to exercise its option to issue the Additional Shares, then
the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1.7. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth
Business Day following commencement of the Offer. The obligations of Merger
Sub to accept for exchange and exchange the number of shares of Manpower
Common Stock for shares of Company Common Stock shall be subject to the
condition (the "Minimum Condition") that there shall be validly tendered in
accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of shares of
Company Common Stock (including shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Tender and Voting Agreement) which, together with the shares
of Company Common Stock then owned by Manpower and Merger Sub (if any),
immediately prior to acceptance for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, represents at least a majority of the sum of (i) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to such acceptance, and (ii) a number of shares of Company Common Stock
determined by Manpower up to a maximum of the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all options,
warrants, rights and convertible securities outstanding on the date hereof
(such sum of shares is hereinafter referred to as the "Diluted Share Amount"),
and to the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto. Manpower and
Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive the conditions to the Offer
and to make any change in the terms or conditions of the Offer; provided,
however, that without the prior written consent of the Company, no change may
be made which (A) decreases the number of shares of Company Common Stock
sought in the Offer, (B) changes the form or amount of consideration to be
paid, (C) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in
Annex I, (D) changes or waives the Minimum Condition or any of the conditions
set forth in clauses (2), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of the first paragraph of Annex
I, provided, that if the Company delivers to Manpower the Companys written
consent to the waiver of clauses (5) and (6) of the first paragraph of Annex
I, then Manpower and Merger Sub shall be deemed to have waived clauses (5) and
(6) of the first paragraph of Annex I, (E) changes the expiration date of the
Offer (except as set forth in the following two sentences), or (F) makes any
other change to any of the terms and conditions to the Offer which is adverse
in any material respect to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction (or
waiver to the extent permitted by this Agreement) of



 

3 the conditions to the Offer, Merger Sub shall accept for exchange all shares
of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer as soon as practicable after the applicable expiration date of the Offer
(as it may be extended in accordance with the requirements of this Section
1.1.1) and shall exchange all such shares of Company Common Stock for shares
of Manpower Common Stock as provided herein promptly after acceptance;
provided, however, that (x) Merger Sub may extend the Offer for successive
extension periods not in excess of ten (10) Business Days per extension up to
the Outside Date if, at the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any
of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived, until
such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, and (y) Merger Sub may
extend the Offer if and to the extent required by the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC or NYSE. In addition, Merger Sub may extend the Offer
after the acceptance of shares of Company Common Stock thereunder for a
further period of time (not to exceed twenty (20) Business Days) by means of
a subsequent offering period under Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange
Act (the "Extended Offer") if, as of such date, shares of Company Common Stock
representing less than 80% of the Diluted Share Amount have been tendered. If
an Extended Offer is made, Merger Sub shall immediately accept for exchange
all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
to the Extended Offer as they are tendered and shall exchange all such shares
of Company Common Stock for shares of Manpower Common Stock as provided herein
promptly after acceptance. In this Agreement other than in this Article 1, the
term "Offer" shall include the Extended Offer. Manpower will announce
the Exchange Rate with respect to each share of Company Common Stock that is
to be exchanged in the Offer by 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the trading
day immediately preceding the Appointment Time. No fraction of a share of
Manpower Common Stock will be issued in connection with the exchange of
Manpower Common Stock for shares of Company Common Stock upon consummation of
the Offer, but in lieu thereof each tendering shareholder who would otherwise
be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Manpower Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Manpower Common Stock that otherwise
would be received by such Company Shareholder) in the Offer shall receive from
Manpower an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying such fraction by the
Average Trading Price.



 

4 _Section 1.1.2_ As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Manpower shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-4 to register the offer and sale of Manpower Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer (the "Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement will include
a preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule
14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the "Preliminary Prospectus"). As
soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Manpower and
Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer which will contain or incorporate by reference
all or part of the Preliminary Prospectus and form of the related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement, if any (together with any supplements
or amendments thereto, collectively the "Offer Documents"), and (ii) cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock. Manpower shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after the filing thereof with the SEC and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to complete the Offer.
As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
furnish to Manpower and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company, the
Companys Subsidiaries and the Companys Shareholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
Section 1.1.2. Manpower, Merger Sub and the Company each agree promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Registration Statement
or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect. Manpower and Merger Sub
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company and its legal advisors shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO, the
Registration Statement and the Offer Documents prior to their being filed
with the SEC or disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
Manpower agrees to provide the Company and its legal advisors with any
comments Manpower, Merger Sub or their legal advisors may receive in writing
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents as soon as
practicable after receipt of such written comments.



 

5 _Section 1.2 _ _Company Action_ __



_Section 1.2.1_ As soon as practicable on the day that the Offer
is commenced, the Company will file with the SEC and disseminate to holders
of shares of Company Common Stock a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9") which shall include the written opinions
of UBS Securities LLC ("UBS") and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("J.P. Morgan")
referred to in Section 3.15.2 hereof and, subject to Section 5.7 hereof, shall
include the Recommendations. As soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, Manpower shall furnish to the Company all information
concerning Manpower, Manpowers Subsidiaries and Manpowers shareholders that
may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this Section 1.2.1. Subject to Section 5.7 hereof, the
Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Recommendations in the Offer
Documents and agrees that none of the Recommendations shall be withdrawn,
modified or changed in a manner adverse to Manpower or Merger Sub, and no
resolution by the Company Board, the Special Committee or any other committee
of the Company Board to withdraw, modify or change any of the Recommendations
in a manner adverse to Manpower or Merger Sub shall be adopted or proposed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Appointment Time, the Company
Board or the Special Committee may withhold, withdraw, modify or change in a
manner adverse to Manpower, or fail to make, the Recommendations solely in
accordance with the terms of Section 5.7 hereof. The Company, Manpower and
Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company agrees
to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. Manpower and its legal advisors shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to
its being filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock. The Company agrees to provide Manpower and its legal
advisors with any comments the Company or its legal advisors receives in
writing from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 as soon
as practicable after receipt of such written comments.



 

6 _Section 1.2.2_ The Company will promptly furnish Manpower and Merger
Sub with a list of its shareholders, mailing labels and any available
listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of all record
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of securities positions of
shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in each case as of
the most recent practicable date, and will provide to Manpower and Merger Sub
such additional information (including, without limitation, updated lists of
shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Manpower or Merger Sub may reasonably request in
connection with the Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, Manpower and Merger Sub
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon
request, deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their
possession.



_Section 1.3 _ _Directors_ __



 

 _Section 1.3.1_ Effective upon the first acceptance for exchange by
Merger Sub of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the
"Appointment Time"), Manpower shall be entitled to designate the number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board that
equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this
Section 1.3) and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Manpower or Merger Sub (including shares of Company
Common Stock accepted for payment) bears to the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding, and the Company shall take all action
reasonably necessary to cause Manpowers designees to be elected or appointed
to the Company Board, including, without limitation, at the option of
Manpower, increasing the number of directors, or seeking and accepting
resignations of incumbent directors, or both; provided, however, that prior to
the Effective Time, the Company Board shall always have at least two members
who were directors of the Company prior to consummation of the Offer (each, a
"Continuing Director"). If the number of Continuing Directors is reduced to
fewer than two for any reason prior to the Effective Time, the remaining and
departing Continuing Directors shall be entitled to designate a person to fill
the vacancy who shall be deemed to be a



 

7 Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Continuing
Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate two persons to
fill such vacancies who shall not be officers or affiliates of Manpower or any
of its subsidiaries, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if Manpowers designees are elected to the
Company Board prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority
of the Continuing Directors shall be required for the Company to (a) amend or
terminate this Agreement or agree or consent to any amendment or termination
of this Agreement, (b) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company or Company
Shareholders or any of its or their rights, benefits or remedies hereunder,
(c) extend the time for performance of Manpowers and Merger Subs respective
obligations hereunder, or (d) approve any other action by the Company which is
reasonably likely to adversely affect the interests of the Company
Shareholders (other than Manpower, Merger Sub and their affiliates (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries)) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



_Section 1.3.2_ The Companys obligations to appoint designees of
Manpower to its Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly
take all actions required pursuant to this Section 1.3 and Rule 14f-l
in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3 and shall include
in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its
officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l.
Manpower will supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for
any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors
and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.



_Section 1.4_ _The Merger_. Upon the terms (including, without
limitation, Section 5.4 hereof) and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the PBCL,
Merger Sub, at the Effective Time, shall be merged with and into the Company
(the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").



_Section 1.5_ _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article 6, the parties hereto shall cause the



 

8 Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "Articles of
Merger") with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of, the PBCL (the date and time of such filing, or if
another date and time is specified in such filing, such specified date and
time, being the "Effective Time").



_Section 1.6_ _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect

9 Article 2.



 

Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates



_Section 2.1_ _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or the record holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company
Shareholders"):



_Section 2.1.1_ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1.2), shall be converted,
subject to Section 2.1.4, into the right to receive that number of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except as provided by
Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, including
predecessor statutes and judicial interpretations thereof) shares of Manpower
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Rate. All such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing
any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration. Certificates previously representing shares of Company
Common Stock shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration without interest,
upon surrender of such certificates in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.2. The term "Merger Consideration" means, for a share or number of
shares of Company Common Stock held by a Company Shareholder, the number of
Manpower Shares determined as described in the first sentence of this
subsection and as provided in Section 2.1.4, plus any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Manpower Common Stock as provided in Section 2.1.4,
in respect of such share or shares. The term "Manpower Shares" means the
shares of Manpower Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration.



_Section 2.1.2_ Each share of Company Common Stock held by Manpower,
Merger Sub, any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Manpower or Merger Sub, in the
treasury of the Company or by any wholly-owned Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.



_Section 2.1.3_ Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted



 

10 into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.



_Section 2.1.4_ No fractional shares of Manpower Common Stock shall be
issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Manpower Common Stock that a
Company Shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the
Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such
aggregation, such Company Shareholder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu
thereof, an amount in cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) without
interest determined by multiplying the Average Trading Price by the fraction
of a share of Manpower Common Stock to which such Company Shareholder would
otherwise have been entitled.



_Section 2.2 _ _Exchange of Certificates_. __



_Section 2.2.1_ Prior to the Effective Time, Manpower shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with Mellon Investor Services or another bank or
trust company designated by Manpower (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit
of the Company Shareholders, for exchange in accordance with this Article 2
through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the Manpower Shares.
Manpower agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as
needed and promptly following a request therefor from the Exchange Agent, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.1.4. Any cash and certificates of Manpower Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the
Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1 out of
the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
Manpower will pay all fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent. 



_Section 2.2.2_ Promptly after the Effective Time, Manpower and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Common Stock (each a "Certificate"), a form letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Manpower and the Company may



 

11 reasonably specify) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.



_Section 2.2.3_ Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or
Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed by the
holder of record thereof, the holder of record of such Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration that such Company Shareholder has the right to receive under
this Article 2, and such Certificate or Certificates shall forthwith be
canceled. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than
the Company Shareholder in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of exchange that such surrendered
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the exchange by a Person other
than the holder of record of the Certificate surrendered or such Person shall
establish to the satisfaction of Manpower that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall represent, for all purposes, the right
only to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration in respect of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by such Certificate.



_Section 2.2.4_ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the Company Shareholders for six months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Manpower upon demand, and any Company Shareholders
who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look
only to Manpower to claim the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. 



_Section 2.2.5_ No dividends or other distributions that are declared on
or after the Effective Time on Manpower Common Stock or are payable to the
holders of record thereof on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the
Company Shareholders entitled by reason of the Merger to receive certificates
representing Manpower Common Stock until such Company Shareholders surrender
their Certificates, as provided in this Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of
applicable Law, there shall be paid to the holder of record of
the certificates representing such Manpower Common Stock (or, if applicable
under Section 2.2.3, the other Person) (a) at the time of such surrender or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of



 

12 any dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to whole
shares of such Manpower Common Stock having a record date on or after the
Effective Time and a payment date prior to such surrender and (b) at the
appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount
of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole shares of
Manpower Common Stock having a record date on or after the Effective Time but
prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender. In no event
shall the Company Shareholder or other Person entitled to receive such
dividends or other distributions be entitled to receive interest on such
dividends or other distributions.



_Section 2.2.6_ Neither Manpower nor the Company shall be liable to any
Company Shareholder for any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



_Section 2.2.7_ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Manpower,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such amount as Manpower may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Exchange
Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration which the holder thereof would have been entitled to receive in
respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant to Section
2.2.3, without any interest thereon, together with any amounts then payable
pursuant to Section 2.2.5.



_Section 2.2.8_ All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock (other than the
rights, if any, under Section 2.2.5).



_Section 2.3_ _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter, there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or
by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or



 

13 Manpower for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article 2.

 



_Section 2.4_ _Stock Options_.



_Section 2.4.1_ At the Effective Time, Manpower will assume the option
plans listed in Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Company
Option Plans") and all of the Companys obligations thereunder. At the
Effective Time, each outstanding option issued pursuant to the Company Option
Plans (each, a "Company Option") shall be deemed to constitute a fully vested
and immediately exercisable option to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Company Option (including, without
limitation, the time periods allowed for exercise), a number of shares of
Manpower Common Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Rate and the number
of shares subject to such Company Option, provided that any fractional shares
of Manpower Common Stock resulting from such calculation shall be rounded to
the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Manpower Common
Stock equal to the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option divided by the number of shares
of Manpower Common Stock subject to such assumed Company Option.



_Section 2.4.2_ Manpower shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Manpower Common Stock
for delivery upon exercise of the Company Options adjusted in accordance with
this Section 2.4. Manpower shall file one or more registration statements on
Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form, not later than
5:30 p.m. New York time on the Closing Date, with respect to the Manpower
Common Stock subject to such Company Options, shall cause such registration
statement or registration statements to become effective as promptly as
practicable after filing, and shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the related prospectus or prospectuses) for so long as such Company
Options remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if any, who
subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, Manpower shall administer the Company
Option Plans assumed pursuant to this Section 2.4 in a manner that complies
with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the Company
Option Plans complied with such rule prior to the Merger.



 

14 _Section 2.4.3_ As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in
no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, Manpower shall deliver
to the holders of Company Options appropriate notices setting forth, among
other things, the number of shares of Manpower Common Stock subject to options
held by such holders pursuant to the operation of this Section 2.4 and the
rights of such holders with respect to such options.



_Section 2.5_ _Adjustments to Exchange Rate_. If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Manpower
Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, the Exchange Rate and any other calculation based on or
relating to the Manpower Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, as the case
may be, shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares such that there shall be the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement if such event had not occurred.



_Section 2.6_ _Withholding Rights_. Manpower or the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable or
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Shareholder or other
Person such amounts as Manpower or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law with respect to the making of
such payment, and shall pay all amounts so deducted and withheld for the
account of, or for the benefit of, the applicable holder on or prior to the
date such amounts are required to be paid to the applicable Tax authority or
Governmental Entity. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Manpower or
the Exchange Agent, and paid as aforesaid, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company
Shareholder or other Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.



_Section 2.7_ _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (A) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties, Permits,
licenses or assets of



 

15 either of the Company or Merger Sub, or (B) otherwise to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers
and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds,
bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such other acts and things as
may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the
Surviving Corporations rights, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties, Permits or assets of
the Company or Merger Sub, as the case may be, and otherwise to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.



_Section 2.8_ _Closing_. Unless the transactions herein contemplated have
been abandoned and this Agreement terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Pepper Hamilton LLP, 3000 Two Logan Square, 18th and Arch Streets, Philadelphia,
PA 19103 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the second Business Day after all of
the closing conditions set forth Article 6 have been satisfied or waived
(except for those conditions that, by the express terms thereof, are not
capable of being satisfied until the Effective Time, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions)(in any event, the
"Closing Date"), unless otherwise provided by the mutual agreement, in
writing, of Manpower, Merger Sub and the Company. Scheduling or commencing the
Closing shall not constitute a waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6
by either Manpower, Merger Sub or the Company.

16 not received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or
modification of any Company Approvals, except where the failure to have such

or modifications would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property and
assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed which would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered a complete, true and correct copy of the Company
Organizational Documents, as amended to date, to Manpower. The Company
Organizational Documents are in full force and effect. The Company is not in
violation of any of the provisions of the Company Organizational Documents.
The minute books of the Company contain true and accurate minutes or consents

PBCL applies) and the filing and recordation of the Articles of Merger
in accordance with the PBCL, have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of

recommended this Agreement to the Board, and the Company Board has unanimously
approved this Agreement and has resolved to recommend that the Company
Shareholders accept the Offer and vote their shares of Company Common Stock

hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the

obligation of Manpower and Merger Sub,



 

17 constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.



_Section 3.3_ _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby will not require any

the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.3(a)-(d),
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
Law binding upon or applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by
which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or affected, (c)
constitute a breach of or default under (or an event that with notice or lapse
of time or both could reasonably be expected to become such a breach or
default) or give rise (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) to a
right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration under any
agreement, contract, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license,
concession, franchise, Permit or other similar authorization or joint venture,
limited liability or partnership agreement or other instrument or obligation
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the

all powers and authority and is in possession of all franchises, grants,
Permits, and orders ("Company Subsidiary Approvals") required to own, lease or
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, and no Company Subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings
relating to the revocation or modification of any Company Subsidiary
Approvals, except where the failure to have such power and authority or

modifications would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or entity to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property
and assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities

state and foreign securities Laws, and (ii) except as set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, are owned by the Company or another Company
Subsidiary free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges,

character, including without limitation, voting agreements or arrangements,
relating to the issued or unissued Equity Interests of any Company Subsidiary
or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any
Equity Interests of, or other Equity Interests in, any Company Subsidiary.

Company Subsidiary or any other entity, except for loan commitments and other
funding obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business.



_Section 3.6.3_ The Company has made available to Manpower complete, true and
correct copies of the Organizational Documents, as amended to date, of each
Company Subsidiary. The Organizational Documents of each Company Subsidiary
are in full force and effect. No Company Subsidiary is in violation of any of

case may be.



_Section 3.7.3_ No Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act
contained, as of its filing date, any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. No Company SEC Document, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act contained, as of the date on
which the document or amendment became effective, any untrue statement of a

Effect, (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred after September 30, 2003 in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that would not
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect; and (iv) liabilities or obligations that arise under
this Agreement.



_Section 3.9_ _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, since September 30, 2003, except as otherwise

_Section 3.12_ _Employee Benefits._ __



_Section 3.12.1_ The Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete
list of each "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA, including, without limitation, multiemployer plans within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of



 

25 ERISA), and all stock purchase, stock option, restricted stock, severance,
employment, retiree medical, life insurance, supplemental retirement, change-
in-control, termination, fringe benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, employee loan and all other employee benefit plans, agreements,
contracts, programs, policies or other arrangements, whether or not subject
to ERISA (including any funding mechanism therefor now in effect or required
in the future as a result of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise), whether oral or written, (i) which are contributed to, sponsored
by or maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (ii) under
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any present or future
liability (each such plan, agreement, contract, program, policy and
arrangement, a "Company Plan"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to list on the Company Disclosure Schedule any Company
Plan that is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States or that
covers any employee residing or working outside of the United States (a
"Foreign Benefit Plan") unless that plan (x) benefits primarily senior
executive employees or former senior executive employees (excluding any
individual agreement), (y) is a defined benefit type pension plan, or
(z) provides medical benefits following termination of employment other than
in accordance with applicable Law (a "Material Foreign Benefit Plan").



_Section 3.12.2_ With respect to each Company Plan, other than a Foreign
Benefit Plan that is not a Material Foreign Benefit Plan, the Company
has provided to Manpower a current, accurate and complete copy (or a
description if such Company Plan is not in writing) thereof and, to the extent
applicable: (i) any related trust agreement or other funding instrument; (ii)
the most recently issued IRS determination letter and the materials submitted
to obtain that letter, if applicable (and, if materials have been submitted to
obtain a GUST determination letter but that letter has not been issued prior
to the date hereof, the materials submitted to obtain the GUST determination
letter); (iii) any summary plan description and summary of material
modifications; (iv) the Form 5500 and attached schedules, if applicable, for
the three latest completed plan years; and (v) the actuarial and financial
statements for the three latest completed plan years, if required to be
prepared under applicable Law.



_Section 3.12.3_ Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
member of the Companys "controlled group," within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(14) of ERISA, maintains or contributes to, or within the five years
preceding the Effective Time has maintained or contributed to, an employee
pension benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA



 

26 ("Title IV Plan"). No Title IV Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan" as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. Except as disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company Plans obligates the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries to pay separation, severance, termination or similar-
type benefits solely as a result of any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement that would be a "parachute payment" within the meaning of such term
under Section 280G of the Code. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, or as required by COBRA or other applicable Law, none of the
Company Plans provides for or promises medical, disability or life insurance
benefits to any retired employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.



_Section 3.12.4_ Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, each
Company Plan has been operated in all respects in accordance with its terms
and the requirements of all applicable Laws, except where such violations of
applicable Law would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No legal action, suit or claim
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any
Company Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and,
except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of
the Company, no fact or event exists that could give rise to any such action,
suit or claim. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any material liability
under Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code that has not been
satisfied in full and no condition exists that presents a material risk of
incurring any such liability.



_Section 3.12.5_ Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code (including each
trust established in connection with such a Company Plan that is intended to
be exempt from Federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code) has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that it is so
qualified, and, except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company is not aware of any fact or event that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Plan. Except as
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, no trust maintained or
contributed to by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is intended
to be qualified as a voluntary employees beneficiary association or is
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(9) of
the Code.



 

27 _Section 3.12.6_ Except for matters disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has not incurred
any material liability for any civil penalties arising under Section 502 of
ERISA or for any excise tax arising under Sections 4971 through 4980F of the
Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, no
fact or event exists that could give rise to any such liability.



_Section 3.12.7_ In all material respects, all contributions, premiums or
payments required to be made with respect to any Company Plan have been made
on or before their due dates.



_Section 3.12.8_ Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
relating to, or any change in employee participation or coverage under, any
Company Plan that would increase in any material respect the expense of
maintaining such Company Plan above the level of the expense incurred in
respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to the date
hereof.



_Section 3.12.9_ Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i)
all Foreign Benefit Plans have been established, maintained and administered
in compliance in all material respects with their terms and all applicable
Laws; (ii) all Foreign Benefit Plans that are required to be funded are fully
funded, and with respect to all other Foreign Benefit Plans, adequate
reserves therefore have been established on the accounting statements of the
applicable Company or Company Subsidiary; and (iii) no material liability or
obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary exists with respect to
such Foreign Benefit Plans, which are not Material Foreign Benefit Plans, that
has not been disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule.



_Section 3.12.10_ Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company has not established any trust for funding any Company Plan (not
including any Foreign Benefit Plan). The Company has fully funded to an
account maintained in the Companys name all employee contributions and any
required or discretionary matching employer contributions required under the
Companys Deferred Compensation Plan for Select Employees, as amended May 2,
2002.



_Section 3.12.11_ The Company Options have been authorized, approved and
granted in accordance with the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation 



 

28 1.162-27(e)(2)(vi) such that any amount of any compensation deduction to the
Company resulting from the exercise of any Company Option will not be limited
by Code Section 162.



_Section 3.13 _ _Compliance with Laws; Licenses, Permits and
Registrations._ __



_Section 3.13.1_ Other than Environmental Laws, which are covered in Section
3.21, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict with, or
in default or violation of, or has violated, (i) any Laws applicable to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which its or any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, or (ii) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, Permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties or assets is bound or affected, except for such
conflicts, defaults or violations which would not be reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



_Section 3.13.2_ Other than environmental Permits, which are covered in
Section 3.21, the Company and each Company Subsidiary have all Permits
under all Laws and from all Governmental Entities necessary to carry on their
respective businesses as currently conducted, except where the failure to have
any Permit would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



_Section 3.13.3_ The Company, and, to the knowledge of the Company, each of
its officers and directors are in compliance with, and have complied in all
material respects with (A) the applicable provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and (B)
the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NYSE. With respect to each Annual Report on Form 10-K, each Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report filed by the Company with
the SEC since August 29, 2002, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company have made all certifications required by
Sarbanes-Oxley, and the statements contained in each such certification were
complete and correct when made.



_Section 3.14 _ _Intellectual Property_. Except as would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company and each Company Subsidiary own or have a valid license or
other right to use each trademark, service mark, trade name, domain name,
invention, patent, trade secret, copyright, know-how (including any
registrations or applications for



 

29 registration of any of the foregoing) or any other similar type of proprietary
intellectual property right used in the business of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary, as currently conducted (collectively, the "Company
Intellectual Property"). Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any
written notice of infringement of or challenge to, and there are no Claims
pending, or to the knowledge of the Company threatened, with respect to the
rights of others to the use of, any Company Intellectual Property that if
determined adversely to the Company would be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



_Section 3.15 _ _Transaction Fees; Opinions of Financial Advisors._ __



_Section 3.15.1_ Except for UBS and J. P. Morgan, whose fees and expenses
will be borne by the Company, there is no investment banker, financial
advisor, broker, finder or other intermediary which has been retained by, or
is authorized to act on behalf of, the Company, the Special Committee or any
Company Subsidiary which is entitled to any fee or commission from the
Company, the Special Committee, any Company Subsidiary, Manpower or any of
their respective affiliates upon consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has heretofore
furnished to Manpower complete and correct copies of all agreements, as
amended through the date hereof, between the Company, a Company Subsidiary or
the Special Committee, on the one hand, and UBS or J.P. Morgan, on the other

this Agreement.



_Section 3.15.2_ The Company Board and the Special Committee have received the
written opinions of UBS and J.P. Morgan, each dated as of the date hereof, to
the effect that, as of such date, and subject to the qualifications stated

to the Offer and the Merger is fair to the Company Shareholders from a
financial point of view. The Company will promptly, after the date of this
Agreement, deliver a copy of such written opinions to Manpower.

all material respects with all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment,

30 compensation, occupational safety, plant closings, wages and hours, and any
other Law applicable to any current or former employee or director of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (each a "Company Employee"), or the
independent contractors and consultants of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Independent Contractors"), or other
Persons providing services to the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
including, without limitation, all Laws concerning the classification of

_Section 3.18.1_ Except to the extent that Section 1924(b)(1)(ii) of
Subchapter C of Chapter 19 of the PBCL applies, the only vote required of
the holders of any class or series of the Companys Equity Interests
necessary to adopt this Agreement and to approve the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby is the approval of a majority of the votes
cast by the Company Shareholders (the "Company Shareholder Approval") at the
meeting of Company Shareholders to be held to consider the approval and
adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Shareholders Meeting").



_Section 3.18.2_ The Company has duly and validly taken all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company to render inapplicable
to the Company the provisions of Subchapters E, G, H, I and J of Chapter 25 of

share acquisition," "fair price" or other anti-takeover laws or regulations
enacted under federal Laws in the United States or under similar provisions in

_Section 3.18.3_ The Special Committee at a meeting duly called and held on

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, the Offer and the Merger, are in



 

34 the best interests of the Company and has recommended to the Company Board
that it approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation, the Offer and the Merger, and the

approval by the Company Board represent all action necessary to (A) render
inapplicable the provisions of Section 2538(a) of Subchapter D of Chapter 25
of the PBCL with respect to, and (B) make it permissible for the Company to
effect, without further corporate action under the provisions of Subchapter F

Subsidiary, nor any of the Companys affiliates has taken or agreed to take
any action that would prevent the Transaction from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. To the
Companys knowledge, there are no agreements, plans or other circumstances
that would prevent the Transaction from qualifying as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has
good and marketable title to all of their respective properties and assets,

all other Liens except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, pledges to
secure deposits and such minor imperfections of title, if any, as do not
materially detract from the value of or interfere with the present use of the
property affected thereby or which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; and all
leases pursuant to which the Company or any of the Company



 

35 Subsidiaries lease from others material amounts of real or personal property
are in good standing, valid and effective in accordance with their respective
terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any existing material
default or event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a material default and in respect of which the Company
or such Company Subsidiary has not taken adequate steps to prevent such a
default from occurring). Substantially all of the Companys and each of the
Company Subsidiaries buildings and equipment in regular use have
been reasonably maintained and are in good and serviceable condition,
reasonable wear and tear excepted.

written notice, notification, demand, request for information, citation,
summons, complaint or administrative or judicial order has been received by,

to the knowledge of the Company threatened, by any Person against, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, with respect to any applicable Environmental Laws
and (ii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are and have been in

incorporated, validly existing and in active status under the Laws of the
State of Wisconsin, and Merger Sub is duly incorporated, validly subsisting

possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, Permits,
easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("Manpower Approvals")
required to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted, and neither Manpower nor Merger Sub has
received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification
of any Manpower Approvals, except in each case where the revocations or
modifications, or the failure to have such power and authority and to possess
the Manpower Approvals would not be



 

38 reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Manpower
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Manpower and Merger Sub is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of the property and assets owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed
which would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Manpower Material Adverse Effect. The Manpower Organizational
Documents and the Merger Sub Organizational Documents are in full force and
effect. Manpower is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Manpower
Organizational Documents and Merger Sub is not in violation of any of the
provisions of the Merger Sub Organizational Documents.



_Section 4.2_ _Corporate Authorization_. The execution, delivery and

Merger in accordance with the PBCL, have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of Manpower and Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to

and Merger Sub, and assuming that this Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the Company, constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Manpower and Merger Sub, enforceable against Manpower and Merger
Sub in accordance with its terms.



_Section 4.3_ _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Manpower and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation
by Manpower and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby will not

consents, approvals, actions, orders, authorizations, Permits, registrations,
declarations and filings which, if not obtained or made, would not prevent or
delay consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent Manpower or Merger Sub
from performing its obligations under this Agreement, and would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Manpower
Material Adverse Effect.

performance by Manpower and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation
by Manpower and Merger Sub of the Offer and the Merger and the other

without notice or lapse of time or both) to a right of termination, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration under any agreement, contract, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, concession, franchise, Permit or other
similar authorization or joint venture, limited liability or partnership
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Manpower or any Manpower
Subsidiary is a party or by which Manpower, any Manpower Subsidiary or any of
their respective properties or assets is bound or affected, or (d) result in
the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the properties or assets of
Manpower or any Manpower Subsidiary, other than, in the case of clauses (b),

Manpower Subsidiary Approvals, except in each case where the revocations or

conditions precedent set forth in Annex I hereto; or



 

50 _Section 5.1.14_ authorize, agree or commit, verbally or in writing, to do any
of the foregoing.



_Section 5.2_ _Conduct of Business of Manpower_. Except as set forth in the
Manpower Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise expressly contemplated hereby,
from the date hereof until the Appointment Time, Manpower shall, and shall
cause each Manpower Subsidiary to, conduct its business in all material

foregoing, except as set forth in the Manpower Disclosure Schedule or as
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, from the date hereof until
the Appointment Time, Manpower shall not, nor shall it permit any Manpower
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to:



_Section 5.2.1 _ (a) amend the Manpower Organizational Documents or the
Organizational Documents of any Manpower Subsidiary except for such amendments
that would not prevent or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) split, combine or reclassify
the Manpower Common Stock without adjusting the Exchange Rate appropriately;
or (c) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution (whether
in cash, stock or property or any combination thereof) in respect of the

Common Stock (other than the declaration and payment of regular semi-annual

_Section 5.2.2_ adopt a plan of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution,
merger, consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization
of Manpower or the Merger Sub (other than the Offer and the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby);



 

51 _Section 5.2.3_ willfully take any action that would result in (a) a material
breach of any provision of this Agreement or (b) the failure to satisfy the
conditions precedent set forth in Annex I hereto (except for any waiver
permitted to be made hereby or in Annex I); or



_Section 5.2.4_ authorize, agree or commit, verbally or in writing, to do any
of the foregoing.



_Section 5.3 _ _Cooperation_. The Company and Manpower shall coordinate and
cooperate in connection with (A) the preparation of the Offer Documents, the
Schedule 14D-9, the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement, the Post-
Effective Amendment and any other filings, (B) determining whether any action
by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, or
any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from
parties to any Material Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
Offer and the Merger, and (C) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers or making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith or with the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, the

approvals or waivers.



_Section 5.4_ _Shareholder Approval; Preparation of Registration Statement
and Proxy Statement/Prospectus_.



_Section 5.4.1_ If approval of the Company Shareholders is required by
applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, Manpower and the Company
shall, as soon as practicable following the Appointment Time, prepare and the
Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and Manpower and the
Company shall prepare and Manpower shall file with the SEC a post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement (the "Post-Effective Amendment") for
the offer and sale of Manpower Shares pursuant to the Merger and in which the
Proxy Statement will be included. Each of the Company and Manpower shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to have the Post-Effective Amendment declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Shareholders as promptly as
practicable after the Post-Effective Amendment is declared effective under
the Securities Act. Manpower shall also take any action (other than qualifying
to do  



 

52  business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a
general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of Manpower
Shares in the Merger and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of capital stock of the Company as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the
Post-Effective Amendment will be made by Manpower, or with respect to the
Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, without providing the other party
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Manpower will advise
the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Post-Effective Amendment has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Manpower Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for the amendment of the Post-Effective Amendment or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. The
Company will advise Manpower, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
any request by the SEC for the amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Manpower, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Manpower which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either of the Post-
Effective Amendment or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the shareholders of the Company.



_Section 5.4.2_ If approval of the Company Shareholders is required by
applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall establish,
prior to or as soon as practicable following the date upon which the Post-
Effective Amendment becomes effective, a record date (which shall be prior to
or as soon as practicable following the date upon  



 

53  which the Post-Effective Amendment becomes effective) for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose
of considering the approval and adoption of this Agreement and (with the
consent of Manpower) such other matters as may in the reasonable judgment of
the Company be appropriate for consideration at the Company Shareholders
Meeting. Once the Company Shareholders Meeting has been called and noticed,
the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting
(other than for the absence of a quorum) without the consent of Manpower. The
Post-Effective Amendment and the Proxy Statement shall include the opinions
of UBS and J.P. Morgan referred to in Section 3.15.2 hereof and, subject to
the Companys right, pursuant to Section 5.7 hereof, to withhold, withdraw,
modify, change or fail to make the Recommendations, the Company Board and the
Special Committee shall include the Recommendations in the Post-Effective
Amendment and the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of shareholders required by the PBCL to effect the Merger,
unless the Company Board and the Special Committee shall have withheld,
withdrawn, modified, changed or failed to make their Recommendations in
compliance with Section 5.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Companys obligation to establish a record
date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders
Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.4.2 shall not be limited by or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
of any Acquisition Proposal. Manpower shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of
the shares of Company Common Stock acquired in the Offer or otherwise then
owned by it or any Manpower Subsidiary in favor of the approval of this
Agreement.



_Section 5.4.3_ Notwithstanding Sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 above, if Merger Sub
shall own, by virtue of the Offer, at least 80% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take all necessary actions
(including actions referred to in Section 5.4.1 above, as applicable) to cause
the Merger to become effective, as soon as practicable after the expiration
of the Offer, without a meeting of or approval by the Company Shareholders, in
accordance with Section 1924(b)(1)(ii) of Subchapter C of Chapter 19 of the
PBCL.



_Section 5.5_ _Reserved_.



  

54 _Section 5.6_ _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.



_Section 5.6.1_ Except as required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement
or similar agreement or arrangement to which the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, Manpower or any Manpower Subsidiary is a party (which such Person
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the counterparty to
waive), from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each party
shall, and shall cause each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal advisors, investment bankers,
financial advisors, agents and other representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") to (A) provide to the other party and its Representatives
access at reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees,
agents, properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its
subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof and (B) furnish promptly
such information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets,
liabilities, personnel and other aspects of such party and its subsidiaries as
the other party or its Representatives may reasonably request.



_Section 5.6.2_ Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, or in
the event this Agreement is terminated under any circumstance, Manpower and
the Company will maintain in confidence, and will cause their respective
Representatives to maintain in confidence, and not use to the detriment of
another party, any written, electronic, oral, or other information obtained in
confidence from another party in connection with this Agreement or the
Merger, in accordance with the terms of that certain Confidentiality
Agreement dated as of October 27, 2003 by and between Manpower and the Company
and the terms of that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated as of December
5, 2003 by and between Manpower and the Company.



_Section 5.6.3 _ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement or in any other written or oral understanding or agreement to which
the parties hereto are parties or by which they are bound, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any obligations of confidentiality contained
herein and therein shall not apply to the Tax treatment and Tax structure of
the Transaction upon the earliest to occur of (A) the date of the public
announcement of discussions relating to the Transaction, (B) the date of the
public announcement of the Transaction, or (C) the date of the execution of
this Agreement, all within the meaning of and to the extent required by
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4; _provided_ ,  



 

55   _however_ , that no party is restricted in discussing the Tax structure or
the Tax treatment of the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with its tax advisors at any time.



_Section 5.7_ _No Solicitation of Transactions_.



_Section 5.7.1_ Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or
negotiations with any parties (other than Manpower) conducted heretofore with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal and promptly request that all confidential
information with respect thereto furnished on behalf of the Company be
returned.



_Section 5.7.2_ Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, directly
or indirectly, take (and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall
authorize or permit its Representatives or other affiliates to take) any
action to (A) encourage, solicit, initiate or facilitate (including by way of
furnishing assistance or information) any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that constitutes, or may be reasonably expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than this Agreement and any confidentiality and
"standstill" agreement required pursuant to subsection (C) of the proviso of
this Section 5.7.2) or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (C) enter
into or participate in any way in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
any information to, any Person in connection with, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided,
however_ , that if, at any time prior to the Appointment Time, the Company
receives a written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited after the date
hereof or that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.7 and
that the Company Board and the Special Committee determine in good faith,
after consultation with their legal and financial advisors, is, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to the delivery of, a Superior Proposal,
the Company may, in response to such Superior Proposal and subject to the
Companys compliance with this Section 5.7.2 and Section 5.7.3, (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that the  



 

56  Company contemporaneously furnishes a copy to Manpower to the extent it has
not done so previously, and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent that (A)
the Company Board and the Special Committee, after consultation with and
taking into consideration the advice of their legal advisors, determine in
good faith that such action is required for the Company Board and the Special
Committee to comply with their fiduciary duties to the Company, (B) prior to
furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
with, such Person, the Company provides written notice to Manpower to the
effect that it is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, and (C) prior to furnishing such information
to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the
Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality and "standstill"
agreement on customary terms.



_Section 5.7.3_ The Company shall, as promptly as practicable (and in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt thereof), advise Manpower (the "Acquisition
Proposal Notice") of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry received by it
relating to any potential Acquisition Proposal and of the material terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, including the identity of the
Person and its affiliates making the same, or of any information requested
from it or of any negotiations or discussions being sought to be initiated
with it or any such negotiations or discussions conducted regarding
such Acquisition Proposal, shall furnish to Manpower a copy of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, if it is in writing, or a written summary of
any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, if it is not in writing, and shall
keep Manpower fully informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24
hours) with respect to the status and details, including amendments or
proposed amendments, with respect to the foregoing.



_Section 5.7.4_ Neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee
thereof (including the Special Committee) shall, or shall authorize or permit
any of its Representatives to, (A) withhold, withdraw, modify, change or fail
to make, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify, change or fail to
make, in a manner adverse to Manpower, any of the Recommendations, (B)
approve, endorse, or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse, or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (other than the Offer and the Merger), (C)
cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition
Proposal (other than the Offer  



 

57  and the Merger) or (D) release or permit the release of any Person from, or
waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement under which the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries has any rights, or fail to use commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced such agreement at the
request of Manpower. Nothing contained in this Section 5.7 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to the Company Shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
provided that such position is consistent with the Companys obligations
herein. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or Manpower, as
the case may be, from making disclosure (and such disclosure in and of itself
shall not be deemed to be a change in the Recommendations) of the fact that
an Acquisition Proposal has been proposed, the identity of the Person making
such proposal or the material terms of such proposal to the extent, and only
to the extent that, based on the advice of the Companys legal advisors, such
disclosure is required by law. Further, notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that an Acquisition Proposal is
made and the Company Board and the Special Committee determine in good faith,
after consultation with their legal and financial advisors, that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal after the Company has complied
with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.7, the Company Board or the
Special Committee, may if and only to the extent that the Company Board or
the Special Committee, after consultation with and taking into consideration
the advice of its legal advisors, determines in good faith that such action is
required for the Company Board and the Special Committee to comply with their
fiduciary duties to the Company, take any of the actions specified in clauses
(A), (B) or (D) of this Section 5.7.4, no earlier than five Business Days
following Manpowers receipt from the Company of an Acquisition Proposal
Notice.



_Section 5.7.5_ For a period of not less than five Business Days after
Manpowers receipt from the Company of an Acquisition Proposal Notice in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board and the
Special Committee have determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, if requested by Manpower, negotiate in good faith with Manpower, and
cause its Representatives to negotiate with Manpowers Representatives, to
revise this Agreement in an effort to make the Acquisition Proposal that
constituted a Superior Proposal no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.



 

58 _Section 5.8_ _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_



_Section 5.8.1_ The Company and Manpower shall use their reasonable best
efforts to (A) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (B)
obtain from any Governmental Entity any consents, licenses, Permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made by
Manpower or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid
any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including, without
limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act and any applicable antitrust
or competition Laws of any other jurisdiction), in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated herein and therein, including, without
limitation, the Offer and the Merger, and (C) make all necessary filings,
and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this
Agreement and the Offer and the Merger required under (x) the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and any other applicable federal or state securities
Laws, (y) the HSR Act and any applicable antitrust or competition Laws of any
other jurisdiction and (z) any other applicable Law; _provided_ , that
Manpower and the Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if
requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
in connection therewith, _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section
5.8.1 shall require Manpower or the Company to agree to (AA) the imposition of
conditions, (BB) the requirement of divestiture of assets or property or (CC)
the requirement of expenditure of money by Manpower or the Company to a
third party in exchange for any such consent referred to in subsection (B) of
this subsection (other than the payment of applicable filing fees). The
Company and Manpower shall furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any
applicable Law (including all information required to be included in the Offer
Documents, the Registration Statement, the Schedule 14D-9, the Proxy Statement
and the Post-Effective Amendment) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



_Section 5.8.2_ The Company and Manpower shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their  



 

59  respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain any third
party consents that are (A) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (B) required to be disclosed
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Manpower Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, or (C) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from
occurring prior to or after the Effective Time or a Manpower Material Adverse
Effect from occurring after the Effective Time. In the event that either party
shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in the first sentence
of this Section 5.8.2, such party shall use reasonable best efforts, and
shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to
minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Manpower, their respective
Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which could
reasonably be expected to result after the Effective Time, from the failure to
obtain such consent.



_Section 5.8.3_ From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each
of the parties hereto shall promptly notify the other parties in writing of
any pending or, to the knowledge of such party, threatened action, suit,
arbitration or other proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity or
any other Person (A) challenging or seeking material damages in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or the conversion of Company Common
Stock into the Merger Consideration or (B) seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or otherwise limit the right of Manpower
or any Manpower Subsidiary to own or operate all or any portion of the
businesses or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.



_Section 5.9_ _Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Manpower or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the
consummation of the Offer. Prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.



_Section 5.10 _ _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
party hereto of (A) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would
be likely to cause any representation or warranty of that party to be untrue
or inaccurate or that would result or be reasonably likely to result in any
condition that is to be complied with or satisfied pursuant to this Agreement
not to  



 

60  be so complied with or satisfied or (B) the failure of the Company or
Manpower, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to
this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 5.10 shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty that was untrue on the date hereof or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.



_Section 5.11_ _Public Announcements_. Manpower and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to the Offer or the Merger and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing
agreement with the NYSE.



_Section 5.12_ _Stock Exchange Listing_. Manpower shall promptly prepare and
submit to the NYSE a listing application covering the shares of Manpower
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Offer and the Merger and such
other shares of Manpower Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon
exercise of Manpower Options (following the Merger), and shall cause the
Manpower Shares and such other shares to be approved for listing on such
exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Appointment
Time or the Effective Time, as the case may be.



_Section 5.13 _ _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Manpower Board and the Company Board or the Special Committee shall take all
such steps as may be required in accordance with the interpretive guidance of
the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Options pursuant to this Agreement,
the Offer and the Merger, or acquisitions by any individual who will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with
respect to Manpower, of shares of Manpower Common Stock or Manpower Options
pursuant to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger, shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Such actions may
include, without limitation, the adoption of resolutions that specify that
such approval is specifically for the purpose of assuring that the individuals
identified in the resolutions fully receive the compensation intended to flow
from the transactions covered by this  



 

61  Agreement, or such other actions as may be effective to cause a disposition
or acquisition to be exempt from the application of Section 16.



_Section 5.14_ _Employee Benefit Matters_. Annex B hereto sets forth certain
agreements with respect to Companys employee benefit matters.



_Section 5.15_ _Company Headquarters_. For a period of at least 5 years after
the Effective Time, Manpower agrees that the headquarters of the business of
the Company will be maintained in either Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or the
greater Philadelphia area within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.



_Section 5.16_ _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.



_Section 5.16.1_ Manpower and the Surviving Corporation agree that the
indemnification obligations set forth in the Company Organizational Documents
shall survive the Merger (and, prior to the Effective Time, Manpower shall
cause the Organizational Documents of Merger Sub to reflect such provisions)
and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six
years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any individual who on or prior to the Effective Time was
a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or who served at the request of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise, unless such amendment
or modification is required by Law.



_Section 5.16.2_ For six years from the Effective Time, Manpower shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to the Companys current
directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO
Insurance") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy
(true and complete copies which have been previously provided to Manpower) or,
if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in
excess of 200% of the last annual premiums paid prior to the date of this
Agreement, which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be not more
than $450,000, and, in the event that any such annual premium would exceed
$900,000,  



 

62  Manpower and the Surviving Corporation shall obtain and provide the most
coverage available for a premium in the amount of $900,000. The provisions of
the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if,
with the prior written consent of Manpower, prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this Section 5.16, which
policies provide such directors and officers with coverage no less favorable
than the Companys existing policy for an aggregate period of six years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, Manpower shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder. The obligations under this Section 5.16
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any indemnitee to whom this Section 5.16 applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this Section 5.16 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.16).



_Section 5.16.3_ In the event Manpower or the Surviving Corporation (A)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (B) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.16.



_Section 5.16.4_ The provisions of this Section 5.16 shall be enforceable by
each individual identified in Section 5.16.1 and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to and not in substitution for, any other
right to indemnification or contribution that such person may have under
the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, under any acquisition contract, under the Law or otherwise.



_Section 5.16.5_ Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the provisions of this Section 5.16 may not be amended or modified
without the approval of each of the individuals identified in Section 5.16.1.



_Section 5.17_ _Takeover Statutes_. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or
regulation or any similar provision of  



 

63  the Company Organizational Documents shall become applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions described herein may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms described herein and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute, regulation or provision on the transactions
described herein.



_Section 5.18_ _Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. The Company shall take all
requisite action so that, as of the Appointment Time, the Companys 1996
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Companys 2003 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (each a "Company Purchase Plan") shall be terminated. Manpower shall
receive from the Company evidence that the Company Purchase Plans have been
terminated pursuant to a resolution of the Company Board (the form and
substance of such resolution shall be subject to review and approval of
Manpower, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The
rights of participants in the Company Purchase Plans with respect to any
offering period(s) then underway under the Company Purchase Plans, which
commence prior to the Appointment Time, shall be determined by treating the
last Business Day prior to the Appointment Time as the last day of any such
offering period(s) and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be
necessary to reflect the shortened offering period(s) but otherwise treating
such shortened offering period(s) as a fully effective and completed offering
period(s) for all purchases under the Company Purchase Plans. Prior to the
Appointment Time, the Company shall take all actions (including, if

any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (A)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts,

reasonably be expected to be pertinent to a particular section of a partys
Disclosure Schedule in light of the disclosure made in such section. The

and shall not be deemed to create or imply a standard of materiality
hereunder.

counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all
of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

such employee or independent contractor.

 2\. _General_.



(a) _Transferred Employees_. Those individuals who are employed by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be
hereinafter referred to as the "Transferred Employees."



(b) _Credit for Past Service_. After the Effective Time, Manpower shall give
or will cause Manpowers Affiliates to give the Transferred Employees full
credit for their prior service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(or any service credited as such in connection with a previous acquisition by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary): (i) for purposes of eligibility
(including without limitation initial participation and eligibility
for current benefits) and vesting, but not for purposes of benefit accruals,
under any qualified or nonqualified retirement or profit sharing plans
maintained by Manpower in which Transferred Employees may be eligible to
participate; and (ii) for all purposes under any welfare benefit plans,
"cafeteria plans" (as defined in Code Section 125), vacation plans and similar
arrangements maintained by Manpower. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, Manpower will not give credit for prior service to
Transferred Employees as regards Manpowers retiree health plan.



(c) _Waiver of Certain Limitations_. Manpower will, or will cause Manpowers
Affiliates to, waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Transferred Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees
may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other
than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect
to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time
under any welfare plan maintained for the Transferred Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transferred
Employees still have to meet the service requirements (recognizing past
service credit given in Section 2(b), above) and other eligibility criteria
under the Manpowers plans.



(d) _Manpower s Ability to Amend, Modify or Terminate Plans_. Nothing
contained in this Annex shall limit the right of Manpower or its Affiliates,
at any time and from time to time, to amend, modify or terminate, in whole or
in part, any of the plans referenced in this Annex, except that no such
amendment shall nullify the provisions of this Annex B, and Manpower hereby
reserves such right.



3\. _Employee Welfare and Retirement Plans_. The Companys existing health and
dental plans and other employee welfare benefit plans shall remain in effect
until at least the Effective Time. Thereafter, Transferred Employees will be
integrated into Manpowers health and dental plans and other employee welfare
plans at a time determined on a plan-by-plan basis by Manpower in its sole
discretion. If integration occurs during a plan year, Transferred Employees
shall receive credit for co-pays, deductibles and similar limits. Until the
Transferred Employees are integrated into  



 

2  Manpowers plans, the respective Company plans shall remain in effect. If
Manpower so requests, and as provided herein, the Company shall take
the necessary and appropriate steps to terminate and/or discontinue further
benefit accruals under any retirement plans of the Company, including the
Companys Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, the Companys Supplemental
Deferred Compensation Plan and the Companys Deferred Compensation Plan as of
the Effective Time and, also, shall provide notice of cessation of such
benefit accruals to affected plan participants at least 45 days in advance of
the Effective Time, which notice shall satisfy applicable provisions of
Section 4980F of the Internal Revenue Code (as implemented by IRS Regulation
Section 54.4980F-1) and Section 204(h) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended.

 



4\. _Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan_. As of the Effective Time, the
benefits to which Participants in the Companys Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (the "SERP") are entitled shall become vested in accordance
with Section 6.3 of the SERP and no further benefits shall be accrued
under such plan. Neither the Company nor Manpower will fund the SERP at the
Effective Time and neither will be obligated to fund the SERP after the
Effective Time.



5\. _Supplemental Deferred Compensation Plan_. As of the Effective Time, the
Company shall establish trusts as required under Section 7 of
the Supplemental Deferred Compensation Plans maintained by the Company for
each of Messrs. Louchheim, Pinola and Smith (the "Supplemental Plans").
Amounts credited to the Deferred Benefit Accounts (as defined in each
Supplemental Plan) shall become fixed as of the Effective Time and no further
benefits shall be accrued under such plans. The trusts shall administer the
payment of benefits in accordance with the Supplemental Plans.



6\. _Non-Qualified Plan Liabilities_. On and after the Effective
Time, Manpower will cause the Company to fulfill all its obligations under
the SERP, the Supplemental Plans and the Companys Non-Qualified Deferred
Compensation Plan and will guaranty all the obligations of the Company
thereunder. __

 



7\. _Modification of Employment Agreement and Change in Control
Agreement with Chief Executive Officer_. On the date hereof, to encourage the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "CEO") to remain employed
following the Appointment Time, the Company shall enter into a new Employment
Agreement with the CEO in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-1 and a new
change in Control Agreement with the CEO in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B-2, effective as of the Appointment Time.



8\. _Cessation of Chief Operating Officer s Employment_. On or about the
Appointment Time, the Chief Operating Officer of the Company ("COO") is
expected to cease to be employed by the Company. On the date hereof, the
Company will execute a Termination Agreement with the COO in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B-3 to clarify the COOs rights upon that cessation of
employment.



 

3 9\. _Consulting Agreements_. There are no consulting agreements between the
Company and its directors or former officers that cannot can be terminated
upon reasonable notice without liability to the Company.



10\. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. The Company and Manpower agree that each
Transferred Employee is an intended third party beneficiary of this Annex B.

Time, as that term is defined in a merger agreement by and between the
Company, Manpower Inc. and Manpower Acquisition Corp., entered into as of the
same date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"):



1\. _Term_. The "Term" will be a period beginning on the Effective Date and
ending on the Date of Termination, as defined in the letter to you of even
date regarding other rights and obligations on termination of your employment
(the "Change of Control Letter").



2\. _Duties_. You will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, as defined in
the Merger Agreement, you will become involved in the executive management of
Manpower through your involvement with Manpowers Executive Management Team.



3\. _Base Compensation_. You will be paid a base salary for your services
during the Term at the rate of Five Hundred Fifty Thousand ($550,000)
per year, as may be increased from time to time by the Company. Your base
compensation will be paid in accordance with the Companys regular payroll
practices with respect to such compensation as in effect from time to time.



4\. _Incentive Bonus and Long-Term Incentive Plan_. Effective as of the first
day of the calendar quarter following the Effective Date, you will be eligible
to receive incentive compensation for your services during the Term in
accordance with the Annual Bonus Plan described on _Exhibit A_. In addition,
you shall be eligible to receive compensation under the

 Long-Term Incentive Plan described on _Exhibit B_ for the period described
therein. Incentive bonuses for all periods ending before the first day of
the calendar quarter following the Effective Date shall be paid pursuant to
the bonus arrangement in effect immediately before the execution of this
Compensation Agreement.



5\. _Option Grant_. As of the Effective Date, you will be granted an option to
purchase 150,000 shares of Manpower common stock at an exercise price equal
to the most recent closing price for such shares prior to the Effective Date
(the "Manpower Options"). Such options shall vest over four years with 20%
vesting upon the two year anniversary of the Effective Date, 30% vesting on
the three year anniversary of the Effective Date and the remaining 50% vesting
on the four year anniversary of the Effective Date. Such options shall be
granted subject to the terms customarily used in other option grants to
Manpower executives except that notwithstanding such customary terms, all
Manpower Options shall immediately vest on the date of your termination except
upon the date of your termination with Cause or without Good Reason (both
terms as defined in the Change of Control Letter).



6\. _Manpower Investment_. During the Investment Period, you will hold and
beneficially own that number of shares of Manpower common stock which have a
value equivalent to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), based on the closing
price for such shares on the business day immediately preceding the Effective
Date (the "Manpower Investment"). The Investment Period shall be the three
year period following the Effective Date except that such period shall
terminate upon: (i) your termination of employment without Cause or for Good
Reason; (ii) a Change of Control; or, (iii) your death or disability. Cause,
Good Reason and Change of Control shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
the Change of Control Letter. You agree to hold the Manpower Investment in
the form a stock certificate upon which Manpower shall place a restrictive
legend reflecting the restrictions described herein.



7\. _Benefits_.



(a) During the entire Term, the Company will provide you with, and you will be
eligible for, all benefits of employment generally made available to the
executives of the Company from time to time (collectively, the "Benefits
Plans"), subject to and on a basis consistent with the terms, conditions and
overall administration of such Benefit Plans. You will be considered
for participation in Benefit Plans which by the terms thereof are
discretionary in nature (such as stock option plans of Manpower) on the same
basis as other executive personnel of the Manpower Group (defined below) of
similar rank. You also will be entitled to vacations and perquisites in
accordance with the Companys policies as in effect from time to time for
executives of the Company.



(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), the Company will continue to provide you
with or reimburse you for your accounting services and financial planning
services, all on  



 

Exhibit B-1  Page 2 Richard Pinola

December 10, 2003

Page 3



 

 the same basis as under the employment agreement between you and the Company
as in effect immediately before the execution of this Compensation
Agreement. 



(c) You will continue to participate in the Companys Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan until you are eligible to participate in a plan that will be
similar to the one currently offered by Manpower.



8\. _Expenses_. The Company will reimburse to you on a monthly basis for all
traveling, hotel, entertainment and other expenses reasonably incurred by you
in the proper performance of your duties during the Term, subject to your
compliance with the guidelines and regulations concerning expense
reimbursement issued by the Company, provided that it is understood that you
will be entitled to travel first class and a Company-provided automobile on
the same basis as under the employment agreement between you and the Company
as in effect immediately before the execution of this Compensation Agreement.



9\. _SERP Benefit_. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9,
the benefits payable to you under the Companys Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan ("SERP") are based on your average base salary for the three
prior years. The Company agrees that the actuarial valuation of your benefit
under the SERP will not be less than it would have been on the Effective Date
and if your average base salary for the three years ending on the Effective
Date were $830,000, so long as you are employed by the Company on the third
anniversary date of the Effective Date, or your employment by the Company
terminates before the third anniversary of the Effective Date for any reason
other than termination with Cause or without Good Reason. In the event you are
terminated with Cause or without Good Reason prior to the third anniversary
of the Effective Date, the Company will fix the actuarial valuation of your
benefit using the procedures described in the SERP for the period ending with
the Effective Date.



10\. _Nondisclosure and Nonsolicitation_.



(a) _Nondisclosure_.



(i) You will not, directly or indirectly, at any time during the term of your
employment with the Company or any of Manpower or its direct or indirect
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Manpower Group") or during the two-year
period following your termination of employment with the Manpower Group,
use for yourself or others, or disclose to others, any Confidential
Information (as defined below), whether or not conceived, developed, or
perfected by you and no matter how it became known to you, unless (a) you
first secure written consent of the Company to such disclosure or use, (b)
the same shall have lawfully become a matter of public knowledge other than by
your act or omission, or (c) you are ordered to disclose the same by a court
of competent jurisdiction or are otherwise required to disclose the same by
law, and you promptly notify the Company of  



 

Exhibit B-1  Page 3 Richard Pinola

Page 4



 

 such disclosure. "Confidential Information" shall mean all business
information (whether or not in written form) which relates to any company
in the Manpower Group and which is not known to the public generally (absent
your disclosure), including but not limited to confidential knowledge,
operating instructions, training materials and systems, customer lists, sales
records and documents, marketing and sales strategies and plans, market
surveys, cost and profitability analyses, pricing information, competitive
strategies, personnel-related information, and supplier lists. This obligation
will survive the termination of your employment for a period of two years and
will not be construed to in any way limit the Companys rights to protect
confidential information which constitute trade secrets under applicable trade
secrets law even after such two-year period. 



(ii) Upon your termination of employment with the Manpower Group, or at any
other time upon request of the Company, you will promptly surrender to the
Company, or destroy and certify such destruction to the Company, any
documents, materials, or computer or electronic records containing
any Confidential Information which are in your possession or under your
control.



(b) _Nonsolicitation of Employees_. You agree that you will not, at any time
during the term of your employment with the Manpower Group or during the one-
year period following your termination of employment with the Manpower Group,
either on your own account or in conjunction with or on behalf of any other
person, company, business entity, or other organization whatsoever, directly
or indirectly induce, solicit, entice or procure any person who is
an employee of any company in the Manpower Group, or has been such an
employee within the three months preceding such action, to terminate his or
her employment with the Manpower Group so as to accept employment elsewhere.



(c) _Injunction_. You recognize that irreparable and incalculable injury will
result to the Manpower Group and its businesses and properties in the event of
your breach of any of the restrictions imposed by Sections 10(a) - (b), above.
You therefore agree that, in the event of any such actual, impending or
threatened breach, the Company will be entitled, in addition to any other
remedies and damages available to it, to temporary and permanent injunctive
relief (without the necessity of posting a bond or other security)
restraining the violation, or further violation, of such restrictions by you
and by any other person or entity from whom you may be acting or who is acting
for you or in concert with you.



11\. _Successors; Binding Agreement_ . This letter agreement will be binding
on the Company and its successors and will inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, heirs and successors.

letter will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when
delivered in person, sent by telecopy, or mailed by United States registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and properly
addressed to the other party.

 



13\. _No Right to Remain Employed_. Nothing contained in this letter will be
construed as conferring upon you any right to remain employed by the Company
or any member of the Manpower Group or affect the right of the Company or any
member of the Manpower Group to terminate your employment at any time for any
reason or no reason, subject to the obligations of the Company and the
Manpower Group as set forth herein.



14\. _Modification_. No provision of this letter may be modified, waived or
discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to

be paid to you hereunder any federal, state, or local withholding or other
taxes or charges which it is, from time to time, required to withhold under
applicable law.



16\. _Controlling Law_. This Compensation Agreement and all
questions relating to its validity, interpretation and enforcement
(including, without limitation, provisions concerning limitation of actions),
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, notwithstanding the conflicts-of-law doctrines
of such state.



17\. _Provisions Separable_. The provisions of this agreement are independent
and separable from each other and no provision shall be rendered invalid or
unenforceable by virtue of the fact that for any reason any other provision
may be invalid or unenforceable in whole or part.



18\. _Previous Agreement_. This Compensation Agreement and the Change of
Control Letter will, effective upon the Effective Date, expressly supersede
any and all previous agreements or understandings relating to your employment
by the Company or the termination of such employment, and any such agreement
or agreements shall, as of the Effective Date, have no further force or
effect, except as specifically provided in this Compensation Agreement and the
Change of Control Letter. Conditioned upon the Effective Date actually
occurring, and effective as of the Effective Date, you expressly waive any
rights or claims you may now have or that may have arisen in the future under
such agreements, including, without limitation, any claim arising as a result
of a change of control under your employment agreement dated December 12,
1995, as amended from time to time, and under your Change of Control Agreement
dated August 7, 2002.

Exhibit B-1  Page 6 _EXHIBIT A_



 

 _Annual Bonus Plan_



     |  | _General_. The following describes the Annual Bonus Plan that
you will participate in during the Term. The Annual Bonus Plan is a bonus plan
that combines both objective goals stated in terms of profit growth (60-90%
of bonus potential) and Discretionary Goals (10-40% of bonus potential). The
first Bonus Period shall begin with the first day of the calendar quarter
following the Effective Date and shall end on December 31, 2004. Subsequent
Bonus Periods shall be for the calendar years thereafter. 
---|---|--- 



_Bonus Levels_



     |  | 25% of Base Salary at Threshold. 
---|---|--- 



     |  | 50% of Base Salary at Target. 
---|---|--- 



     |  | 100% of Base Salary at Outstanding. 
---|---|--- 



_Definitions_



     |  | The objective goal for Threshold is a 5% growth rate over the
Base Economic Profit for the first Bonus Period and for all subsequent Bonus
Periods, a growth rate to be set annually at the beginning of such Bonus
Period over the prior Bonus Period Annualized Economic Profit. 
---|---|--- 



     |  | The objective goal for Target is a 15% growth rate over the
Base Economic Profit for the first Bonus Period and a 15% growth rate over the
prior Bonus Period Annualized Economic Profit for all subsequent Bonus
Periods. 
---|---|--- 



     |  | The objective goal for Outstanding is a 25% growth rate over
the Base Economic Profit for the first Bonus Period and for all subsequent
Bonus Periods, a growth rate to be set annually at the beginning of such
Bonus Period over the prior Bonus Period Annualized Economic Profit. 
---|---|--- 



     |  | Base Economic Profit is an amount to be determined prior to
the beginning of the first Bonus Period that will reflect the Companys prior
and projected operating results.  
---|---|--- 

 interest of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, less a
capital charge. The capital charge shall consist of a charge based on the
capital employed by the Company times a pre-tax cost of capital of between 15%
and 20%. Annualized Economic Profit is Economic Profit for a Bonus Period
adjusted as appropriate to account for the fact a Bonus Period may be less
than a full year. 
---|---|--- 



     |  | Discretionary Goals are goals that will be considered in
determining your Annual Bonus. Such Discretionary Goals shall be discussed
between you and the Chief Executive Officer of Manpower at the beginning of
each Bonus Period. 
---|---|--- 



_Calculation and Payment of Annual Bonus_



     |  | The Annual Bonus shall be calculated for each Bonus Period
based on your achieving the objective criteria established for the Threshold,
Target and Outstanding opportunities (60-90% of the Annual Bonus) and your
achieving the Discretionary Goals as determined by the Chief Executive Officer
of Manpower (10-40% of the Annual Bonus). 
---|---|--- 



     |  | Except as otherwise communicated to you at the beginning of a
Bonus Period, performance between the Threshold and Target goals, and between
the Target and Outstanding goals, will result in a payout that is linearly
interpolated between such respective goals. Results in excess of the
Outstanding goal will be capped such that results in excess of the Outstanding
goal will result in the Outstanding bonus level. Performance that is below
the Threshold goal will result in no Annual Bonus. 
---|---|--- 



     |  | The Annual Bonus shall be paid within 90 days of the end of
the applicable Bonus Period. If your employment is terminated for any reason
other than for Cause or by you for other than Good Reason (both as defined in
the Change of Control Letter), you shall be entitled to a prorated Annual
Bonus in the year of your termination. 
---|---|--- 

 _EXHIBIT B_



 

 _Long-Term Incentive Plan_



_General_



     |  | The following describes the Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP")
you will participate in during the Bonus Periods occurring through, and
including, the Bonus Period ending December 31, 2006 (the "LTIP Term"). The
LTIP is a long-term bonus program pursuant to which you accumulate a bonus
amount (the "LTIP Amount") over the LTIP Term. 
---|---|--- 


_Bonus Calculation_



     |  | For each Bonus Period during the LTIP Term, the LTIP Amount
shall equal 10% of the amount of the excess of (i) the Companys Economic
Profit, less your Annual Bonus and less the LTIP Amount for such Bonus
Period, over (ii) the Targeted Economic Profit for such Bonus Period. The
Targeted Economic Profit shall be the minimum amount of Economic Profit
necessary to achieve the objective goal for Target for the Annual Bonus for
such Bonus Period. This LTIP Amount is determined for each Bonus Period but
shall only be paid as described herein. 
---|---|--- 



_Payment Terms_



     |  | _Payment Date_. The Company shall pay you the LTIP Amount
accumulated during the LTIP Term on or promptly after the three-year
anniversary of the Effective Date.  
---|---|--- 



     |  | _Termination_. Payment of any of the LTIP Amount is dependent
upon your being employed by the Company on the three-year anniversary of the
Effective Date, provided, however, that in the event your employment
terminates for any reason other than your termination with Cause or without
Good Reason (both terms as defined in the Change of Control Letter) prior to
such date, the Company shall pay you the LTIP Amount accumulated for the
completed Bonus Periods prior to such termination date on a prorated basis for
any interim period up to the termination date. Disability shall mean that you
have become disabled and entitled to benefits under the terms of the long-
term disability plan of Manpower.

Dear Mr. Pinola:



Manpower Inc. (the "Corporation") desires to retain experienced, well-

contemplated subsidiary Right Management Consultants, Inc. ("Right") to assure
the continued growth and success of the Corporation and all of its direct and

inducement for you to continue your employment in order to assure the
continued availability of your services to the Manpower Group, we have agreed
to the terms set forth in this letter agreement (the "Change of Control
Letter"). The terms of this Change of Control Letter will become effective
(the "Effective Date") upon the Appointment Time, as that term is defined in
a merger agreement by and between the Corporation, Right and the Manpower
Acquisition Corp., entered into as of the same date hereof.



   1. | _Definitions_. For purposes of this Change of Control Letter: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | _Cause_. Termination by the Manpower Group of your
employment with the Manpower Group for "Cause" will mean termination upon (i)
your gross misconduct or (ii) your conviction or plea of guilty or _nolo
contendere_ to a crime which substantially relates to the circumstances of
your position with the Manpower Group, is demonstrably and materially
injurious to the Corporation or which has material adverse effect on the
Manpower Group. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Change of Control_. A "Change of Control" will mean the
first to occur of the following: 
---|---|---

ownership (within the meaning of Exchange Act Rule 13d-3) of more than 50% of
the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation or voting
securities representing more than 50% of the   

---|---|--- 

 Richard Pinola

December 10, 2003



      |

 combined voting power of the Corporations then outstanding voting
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors;
provided, however, no Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred as a
result of an acquisition of shares of common stock or voting securities of the
Corporation (A) by the Corporation, any of its subsidiaries, or any employee
benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Corporation or
any of its subsidiaries or (B) by any other corporation or other entity with
respect to which, following such acquisition, more than 60% of the outstanding
shares of the common stock, and voting securities representing more than 60%
of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, of such other
corporation or entity are then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by
the persons who were the Corporations shareholders immediately prior to such
acquisition in substantially the same proportions as their ownership,
immediately prior to such acquisition, of the Corporations then
outstanding common stock or then outstanding voting securities, as the case
may be; or 

---|--- 



     | (ii) | the consummation of any merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation
which results in more than 60% of the outstanding shares of the common stock,
and voting securities representing more than 60% of the combined voting power
of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors, of the surviving or consolidated corporation being
then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the persons who were the
Corporations shareholders immediately prior to such merger or consolidation
in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to
such merger or consolidation, of the Corporations then outstanding common
stock or then outstanding voting securities, as the case may be; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | the consummation of any liquidation or dissolution of the
Corporation or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Corporation; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

individuals who, as of the date of this letter, constitute the Board of
Directors of the Corporation (as of such date, the "Incumbent Board") cease
for any reason to constitute at least a majority of such Board; provided,
however, that any person becoming a director subsequent to the date of this
letter whose election, or nomination for election by the shareholders of the
Corporation, was approved by at least a majority of the directors then
comprising the Incumbent Board shall be, for purposes of this letter,
considered as though such person were a member of the   

---|---|--- 



 

2 Richard Pinola

December 10, 2003



      |

 Incumbent Board but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose
initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or
threatened election contest which was (or, if threatened, would have been)
subject to Exchange Act Rule 14a-12(c); or 

---|--- 



     | (v) | whether or not conditioned on shareholder approval, the
issuance by the Corporation of common stock of the Corporation representing a
majority of the outstanding common stock, or voting securities representing a
majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of
the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, after
giving effect to such transaction.  
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | while you are employed by Right, the acquisition in any one
transaction or series of transactions by one or more persons other than
members of the Manpower Group (A) of all or substantially all of the assets
of Right or (B) of more than 50% of the then outstanding shares of common
stock of Right or voting securities representing more than 50% of the combined
voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of Right entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors. 
---|---|--- 



Following the occurrence of an event which is not a Change of Control whereby
there is a successor holding company to the Corporation, or, if there is no
such successor, whereby the Corporation is not the surviving corporation in a
merger or consolidation, the surviving corporation or successor holding
company (as the case may be), for purposes of this letter, shall thereafter be
referred to as the Corporation.



     | (c) | _Good Reason_. "Good Reason" will mean, without your
consent, the occurrence of any one or more of the following during the Term: 
---|---|--- 


     | (i) | a reduction in the duties assigned to you that is material
based on your overall responsibilities and authority (ignoring incidental
duties) prior to and after such reduction in duties, provided you object to
such reduction in duties by written notice to the Corporation within twenty
business days after it is made and the Corporation fails to cure, if
necessary, within ten business days after such notice is given;  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | any material breach of the Compensation Agreement or this
Change of Control Letter by the Corporation which remains uncured ten business
days after you give written notice to the Corporation which specifies the
breach; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

any reduction in your base salary as in effect from time to time or a failure
by the Manpower Group to provide an arrangement for you for any fiscal

 year of the Manpower Group giving you the opportunity to earn an incentive
bonus for such year;

the Rights home office in Pennsylvania provided you deliver a Notice of
Termination to the Manpower Group within ninety days after you are notified of
any such requirement to change location; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | any reduction in the amount of the annual bonus received by
you for a given fiscal year (calculated on a prorated basis for partial years)
within two years after the occurrence of a Change of Control, as compared to
the amount of the annual bonus received by you (prorated for comparison to
partial years) for either of the two fiscal years of the Manpower Group
immediately preceding the fiscal year in which a Change of Control occurred,
unless the bonus for such given fiscal year is based on criteria to which you
have agreed. 
---|---|--- 



Your continued employment or failure to give Notice of Termination will not
constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any
circumstance constituting Good Reason hereunder except as otherwise provided.



     | (d) | _Notice of Termination_. Any termination of your employment
by the Corporation and/or Right, or termination by you for Good Reason during

      |

 no case will the Protected Period commence earlier than the date that is six
months prior to the Change of Control; 

---|--- 


     | (ii) | if a Change of Control is triggered by a merger or
consolidation of the Corporation with any other corporation, the Protected
Period shall commence on the date that serious and substantial discussions
first take place to effect the merger or consolidation and shall continue
through and including the date of the Change of Control, provided that in no
case will the Protected Period commence earlier than the date that is
six months prior to the Change of Control; and 
---|---|---

(i) your full base salary as then in effect through the Date of Termination,
(ii) any incentive compensation payable to you in accordance with the
incentive compensation plans referred to in the Compensation Agreement and
(iii) all benefits to which you are entitled under any Benefit Plans in

      | (E) | for a 24-month period after the Date of Termination, the
Corporation and/or Right will arrange (i) to provide you with the benefits
described in Paragraph 7(b) of the Compensation Agreement for the 24-month
period following your Date of Termination; and (ii) to provide you and your

medical, dental, life, and disability plans of the Manpower Group, or
benefits substantially similar to the benefits you were receiving during the
90-day period immediately prior to the time Notice of Termination is given
under the named plans; provided, however, that benefits otherwise receivable
by you pursuant to this Subsection 2(c)(i)(E)(ii) will be reduced to the
extent other comparable benefits are actually received by you during the
24-month period following your termination, and any such benefits actually
received by you will be reported to the Corporation; provided, further that
any insurance continuation coverage that you may be entitled to receive under
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 ("COBRA") will
commence on the Date of Termination.  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | If your employment with the Manpower Group is terminated
during the Term for any reason not specified in Subsection 2(a) or (b), above,
and Subsection 2(c)(i) does not apply to the termination, you will be
entitled to the following:

     | (A) | the Corporation and/or Right will pay you your full base
salary through the Date of Termination at the rate then in effect;

---|---|--- 



 

7 Richard Pinola

December 10, 2003



      | (E) | for the twelve-month period after the Date of Termination,
you and your eligible dependents will continue to receive benefits under the
medical and dental plans of the Corporation as if your employment by the
Corporation and/or Right did not terminate; provided, that the payments or
benefits otherwise receivable by you pursuant to this Subsection 2(c)(ii)(E)
will be reduced to the extent other comparable payments or benefits are
actually received by you during the twelve-month period following your
termination, and any such payments or benefits actually received by you will
be reported to the Corporation; and provided, further that any insurance
continuation coverage that you may be entitled to receive under COBRA or
similar state laws will commence on the Date of Termination; 
---|---|--- 



The amounts paid to you pursuant to Subsection 2(c)(i)(D) or 2(c)(ii)(D) will
not be included as compensation for purposes of any qualified or nonqualified
pension or welfare benefit plan of the Manpower Group. Notwithstanding the
above, if the Corporation, based on advice of its legal or tax counsel,
determines that any of the amounts otherwise to be paid to you pursuant to
Subsection 2(c)(i)(D) or 2(c)(ii)(D), when added to any other payment or
benefit received or to be received by you in connection with the Change of
Control or the termination of your employment, will be subject to the excise
tax imposed by section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any similar tax
that hereafter may be imposed), the amounts otherwise to be paid to you
pursuant to Subsection 2(c)(i)(D) or 2(i)(ii)(D) will be reduced to the
maximum amount that will result in no portion of the amounts to be paid to
you pursuant to Subsection 2(c)(i)(D) or 2(c)(ii)(D) being subject to such
excise tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the reduction of benefits described
above in the previous sentence shall not apply in the event that the
provisions in Subsection 2(d)(i) below apply because of an Option
Acceleration.



     | (d) | _Golden Parachute Tax_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Change of Control Letter to the
contrary, in the event that the accelerated vesting of stock options which
were granted to you by the Corporation on the Effective Date (the "Manpower
Options" and the "Option Acceleration") causes any payment or distribution to
or for your benefit from the Corporation or any affiliate of the Corporation
(a "Payment" or "Payments") to become subject to the excise tax imposed by
section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or
any interest or penalties are incurred by you with respect to such excise tax
(such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are collectively
referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then you shall be entitled to receive an
additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment")   

---|---|--- 



 

8 Richard Pinola

December 10, 2003



      |

 in an amount such that after payment by you of all taxes (including any
interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any
Excise Tax, imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, you retain an amount of the
Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. For these
purposes, the Manpower Options will cause a payment to be subject to the
Excise Tax if Payments would not be subject to the Excise Tax if there Option
Acceleration is not considered but such Payments do become subject to the
Excise Tax when the Option Acceleration is considered. 

---|--- 


     | (ii) | A determination shall be made as to whether and when a
Gross-Up Payment is required pursuant to this Section 2(d) and the amount of
such Gross-Up Payment, such determination to be made within fifteen business
days of the Date of Termination, or such other time as requested by the
Corporation or by you (provided you reasonably believe that any of the
Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax). Such determination shall be
made by a national independent accounting firm selected by you (the
"Accounting Firm"). All fees, costs and expenses (including, but not limited
to, the cost of retaining experts) of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by
the Corporation and the Corporation shall pay such fees, costs and expenses
as they become due. The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting
calculations, acceptable to you, both to the Corporation and you. The Gross-Up
Payment, if any, as determined pursuant to this Subsection 2(d)(ii) shall be
paid by the Corporation to you within five business days of the receipt of the
Accounting Firms determination. Any such initial determination by the
Accounting Firm of whether or when a Gross-Up Payment is required and, if
such a payment is required, the amount thereof shall be binding upon the
Corporation and you subject to the application of Subsection 2(d)(iii). 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

As a result of the uncertainty in the application of sections 4999 and 280G of
the Code, it is possible that a Gross-Up Payment (or a portion thereof) will
be paid which should not have been paid (an "Overpayment") or a Gross-Up
Payment (or a portion thereof) which should have been paid will not have been
paid (an "Underpayment"). An Underpayment shall be deemed to have occurred
upon notice (formal or informal) to you from any governmental taxing
authority that your tax liability (whether in respect of your then current
taxable year or in respect of any prior taxable year) may be increased by
reason of the imposition of the Excise Tax on a Payment or Payments with
respect to which the Corporation has failed to make a sufficient Gross-Up
Payment. An Overpayment shall be deemed to have occurred upon a "Final
Determination" (as hereinafter defined) that the Excise Tax shall not be
imposed upon a Payment or Payments with respect   

---|---|--- 



 

9 Richard Pinola

December 10, 2003



      |

 to which you had previously received a Gross-Up Payment. A Final
Determination shall be deemed to have occurred when you have received from the
applicable governmental taxing authority a refund of taxes or other reduction
in your tax liability by reason of the Overpayment and upon either (A) the
date a determination is made by, or an agreement is entered into with, the
applicable governmental taxing authority which finally and conclusively binds
you and such taxing authority, or in the event that a claim is brought before
a court of competent jurisdiction, the date upon which a final determination
has been made by such court and either all appeals have been taken and
finally resolved or the time for all appeals has expired or (B) the expiration
of the statute of limitations with your applicable tax return. If an
Underpayment occurs, you shall promptly notify the Corporation and
the Corporation shall pay to you at least five business days prior to the
date on which the applicable governmental taxing authority has requested
payment, an additional Gross-Up Payment equal to the amount of the
Underpayment plus any interest and penalties imposed on the Underpayment. If
an Overpayment occurs, the amount of the Overpayment shall be treated as a
loan by the Corporation to you and you shall, within ten business days of the
occurrence of such Overpayment, pay to the Corporation the amount of the
Overpayment plus interest at an annual rate equal to the rate provided for in
section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the date the Gross-Up Payment (to which
the Overpayment relates) was paid to you. 

---|--- 


     | (iv) | Notwithstanding anything contained in this letter to the
contrary, in the event it is determined that an Excise Tax will be imposed on
any Payment or Payments, the Corporation shall pay to the applicable
governmental taxing authorities as Excise Tax withholding, the amount of the
Excise Tax that the Corporation has actually withheld from the Payment or
Payments. 
---|---|--- 


     | (e) | _Payment_. The payments provided for in Subsections 2(c) or
2(d), above, will be made not later than the later of (i) the tenth business
day following the Date of Termination or (ii) the date on which the Release
referred to in Section 2(f) becomes irrevocable. If any of such payments is
not made when due (hereinafter a "Delinquent Payment"), in addition to such
principal sum, the Corporation will pay you interest on any and all such
Delinquent Payments from the date due computed at the prime rate, compounded
monthly. If any of such payments is not made when due (hereinafter a
"Delinquent Payment"), in addition to such principal sum, the Corporation
and/or Right will pay you interest on any and all such Delinquent Payments
from the date due computed at the prime rate, plus 5%, as published in the
Midwest edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ , compounded monthly.  
---|---|--- 



 

10 Richard Pinola

December 10, 2003



      | (f) | _Release of Claims_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Corporation or Right will pay you, and you have no right to
receive, any benefits described in Section 2, above, unless and until you
execute, and there shall be effective following any statutory period for
revocation, a release, in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A to this
Change of Control Letter. 
---|---|--- 


     | (g) | _Forfeiture_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, your right to
receive the payments and benefits to be provided to you under this Section 2
beyond those described in Subsection 2(a), above, is conditioned upon your
performance of the obligations stated in Section 3, below, and in Section 9 of
the Compensation Agreement, and upon your breach of any such obligations, you
will immediately return to the Corporation the amount of such payments and
benefits and you will no longer have any right to receive any such payments or
benefits. 
---|---|--- 



   3. | _Noncompetition Agreement_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | _Noncompetition_. During the term of your employment with
the Manpower Group, you will not assist any competitor of any company in the
Manpower Group in any capacity. During the one-year period which immediately
follows the termination of your employment with the Manpower Group, you will
not, directly or indirectly, provide services or assistance of a nature
similar to the services provided to the Manpower Group during the term of
your employment with the Manpower Group to any entity engaged in the business
of providing temporary staffing services anywhere in the United States or any
other country in which the Manpower Group conducts business as of the Date
of Termination which has, together with its affiliated entities, annual
revenues from such business in excess of $500,000,000. In addition, during the
one-year period which immediately follows the termination of your employment
with the Manpower Group, you will not, directly or indirectly, provide
services or assistance of a nature similar to the services provided to Right
during the term of your employment with the Manpower Group to any entity
engaged in the business of providing career transition and organizational
consulting anywhere in the United States or any other country in which Right
conducts business as of the Date of Termination which has, together with its
affiliated entities, annual revenues from such business in excess of
$100,000,000. You acknowledge that the scope of this limitation is reasonable
in that, among other things, providing any such services or assistance during
such one-year period would permit you to use unfairly your close
identification with the Manpower Group and/or Right and would involve the use
or disclosure of confidential information pertaining to the Manpower Group. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

_Injunction_. You recognize that irreparable and incalculable injury will
result to the Manpower Group and its businesses and properties in the event of
your breach   

---|---|--- 



 

11 Richard Pinola

December 10, 2003



      |

 of any of the restrictions imposed by Subsection 3(a), above. You therefore
agree that, in the event of any such actual, impending or threatened breach,
the Corporation and/or Right will be entitled, in addition to the remedies
set forth in Subsection 2(h), above, and any other remedies and damages, to
temporary and permanent injunctive relief (without the necessity of posting a
bond or other security) restraining the violation, or further violation, of
such restrictions by you and by any other person or entity from whom you may
be acting or who is acting for you or in concert with you. 

---|--- 


     | (c) | _Nonapplication_. Notwithstanding the above, this Section 3
will not apply if your employment with the Corporation and/or Right is
terminated by you for Good Reason or by the Corporation without Cause either
during a Protected Period or within two years after the occurrence of a Change
of Control. 
---|---|--- 



   4. | _Vesting of Options_. Except in the event the termination of your
employment is for Cause or without Good Reason, any unvested options you hold
on the Termination Date will vest and become immediately exercisable at such
time. 
---|--- 



   5. | _Unemployment Compensation_. The severance benefits provided for
in Subsection 2(c)(i)(D) will be assigned for unemployment compensation
benefit purposes to the two-year period following the Date of Termination,
and the severance benefits provided for in Subsection 2(c)(ii)(D) will be
assigned for unemployment compensation purposes to the one-year period
following the Date of Termination, and you will be ineligible to receive, and
you agree not to apply for, unemployment compensation during such periods. 
---|--- 



   6. | _No Mitigation_. You will not be required to mitigate the amount
of any payment or benefit provided for in Section 2 by seeking other
employment or otherwise, nor will the amount of any payment provided for in
Section 2, unless otherwise provided herein, be reduced by any compensation
earned by you as the result of employment by another employer after the Date
of Termination, or otherwise. 
---|--- 


   7. |

_Nondisparagement_. Upon your termination of employment with the Manpower
Group for any reason, the Manpower Group agrees to maintain a positive
and constructive attitude and demeanor toward you, and agrees to refrain from
making any derogatory comments or statements of a negative nature about you.
Upon your termination of employment with the Manpower Group for any reason,
you agree to maintain a positive and constructive attitude and demeanor
toward the Manpower Group, and agree to refrain from making derogatory
comments or statements of a negative nature about the Manpower Group, its
officers, directors, shareholders, agents, partners, representatives and
employees, to anyone. However, the foregoing will not preclude Manpower and/or
Right from providing truthful information about you concerning your employment
or termination of employment with the Manpower in response to an inquiry from
a prospective employer in   

---|--- 



 

12 Richard Pinola

      |

 connection with your possible employment, and will not preclude either party
from providing truthful testimony pursuant to subpoena or other legal process
or in the course of any proceeding that may be commenced for purposes of
enforcing this agreement. 

---|--- 



   8. | _Successors; Binding Agreement_. This Change of Control Letter
will be binding on the Corporation and its successors and will inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives,
heirs and successors. 
---|--- 



   9. | _Notice_. Notices and all other communications provided for in
this letter will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when
delivered in person, sent by telecopy, or mailed by United States registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and properly
addressed to the other party. 
---|--- 



   10. | _No Right to Remain Employed_. Nothing contained in this letter
will be construed as conferring upon you any right to remain employed by the
Corporation or any member of the Manpower Group or affect the right of the
Corporation or any member of the Manpower Group to terminate your employment
at any time for any reason or no reason, subject to the obligations of the
Corporation and the Manpower Group as set forth herein.  
---|--- 



   11. | _Modification_. No provision of this letter may be modified,
waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed
to in writing by you and the Corporation.

   12. | _Withholding_. The Corporation shall be entitled to withhold
from amounts to be paid to you hereunder any federal, state, or local
withholding or other taxes or charges which it is, from time to time,
required to withhold under applicable law. 
---|--- 



   13. | _Previous Agreement_. This letter, upon acceptance by you, and
the Compensation Agreement expressly supersedes any and all previous
agreements or understandings relating to your employment by the Corporation,
Right or any other of the Manpower Group or the termination of such
employment, and any such agreement or agreements shall, as of the date of your
acceptance, have no further force or effect.  
---|--- 



   14. | _Controlling Law_. This Change of Control Letter and all
questions relating to its validity, interpretation and enforcement (including,
without limitation, provisions concerning limitations of actions), shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, notwithstanding the conflicts-of-law doctrines of such state. 
---|--- 


   15. | _Provisions Separable_. The provisions of this agreement are
independent and separable from each other and no provision shall be rendered
invalid or unenforceable by virtue of the fact that for any reason any other
provision may be invalid or unenforceable in whole or part.

John Gavin

1612 Claudia Way

North Wales, PA 19454



Dear Mr. Gavin:



This will confirm our understanding concerning the termination of your
employment with Right (the "Company"). The Company is involved in discussions
with Manpower Inc. ("Manpower"), which would result in a change of control, as
that term is defined in your Change of Control Agreement dated August 7,
2002. The date of which the change in control would take place is the date
Manpower would appoint a number of new directors to the board of directors of
the Company who constitute a majority of the board of directors of the
Company (the "Appointment Date"). You have indicated that you would decline an
opportunity to be employed with the Company after the Appointment Date.



You and the Company agree that effective on the date you terminate
your employment with the Company (the "Termination Date"), which will be
after December 31, 2003 and not more than 60 days after the Appointment Date,
to the following:



     | 1. | The Company will pay you your unpaid current base salary,
including your accrued, but unused vacation time through the Termination Date.
The Company will reimburse you for any and all business expenses properly
submitted for payment through the Termination Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | You and the Company acknowledge that you will retain all your
vested rights as of the Termination Date in the Companys 401(k)/retirement
plan, and that, as of the Termination Date, notwithstanding any provision in
any of the following plans, programs or arrangements to the contrary, you
shall be fully vested in all stock options granted to you under the Companys
Stock Option Plan(s) that remain unexercised as of the Termination Date, and
fully vested in your accrued benefit under each of the Companys Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan, the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the
Companys Supplemental Deferred Compensation Agreement and the Companys
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. 
---|---|--- 

 Mr. John Gavin

December 10, 2003

      | 3. | Within thirty (30) days of the Termination Date, the
Company shall pay you, in a single cash lump sum, subject to required tax
withholding, the sum of (i) the amount credited to your bookkeeping account
under the Companys Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, (ii) the amount
credited to your bookkeeping account under the Companys Supplemental Deferred
Compensation Agreement and (iii) the present value of your accrued benefit
under the Companys Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, as determined
based on the assumptions stated in Exhibit B, which is incorporated herein by
this reference. 
---|---|--- 


     | 4. | The Company shall pay to you an amount of severance pay
calculated in accordance with the calculation set forth on Exhibit A, which is

_AFFILIATE LETTER_



Manpower Inc.

5301 North Ironwood Road

Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53217

Attn: Michael J. Van Handel



Gentlemen:



I have been advised that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Right Management Consultants, Inc., a Pennsylvania
corporation (the "Company"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes
of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulation (the "Rules
and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December
, 2003 (the "Agreement"), by and among Manpower Inc., a Wisconsin corporation
("Manpower"), Hoosier Acquisition Corp., a Pennsylvania Corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Manpower ("Merger Sub") and the Company, Manpower
will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the "Company Securities") in an exchange offer (the "Exchange
Offer") and subsequent merger (together with the Exchange Offer,
the "Transaction").



As a result of the Transaction, I may receive shares of Manpower common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Manpower Securities"). I would receive
such shares in exchange for, respectively, shares owned by me of the Company
Securities.



I represent, warrant and covenant to Manpower that in the event I receive
any Manpower Securities as a result of the Transaction:



A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Manpower
Securities in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.



B. I have carefully read this letter and the Agreement and discussed its
requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of Manpower Securities to the extent I felt
necessary, with my counsel or counsel for the Company.



C. I have been advised that the issuance of Manpower Securities to me pursuant
to the Transaction is to be registered with the Commission under the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that
since, at the time the commencement of the Exchange Offer, I may be deemed to
have been an affiliate of the Company and the distribution by me of
the Manpower Securities has not been registered under the Act, and that I may not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of Manpower Securities issued to me in the Transaction unless (i)
such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act,
(ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the
volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under
the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Manpower,
such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration
under the Act.



D. I understand that Manpower is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of the Manpower Securities by me or on my behalf
under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available.



E. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Manpowers transfer agents with respect to the Manpower Securities and that
there will be placed on the certificates for the Manpower Securities issued to
me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:



"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE
SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED  _ _BETWEEN THE
REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND MANPOWER, A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT
THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF MANPOWER."



F. I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Manpower Securities
has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the
Provisions of Rule 145, Manpower reserves the right to put the following
legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:



"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH
SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW
TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE
MEANING OF SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."

 It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraph E and F
above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to Manpower a copy of a letter
from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Manpower, to the effect that such legend
is not required for purposes of the Act.



Very truly yours,
