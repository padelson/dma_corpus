the Voyage Holdings Organizational Documents and VMG Blocker Organizational
Documents, as applicable, and any other applicable organizational documents of
the Target Companies then in effect and any other applicable Material
Contracts governing the distribution of equity proceeds pursuant to this
Agreement to any equityholder of the Target Companies. Buyer shall be entitled
to definitively rely upon and shall incur no Liability as a result of its
reliance on the Allocation Schedule and any payments and allocations made in
accordance therewith pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_. The Sellers
Representative and VMG Tax-Exempt will consult with Buyer with respect to the
calculations set forth in the Allocation Schedule, and all of the calculations
and amounts set forth therein, together with any changes incorporated by the

absent manifest error.

 



      

 

 



 

Section 2.06 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Promptly, but in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative and to VMG Tax-
Exempt a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers
good-faith determination of (A) the Aggregate Consideration and each of its
components set forth in clauses (a) through (i) in the definition thereof
(each a " _Final Closing Calculation_ " and collectively, the " _Final Closing
Calculations_ "), in each case determined on a consolidated basis in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with, to the extent not
inconsistent with GAAP, the methodologies, practices, estimation techniques,
assumptions and principles used in the preparation of the Audited Financial
Statements or VMG Blocker Financial Statements, and the Sample Working
Capital, as applicable, and (B) the Proposed Adjustment Amount, in each case
of clause (A) and (B), together with such detail and supporting documentation
as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Sellers Representative and VMG Tax-
Exempt, as applicable. The " _Proposed Adjustment Amount_ " shall be equal to
(which may be a positive or negative number) Buyers determination of the
Aggregate Consideration as set forth on the Post-Closing Statement delivered
pursuant to this _Section 2.06(a)_ _ minus _the Sellers Representatives
and VMG Blockers determination of Closing Consideration as set forth in the
Closing Certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 2.05_ (Closing
Certificate); _provided_ , _however_ , that any Proposed Adjustment Amount
owing by the Sellers to Buyer shall not exceed the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

 



 

(b) If the (i) Sellers Representative disagrees with Buyers determination of
any Final Closing Calculation or the resulting Proposed Adjustment Amount
applicable to the Quest Sellers or (ii) VMG Tax Exempt disagrees with Buyers
determination of any Final Closing Calculation or the resulting Proposed
Adjustment Amount applicable to VMG Tax-Exempt, in each case as reflected on
the Post-Closing Statement, the Sellers Representative and/or VMG Tax-Exempt
may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Post-Closing Statement,
deliver a written notice (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer setting forth in
reasonable detail the grounds for such disputes and its calculation of each
disputed amount (each an " _Item of Dispute_ "). In preparing such Dispute
Notice, the Sellers Representative and VMG Tax-Exempt shall, upon reasonable
advance notice, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal
business operations of the Target Companies, have reasonable access to all
items and personnel reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative and
VMG Tax-Exempt related to the Post-Closing Statement. If Buyer does not
receive a Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Sellers
Representative or VMG Tax-Exempt of the Post-Closing Statement, the Post-
Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties. If
Buyer receives a Dispute Notice from the Sellers Representative or VMG Tax-
Exempt within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Sellers Representative
and VMG Tax-Exempt of the Post-Closing Statement, Buyer, the Sellers
Representative and VMG Tax-Exempt shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve each Item of Dispute, and, if any Item of Dispute is so resolved, the
Post-Closing Statement shall be modified to the extent necessary to reflect
such resolution. If any Item of Dispute remains unresolved as of the twentieth
(20th) day after delivery by the Sellers Representative and/or VMG Tax-Exempt
of the Dispute Notice, Buyer, the Sellers Representative and VMG Tax-Exempt
shall jointly retain KPMG US LLP, or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to
act or if such firm has been engaged by any of the Parties from or after the
date hereof and is thus no longer "independent", an independent "Big 4"
accounting firm of recognized international standing as may be mutually agreed
to by Buyer the Sellers Representative and VMG Tax-Exempt, as applicable (the
" _Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve such remaining disagreement. If Buyer, the
Sellers Representative and VMG Tax-Exempt are unable to agree on the choice
of the Accounting Firm within a 15-day period, then the Accounting Firm shall
be the dispute resolution group of an accounting firm of national standing
designated by the American Arbitration Association in New York, New York
(which it determines does not have any material relationship with Buyer, the
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates). Buyer, the Sellers
Representative and VMG Tax-Exempt shall request that the Accounting Firm
render a determination as to each unresolved Item of Dispute within thirty
(30) days after its retention. Buyer, Sellers Representative, Voyage
Holdings, its Subsidiaries, VMG Tax-Exempt, VMG Blocker and their respective
Representatives, as applicable, shall cooperate fully with the Accounting Firm
so as to enable it to make such determination as quickly and accurately as
practicable, including the provision by Buyer and the Target Companies of all
books and records and work papers

 



     

 

 



 

(including those of accountants) relating to the Post-Closing Statement (with
a copy to the other Party) and all other items reasonably requested by the
Accounting Firm. Buyer and the Sellers Representative and/or VMG Tax-Exempt,
as applicable shall be entitled to submit (with a copy to the other party) to
the Accountant such documents and materials and to make such presentations and
arguments as such party shall deem necessary or appropriate; _provided_ that
the Parties agree that no Party shall have any _ex parte_ communications with
the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall (i) limit its review to only
those Items of Dispute that were set forth in the Post-Closing Statement and
the Dispute Notice and that remain unresolved by Buyer, the Sellers
Representative and VMG Tax-Exempt, (ii) be bound by the terms of this
Agreement, including any definitions, (iii) only consider the documents,
materials, presentations and arguments made by Buyer, the Sellers
Representative and VMG Tax-Exempt, as applicable ( _i.e_., shall not engage in
any independent review) and (iv) act as an expert (and not an arbitrator). In
resolving any Item of Dispute, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to
any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either
Person in the Post-Closing Statement or the Dispute Notice (as applicable) or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Person. The
Accounting Firms determination(s) shall be based upon the definitions in the
Post-Closing Statement or the Dispute Notice (as applicable) included in this
Agreement. The Accounting Firms determination of each Item of Dispute
submitted to it shall be in writing, shall conform with this _Section 2.06_
and shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon each of the
Parties, and the Post-Closing Statement shall be modified to the extent
necessary to reflect such binding determination(s). The Accounting Firm shall
provide a determination of the "Final Adjustment Amount" which shall be equal
to (which may be a positive or negative number) the Accounting Firms
determination of Aggregate Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.06_
_minus_ the Sellers Representative or VMG Tax-Exempts, as applicable,
determination of Closing Consideration set forth in the Closing Certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.05_ (Closing Certificate); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Proposed Adjustment Amount owing by Sellers to Buyer
shall not exceed the Adjustment Escrow Amount. The Accounting Firm shall
allocate its fees, costs and expenses between Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) or VMG Tax-Exempts, as
applicable, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of
the contested amount not awarded to each such Party bears to the amount
actually contested by such Party.

 



 

(c) The " _Final Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be a positive or negative
number, shall be equal to (i) the amount agreed to as the Final Adjustment
Amount at any time in writing by Buyer, the Sellers Representative and VMG
Tax-Exempt; (ii) if a Dispute Notice is not delivered by the Sellers
Representative or VMG Tax-Exempt to Buyer within the time period required by
_Section 2.06(b)_, the Proposed Adjustment Amount set forth in the Post-
Closing Statement; or (iii) the Final Adjustment Amount as set forth in the
written determination of the Accounting Firm made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.06_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Final
Adjustment Amount owing by Sellers to Buyer shall not exceed the Adjustment
Escrow Amount.

 



 

(d) _Payments_. Within five (5) days after the determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount, (i) if the Final Adjustment Amount (A) is a positive number
and payable by Buyer to the Quest Sellers, Buyer shall pay (or cause to be
paid) to the account(s) designated in writing by the Sellers Representative
(for the benefit of the Quest Sellers, other than holders of Class M Units of
Voyage Holdings) an amount in cash equal to the Final Adjustment Amount or (B)
is a positive number and payable from Buyer to VMG Tax-Exempt, Buyer shall pay
(or cause to be paid) to the account(s) designated in writing by VMG Tax
Exempt an amount in cash equal to the Final Adjustment Amount; (ii) if the
Final Adjustment Amount (A) is a negative number and payable by the Quest
Sellers to Buyer, the Sellers Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to
pay to the account designated in writing by Buyer (x) an amount in cash from
the Adjustment Escrow Amount equal to the lesser of the Final Adjustment
Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (b) is a negative number and
payable by VMG Tax-Exempt to Buyer, VMG Tax-Exempt shall pay or cause to be
paid to the account(s) designated in writing by Buyer an amount in cash equal
to the Final Adjustment Amount. VMG Tax-Exempt agrees that from the Closing

 



     

 

 



 

until the Final Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.06_, it shall retain from the Closing Consideration paid to VMG
Tax-Exempt, and not distribute or otherwise utilize, an amount equal to
$1,000,000 in support of any potential payment obligations of VMG Tax Exempt
under this _Section 2.06(d)_. Any payments made pursuant to this _Section
2.06_ shall be treated by the Parties hereunder as an adjustment to the cash
proceeds received by the Sellers in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate amount to be paid by
Buyer with respect to the purchase of the Stock and the Units pursuant to this
_Article II_ shall not exceed the Aggregate Consideration as finally
determined in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.07 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Sellers Representative, VMG
Tax-Exempt, Buyer and its applicable Affiliates, the Escrow Agent and any
other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any payment under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement such Taxes as it
is required to deduct or withhold with respect to the making of such payment
or any other Tax withholding obligation with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
deducted, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

corporation to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the character or location of the property owned, leased or operated by it or
the nature of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not or
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except for HSR Clearance, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Voyage Holdings do not require any
consent or approval of any Governmental Authority, except for consents or
approvals the failure of which to obtain would not reasonably be expected to

the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of Voyage Holdings
Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable, free and clear of

Section 3.07 _Financial Statements; Books and Records_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 3.07(a)_ sets forth: (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet

equityholders equity and cash flow for the five (5)-month period ended on
such date (the " _Unaudited Financial Statements_ " and, collectively with the
Audited Financial Statements, the " _Financial Statements_ "). The Financial

LLC and its Subsidiaries, which have been made available to Buyer, and are, in
all material respects, true, correct and complete and have been maintained in

Statements, represent in all material respects bona fide claims against
debtors for sales, services performed or other charges. Said notes and
accounts receivable are subject to no material defenses, counterclaims or
rights of setoff and are fully collectible in the Ordinary Course of Business
without material cost to Quest Nutrition, LLC or resort to material litigation

or kind whatsoever, other than the equity interests described in the foregoing

this Agreement, the business of Voyage Holdings and its Subsidiaries has been
conducted in the Ordinary Course of Business in all material respects and
there has not been any Material Adverse Effect, or any event or events that

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the

(a) Voyage Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries is and for the past three (3)
years has been in compliance in all material respects with all Laws applicable
to Voyage Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries and to the ownership and
operation of its assets and business, including such Laws that require it to
possess permits, licenses, registrations and authorizations of Governmental
Authorities for the current operation of its business. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.09(a)_ , none of Voyage Holding or its Subsidiaries products
being manufactured, assembled (other than the manufacture or assembly in
connection with research and development), sold, leased or delivered by Voyage
Holdings or its Subsidiaries requires, at the date of this Agreement, any
approval of or Permit by any Governmental Authority for the purpose for which
they are being manufactured, assembled, sold, leased or delivered and

 



     

 

 



 

which approval has not been obtained, which, if Voyage Holdings or its
Subsidiaries failed to obtain would not be material to Voyage Holdings and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Voyage Holdings and its Subsidiaries holds and is in compliance in all
material respects with all permits, licenses, approvals, consents,
accreditations, waivers, exemptions and authorizations of any Governmental
Authority that are material to Voyage Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a

business under applicable Laws, and all of which material Permits are set
forth on _Schedule 3.09(b)_. All of such Permits are valid and in full force
and effect and none of such Permits will be terminated as a result of, or in
connection with, the consummation of the Transactions. Neither Voyage Holdings
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material default under any such Permit and
no condition exists that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a material default under such Permit, and there is no Action
pending or, to Voyage Holdings Knowledge, threatened, that would result in
the termination, revocation, suspension or the imposition of a material
restriction on any such Permit or the imposition of any material fine, penalty
or other sanction for violation of any such Permit.

interests.

real property leased or subleased by Voyage Holdings and each of its
Subsidiaries (each, a " _Leased Real Property_ ") and lists all Lease
documents, including any amendment, extension and/or renewal, relating
thereto. With respect to each parcel of Leased Real Property, except as would
not be material to Voyage Holdings or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole:

 



 

(i) all Leases are legal, valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and
effect (except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights generally or by general equitable principles) and Voyage Holdings or
its Subsidiaries hold a valid and existing leasehold or subleasehold interest
under each Lease;

 



 

(ii) none of Voyage Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or
default in any material respect under any Lease, and, to the Knowledge of

Section 6.01 _Organization of Buyer_. Buyer is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of New York.

 



 

Section 6.02 _Authorization of Transaction; Binding Effect_.

 



 

(a) Buyer has full organizational power and authority to carry on its business
as is presently conducted, to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Buyer and the performance by Buyer of its obligations hereunder
have been duly authorized by all requisite organizational action.

 



 

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer and
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable in
accordance with its terms and conditions (except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally or by general equitable principles).

 



 

Section 6.03 _Noncontravention_. Except for the HSR Clearance, neither the
execution and the delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, will (i) violate any provision of the
organizational documents of Buyer, (ii) assuming compliance by Voyage Holdings
with _Section 3.03_ (Noncontravention), by VMG Blocker with _Section 4.03_
(Noncontravention) and by the Sellers with _Section 5.03_ (Noncontravention),

Authority to which Buyer is subject or (iii) conflict with, result in a breach
of, constitute a default under or result in the acceleration of, any contract
to which Buyer is a party or by which its assets are bound, except, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii), where the violation, conflict, breach, default
or acceleration would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on Buyers ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents on or prior to the Outside Date. Except for the HSR
Clearance, to the knowledge of Buyer, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Buyer do not require any consent or approval of any Governmental
Authority.

 



 

Section 6.04 _Broker s Fees_. Buyer has no Liability or obligation to pay any
fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents
to which it is a party for which the Target Companies (prior to the Closing)
or the Sellers could become liable or obligated.

 



 

Section 6.05 _Financing_. Buyer has delivered to the Target Companies,
Sellers Representative and the VMG Sellers a true and complete copy of a debt
commitment letter, dated and as in effect as of the date hereof, between each
of Barclays Bank PLC and the other banks party thereto and Buyer (the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ ") regarding the amounts set forth therein for the purposes
of financing the transactions contemplated hereby and related fees and
expenses, and the related fee letters (in a customarily redacted form) and any
related exhibits, annexes and schedules (such financing, the " _Debt
Financing_ "). There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements to which Buyer is a party which are related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the Debt Financing that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the availability of the Debt Financing other than
as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the Debt
Financing is funded in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter
and the accuracy in all material respects of the Target Companies and
Sellers representations and warranties hereunder, as of the date hereof the
aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the Debt Financing, together
with all other sources of immediately available funds of Buyer, will be
sufficient to allow Buyer to (x) make the Closing Payment, and (y) satisfy all
other obligations of Buyer hereunder required to be paid in cash, including
all related fees and expenses in connection with this Agreement on the Closing
Date. The obligations of the financing sources to fund the commitments under
the Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to any conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.
Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Debt Commitment Letter to be paid as of the date of this Agreement. As of the
date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter (i) has not been amended or modified,
no such amendment or modification is pending or contemplated as of the date
hereof (except for amendments to add additional financing sources thereto or
pursuant to potential market flex terms or as otherwise permitted by the terms
of this Agreement), (ii) has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in
any respect and (iii) is in full force and effect, constitute the legal, valid
and binding obligations of Buyer and, to Buyers knowledge, the other parties
thereto, in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by (x) applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally from time to time in effect, and
(y) the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies and general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). Assuming
the accuracy of the Target Companies and Sellers representations and
warranties hereunder, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part of Buyer or to the knowledge of Buyer, any other parties thereto,
under the Debt Commitment Letter, or a failure of any condition to the Debt
Financing or otherwise result in any portion of the Debt Financing being
unavailable on the Closing Date. Buyer acknowledges that it is not a condition
precedent to Closing that Buyer obtain financing pursuant to any or all of the
Debt Financing or from any other source for or related to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Outside Date.

state or foreign securities Laws or pursuant to an exemption from registration
under the Securities Act and any applicable state or foreign securities Laws.
Buyer will not transfer or otherwise dispose any of the Stock or Units
acquired hereunder or any interest therein in any manner that may cause Buyer
to be in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state or foreign
securities Laws.

 



 

Section 6.08 _Assets and Operations_. Substantially all of the assets
reflected in the balance sheet included in the filings with the SEC of SMPL
are owned by Buyer and Buyers direct or indirect Subsidiaries.

access to the key employees, documents and facilities of the Target Companies
and its Subsidiaries (if any) as Buyer, in its sole discretion, has determined
to be necessary or desirable for purposes of Buyers evaluation, negotiation
and implementation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Target
Companies, their Subsidiaries, the Sellers and their Representatives have
answered to Buyers satisfaction all inquiries that Buyer or its
Representatives have made concerning the business of the Target Companies and
their Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Buyer agrees that, at the Closing, it shall accept the Stock and Units
and the Target Companies and their Subsidiaries in the condition they are in
based upon Buyers own inspection, examination and determination with respect
thereto as to all matters, and without reliance upon any express or implied
representations or warranties of any nature, whether in writing, orally or
otherwise, made by or on behalf of or imputed to the Target Companies, their
Subsidiaries or the Sellers, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement
or any certificate delivered by such Persons hereunder. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that none of the Target
Companies, their Subsidiaries nor the Sellers make any representation or
warranty with respect to (a) any projections, forward-looking estimates or
budgets delivered to or made available to Buyer of future revenues, future
results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Target Companies or
their

 



     

 

 



 

Subsidiaries, or the future business and operations of the Target Companies or
their Subsidiaries, or (b) any other information or documents made available
to Buyer or its counsel, accountants or advisors with respect to the Target
Companies or their Subsidiaries, or their business, assets, Liabilities or
operations, in each case, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or
any certificate delivered by such Persons hereunder. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, nothing shall limit or impair any Persons remedies or
rights, or be deemed to be a waiver of, any claims related to Fraud.

WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY CONTAINED IN THIS _Article VI_ (AND ANY CERTIFICATE WITH
RESPECT THERETO DELIVERED HEREUNDER), NEITHER BUYER NOR ANY OTHER PERSON
ACTING ON BEHALF OF BUYER MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY TO THE SELLERS,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

_however_ , that the Target Companies may not waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Sellers Representative or VMG Holdco.

Target Company; and

 



 

(vi) unless otherwise required by a determination of a Governmental Authority
that is final and to the extent there is a "more likely than not" basis under

applicable Affiliate to file all Tax Returns), including timely and properly
making all agreed elections, consistently with the agreements set forth in
this _Section 8.09(d)_ and neither the Sellers nor Buyer shall take any
position (and Buyer shall not allow any Target Company or any of its other
Affiliates to take any position) on any such Tax Return (or during the course

election under Section 6226 of the Code (and any corresponding election

or Buyer shall promptly notify the other Party if it decides to control the
defense or settlement of any Tax claim for a Pre-Closing Tax Period which it

Target Companies and each of their respective Affiliates shall reasonably
cooperate with each other in contesting any applicable Tax claim in accordance
with this _Section 8.09(e)_ and shall keep each other reasonably informed
concerning the progress of proceedings related to Tax claims for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods and Straddle Periods. To the extent that there is any

(a) _Non-Competition_. Each of the individuals set forth on _Schedule 8.10(a)_
(each, a " _Restricted Seller_ "), on behalf of himself and such Restricted
Sellers Affiliates, agrees that (from the Closing Date until the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date) such Restricted Seller shall not, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to not, directly or indirectly, in any manner

Voyage Holdings and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
Restricted Seller may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment,
securities of any Person if such Restricted Seller is not a controlling Person
of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and does not, directly
or indirectly, together with such Restricted Sellers Affiliates, own five
percent (5%) or more of any class of securities of such Person.

 



 

(b) _Non-Solicitation_. Each Restricted Seller agrees that, from the Closing
Date until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, such Restricted
Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to not, directly or

disparaging statements or communications regarding any other Party, any of
their respective services or practices, or any of their respective
Representatives or Affiliates, either orally or in writing, at any time from
and after the date hereof; _provided_ that this covenant is not intended to
restrict any Party from truthfully cooperating in any Action or from enforcing
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Seller Confidentiality Obligations_. From and after the Closing Date
through the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (but with respect to
Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret under applicable Law,
from the Closing Date through the later of the end of the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date and the date that such Confidential
Information is no longer a trade secret under applicable Law), each Seller
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, treat and hold as
strictly confidential and (A) not make available, sell, disclose or otherwise
communicate to any Person any Confidential Information, and (B) refrain from
using any of the Confidential Information (other than for the benefit of Buyer
and its Affiliates, including the Target Companies); _provided_ , that (i)
each Seller shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information strictly
on a need-to-know basis to such Sellers legal, accounting or financial
advisors, provided such Person agrees to be bound by confidentiality
obligations with such Seller obligating such Person to keep such Confidential
Information confidential, (ii) each Seller that is an individual shall be
permitted to disclose Confidential Information to such Sellers spouse,
provided that such spouse is informed of the confidential nature of such
Confidential Information and agrees to keep such Confidential Information
confidential (and such Seller shall be liable for his or her spouses breach
of such confidentiality obligations), and (iii) each VMG Seller and its
Affiliates (excluding portfolio companies) shall be permitted to disclose
Confidential Information to any affiliated private equity, venture capital or
similar funds that directly or indirectly control such VMG Seller or such
Affiliates or any existing and prospective investors in such funds or
successor funds solely if and to the extent (A) such disclosure is made for
the purpose of, and limited to, reasonable financial reporting or bona fide
fundraising activities and (B) such affiliated funds and existing or
prospective investors are bound by confidentiality obligations with the
disclosing VMG Seller or Affiliate of such VMG Seller obligating such Person
to keep such Confidential Information confidential. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that
(1) the VMG Sellers and their Affiliates are engaged in the business of making
investments in a variety of companies at various stages of development (the "
_Investment Business_ "), (2) in the course of carrying on the Investment
Business, employees, officers, managers, and directors of the VMG Sellers and
their Affiliates receive and review confidential and proprietary information
from many sources, invest in many companies, and mentor, advise and otherwise
interact with (including by providing individuals to serve on the boards of)
investee/portfolio companies, (3) the VMG Sellers and their Affiliates shall
not be prohibited from engaging in the Investment Business solely as a result
of the possession of any Confidential Information, and (4) the VMG Sellers
and their respective Affiliates directors, officers, managers or employees
may serve as directors, officers and managers of portfolio companies of
investment funds managed by the VMG Sellers, and Buyer agrees that such
portfolio companies will not be deemed to have received Confidential
Information solely because any such individual serves on the board or is an
officer or managers of such portfolio companies; _provided_ , that such
individuals have not provided any Confidential Information to such portfolio
companies or to any other director, officer, employee or other representative
of such portfolio companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary herein, VMG Sellers and their Affiliates shall not disclose any
Confidential Information to any portfolio company of any VMG Seller or its
Affiliates (including Affiliated investment funds), or use (directly or
indirectly) any Confidential Information for the benefit of any portfolio
company of any VMG Seller or its Affiliates (including Affiliated investment
funds). In the event that any Seller or any of their

 



     

 

 



 

respective Affiliates is requested or required (by oral question or request
for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Seller, as applicable, shall notify Buyer or the Target
Companies promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer or the Target
Companies may seek an appropriate protective order (at its expense) or waive
compliance with the provisions of this _Section 8.10(d)_. If, in the absence
of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, such Seller, as
applicable, or any of its Affiliates is compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any court or tribunal, such party may disclose the Confidential
Information to such court or tribunal; _provided_ that such party shall use
such partys commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and
expense of Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
shall be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to
be disclosed. For the purposes of this _Section 8.10(d)_, " _Confidential
Information_ " means all information of a confidential or proprietary nature
(whether or not specifically labeled or identified as "confidential"), in any
form or medium, that relates to the business, assets, products, services
and/or research and development of Voyage Holdings, its Subsidiaries and/or
their respective suppliers, distributors, customers, independent contractors
and/or other business relations. Confidential Information includes, but is not
limited to, the following: (i) internal business information (including
historical and projected financial information and budgets and information
relating to strategic and staffing plans and practices, business, training,
marketing, promotional and sales plans and practices, cost, rate and pricing
structures and accounting and business methods); (ii) identities of,
individual requirements of, specific contractual arrangements with, and
information about, suppliers, distributors, customers, independent contractors
or other business relations and their confidential information; (iii) trade
secrets, source code and methods of operation relating to Voyage Holdings and
its Subsidiaries products or services or business, know how, compilations of
data and analyses, techniques, systems, formulae, research, records, reports,
manuals, documentation, models, data and data bases relating thereto; and (iv)
inventions, innovations, improvements, developments, methods, designs,
analyses, drawings, reports and all similar or related information (whether or
not patentable).

 



 

(e) _Buyer Confidentiality Obligations_. From and after the Closing Date
through the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, treat and hold as strictly confidential and (A)
not make available, sell, disclose or otherwise communicate to any Person any
Seller Confidential Information, and (B) refrain from using any of the Seller
Confidential Information (other than for the benefit of such Seller and its
Affiliates), without the prior written consent of the applicable Seller. In
the event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates is requested or required (by
oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to
disclose any Seller Confidential Information, Buyer, as applicable, shall
notify the applicable Seller promptly of the request or requirement so that
such Seller may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with
the provisions of this _Section 8.10(e)_. If, in the absence of a protective
order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Buyer, as applicable, or any of
its Affiliates is compelled to disclose any Seller Confidential Information to
any court or tribunal, such party may disclose the Confidential Information to
such court or tribunal; _provided_ that such party shall use such partys
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and expense of such
Seller, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed. For the purposes of this _Section 8.10(e)_, " _Seller Confidential
Information_ " means all information of a confidential or proprietary and non-
public nature (whether or not specifically labeled or identified as
"confidential"), in any form or medium, that relates to any Seller or their
Affiliates (excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the Target Companies and
their Subsidiaries) obtained by Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with or
a result of the preparation, negotiation or execution of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(f) _Enforcement_. If, at the time of enforcement of _Section 8.10(a)_,
_Section 8.10(b)_, _Section 8.10(c)_, _Section 8.10(d)_ or _Section
8.10(e)_, a court holds that the restrictions stated therein are

 



      

 

 



 

unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the Parties agree that the
maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances
shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court
shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained therein to cover the
maximum period, scope and area permitted by Law. Because each Seller has had
access to confidential, non-public or proprietary information and materials
regarding Voyage Holdings and its Subsidiaries by virtue of its investment in
and involvement with (and as, applicable, employment by) Voyage Holdings and
its Subsidiaries, the Parties agree that (i) Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Target Companies) may suffer
irreparable harm from a breach of _Section 8.10(a)_, _Section 8.10(b)_,
_Section 8.10(c)_ or _Section 8.10(d)_, by such Seller or its Affiliates and
(ii) the Sellers and their Affiliates may suffer irreparable harm from a
breach of _Section 8.10(c)_ or _Section 8.10(e)_ and that, in each case,
money damages might not be an adequate remedy for any such breach of this

of the fee letter or to appoint additional agents, co-agents, arrangers,
bookrunners, managers, initial lenders, or other roles in connection with the

supplement or other modification to the Debt Commitment Letter would (i)

(c) by Buyer, if there has been a material breach or failure to perform on the

agreed that Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.01(c)_ if such breach or failure is cured within such twenty (20) day

Agreement such that the Sellers Representative or VMG Sellers would be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)_;

 



 

(d) by any of the Sellers Representative or VMG Sellers, on the one hand, or
Buyer, on the other hand, if a Governmental Authority shall have issued a
nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any other action having
the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the

_provided_ , that none of the Sellers Representative or the VMG Sellers shall
be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(e)_
if any Sellers or any Target Companys breach of this Agreement has been the
principal cause of the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to have
been consummated by the Outside Date and (ii) Buyer shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(e)_ if Buyers
breach of this Agreement has been the principal cause of the failure of the

forth in this _Article XI_:

 



 

(a) Each Seller shall, on a several but not joint basis, indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and each of its Representatives (each, a " _Buyer Indemnified
Party_ ") against and in respect of any and all any and all claims, losses,
Liabilities, costs, expenses and damages, (" _Damages_ ") resulting from:

 



 

(i) the breach by such Seller of any covenant or agreement to be performed by
it under this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) the breach by such Seller of any representation or warranty contained in
_Section 5.04_ (Ownership of Stock and Units).

 



 

(b) Each Quest Seller (other than the holders of Class M Units) shall, on a
several but not joint basis (pro rata based upon such Quest Sellers Founder
Proceeds Percentage), indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Parties against and in respect of any and all Damages resulting from (i) the
breach by Voyage Holdings of any covenant or agreement to be performed by
Voyage Holdings under this Agreement on or prior to the Closing, (ii) the
breach by Voyage Holdings of any representation or warranty contained in
_Section 3.04_ (Capitalization) or _Section 3.20_ (Affiliate Transactions),
or (iii) any claim by a Seller or former equityholder of the Target Companies,
or any other Person, based upon the allocation and payment to such Seller of
the Aggregate Consideration paid by Buyer pursuant to the Allocation Schedule.

 



 

(c) Each VMG Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Parties against and in respect of any and all Damages resulting from the
breach by such VMG Seller of any covenant or agreement to be performed by it
under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) VMG Tax-Exempt shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Parties against and in respect of any and all Damages resulting from (i) the
breach by VMG Blocker of any covenant or agreement to be performed by VMG
Blocker under this Agreement on or prior to the Closing or (ii) the breach by
VMG Blocker of any representation or warranty contained in _Section 4.04_
(Capitalization).

 



 

(e) Any Damages payable by any Seller pursuant to this _Section 11.02_ shall
solely be paid directly by such Seller; _provided_ that no Seller shall be
liable for Damages under this _Article XI_ or any other provision of this
Agreement in excess of the total proceeds received by such Seller pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.03 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers and their respective Representatives against and in
respect of any and all Damages resulting from (i) the breach by Buyer of any
representation or warranty made by Buyer in ARTICLE VI (Representations and
Warranties of Buyer), (ii) the breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement to
be performed by it hereunder and/or (iii) the breach by any Target Company of
any covenant or agreement to be performed by it after the Closing hereunder.

Quest Seller in accordance with such Quest Sellers Percentage Allocation
after giving effect to any payment to the VMG Sellers pursuant to clause (B),
and (B) the VMG Sellers shall be paid to the VMG Sellers such that the VMG
Sellers shall have at all times received the VMG Exit Payment (without any

Section 11.04 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

 



     

 

 



 

(a) _Indemnity Cap_. The aggregate Liability of the (i) Quest Sellers pursuant
to _Article XI_ (Indemnification), including for Damages based on Fraud,
shall not exceed the Aggregate Consideration, as may be adjusted post-Closing
as provided herein, payable to the Quest Sellers and (ii) the VMG Sellers
pursuant to _Article XI_ (Indemnification), including for Damages based on
Fraud, shall not exceed the Closing Consideration, as may be adjusted post-
Closing as provided herein, payable to the VMG Sellers (each an " _Indemnity
Cap_ "). Subject to _Section 11.02(b)_ and _Section 11.02(e)_
(Indemnification by the Sellers), the aggregate Liability of each individual
Seller, including for Damages based on Fraud, will not exceed its Percentage
Allocation __multiplied by__ the applicable Indemnity Cap. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that, except for claims for Damages based on Fraud, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties sole recourse following the Closing in respect of
claims for breaches of or inaccuracies in representations and warranties
(other than with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 3.04_ (Capitalization), _Section 3.20_ (Affiliate Transactions),
_Section 4.04_ (Capitalization) and _Section 5.04_ (Ownership of Stock and
Units)) shall be under the RandW Insurance Policy and not under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The indemnification obligations of the Quest Sellers (other than the
holders of Class M Units) under _Section 11.02(b)(ii)_ shall be determined as
follows (which obligations shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be several and
not joint as to each such Quest Seller pro rata based upon such Quest Sellers
Founder Proceeds Percentage):

 



 

(i) the Quest Sellers (other than the holders of Class M Units) shall be
obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties until the aggregate
Damages of the Buyer Indemnified Parties from breaches of any representation
or warranty contained in _Section 3.04_ or _Section 3.20_ until such Damages
equal $3,750,000;

 



 

(ii) thereafter, the Quest Sellers (other than the holders of Class M Units)
shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties until the
aggregate Damages of the Buyer Indemnified Parties from breaches of any
representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.04_ or _Section 3.20_
(when taken together with all other Damages sustained by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to _Section 11.02(b)(ii)_) are in excess of $3,750,000 and
less than or equal to $103,750,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Quest
Sellers shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties to
the extent that such Damagers have been actually recovered by Buyer under the
RandW Insurance Policy; and

 



 

(iii) thereafter, the Quest Sellers (other than the holders of Class M Units)
shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for aggregate
Damages resulting from breaches of any representation or warranty contained in
_Section 3.04_ that are (when taken together with all other Damages sustained
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 11.02(b)(ii)_) in
excess of $103,750,000 until the applicable Indemnity Cap has been reached
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 11.04(b)(iii)_ shall not
apply to breaches of any representation or warranty contained in _Section
3.20_, and the Quest Sellers obligations to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any such breaches shall be limited to the amount set forth in
_Section 11.04(b)(i)_).

 



 

(c) Each Person providing indemnification pursuant to this _Article XI_ is
also referred to herein as an " _Indemnifying Party_ ," and each Person being
indemnified pursuant to this _Article XI_ is also referred to herein as an "
_Indemnified Party_." For purposes of determining the Liability of any
Indemnifying Party under this _Article XI_ for any Damages, appropriate
reductions shall be made to reflect (i) the present value, as of the date
payment is made, of the Tax benefits, if any (determined after taking into
account any Tax detriment arising from indemnification hereunder) actually
realized (determined on a "with or without" basis and after first taking into
account all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of such
Indemnified Party or group) in the taxable year in which the Damages arose or
the immediately succeeding taxable year by the Indemnified Party (or any
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Indemnified Party is also
a member) attributable to (A) the incurrence or payment of such Damage and (B)

 



     

 

 



 

a correlative adjustment that makes allowable to the Indemnified Party any
deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance and (ii) the
recovery pursuant to any insurance policy received or that is reasonably
expected to be received by any Indemnified Party in respect of such Damages.
If an indemnification payment is received by any Indemnified Party, and such
Indemnified Party later recognizes insurance recoveries or such Tax benefits,
as described in the immediately preceding sentence, in respect of the related
Damages or indemnification payments that were not previously accounted for
with respect to such Damages or indemnification payments when made, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, and promptly,
but in any event no later than five (5) days after delivery of such notice by
such Indemnified Party, pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the
lesser of (A) any such insurance recoveries and such Tax benefits and (B) the
actual amount of the indemnification payments previously paid by the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Damages.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
of Fraud by (i) a Seller, only such Seller (and not any other Seller) shall be
liable for any Damages payable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect
thereof, (ii) Voyage Holdings, each Quest Seller (other than the Holders of
Class M Units) shall be liable severally and not jointly for its portion of
such Damages (pro rata based upon such Quest Sellers Founder Proceeds
Percentage) to the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect thereof, and (iii) VMG
Blocker, VMG Tax-Exempt shall be liable for the Damages payable to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in respect thereof, except, in each case (i) through
(iii), that no Seller shall be liable for Damages under this _Article XI_ or
any other provision of this Agreement in excess of the total proceeds received
by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.05 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, each Party
acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and
transactions contemplated hereby (other than Actions for equitable or
injunctive relief and _Section 2.06_ or arising from or related to Fraud (but
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article XI_)) shall be pursuant
to the indemnification set forth in this _Article XI_. In furtherance of the
foregoing, but without limiting the rights of indemnification expressly
provided for under _Section 11.02_ (Indemnification by the Sellers) and
_Section 11.03_ (Indemnification by Buyer) (and subject to the other
provisions of this _Article XI_), each Indemnified Party hereby waives, from
and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
any and all rights, claims and causes of action (including any right, whether
arising at Law or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution, cost
recovery, damages or any other recourse or remedy, including the remedy of
rescission and remedies that may arise under common law) it may have against
any Indemnifying Party whether arising under or based upon any federal, state,
local or foreign Law (including any Environmental Requirement) or otherwise.

 



 

Section 11.06 _Procedures for Third-Party Claims_. In the event that an
Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for Damages against an
Indemnifying Party arising from a claim of a third party (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of
the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , that failure to give such notification on
a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced as
a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Indemnifying Party from time to time, promptly, but in any event within
five (5) days of becoming aware of any facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to, or be in furtherance of, a claim for
indemnification hereunder, written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party,
specifying the amount of such claim, the nature and basis of such claim and
all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto, including copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim and, if it
elects, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party. Should an Indemnifying Party elect to assume the defense

 



     

 

 



 

of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying
Party shall control such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the
defense of any Third-Party Claim if (i) the Third-Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal Action or allegations, (ii) the Third-
Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is
failing to prosecute or defend the Third-Party Claim vigorously; (iv) the
estimated potential Damages (as reasonably determined by the Indemnified
Party) would exceed the applicable Indemnity Cap(s) or (v) such claim involves
a Governmental Authority or any customer of Voyage Holdings or its
Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 3.22_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article XI_, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for
any period during which the Indemnifying Party has elected not to assume the
defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend a Third-Party
Claim, each Party shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of
such Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision by the Indemnified Party to
the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making personnel available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. No compromise or settlement of any Third-
Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Partys consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; _provided_ that no such consent shall be required if (a) there is
no finding or admission of any violation of Law by the Indemnified Party or of
fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
and no effect on any other claims that may be made against such Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates, (b) the sole relief is monetary damages that are paid
in full by the Indemnifying Party and (c) each Indemnified Party that is party
to such Third-Party Claim is fully and unconditionally released from Liability
with respect to such claim. No Indemnified Party shall settle or compromise
any Third-Party Claim without the express prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
_provided_ that it shall be reasonable for the Indemnifying Party to withhold
any such consent if such settlement or compromise creates any Liability or
obligation on the part of such Indemnifying Party or otherwise affects any
claims that are then pending or threatened, or may be made, against such
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

Section 11.07 _Procedures for Inter-Party Claims_. In the event that an
Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for Damages against an
Indemnifying Party hereunder (other than as a result of a Third-Party Claim),
the Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party, specifying the amount of such claim, the nature and basis
of the alleged breach giving rise to such claim and all relevant facts and
circumstances relating thereto. The Indemnified Party shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with full access to its books and records during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior written notice for the purpose of
allowing the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to verify any such
claim for Damages and shall make its personnel available on a mutually
convenient basis, and at no additional expense to the Indemnifying Party, to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party within
forty-five (45) days following its receipt of such notice and granting of such
access if the Indemnifying Party disputes its Liability to the Indemnified
Party under this _Article XI_. If the Indemnifying Party does not so notify
the Indemnified Party, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such
notice shall be conclusively deemed to be a Liability of the Indemnifying
Party under this _Article XI_, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the
amount of such Liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of
any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion
of such claim) becomes finally determined. If the

 



     

 

 



 

Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its Liability with respect to such
claim as provided above, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. Following the final
determination of the amount of Damages to which the Indemnified Party is
entitled (whether determined in accordance with this _Section 11.07_ or by
arbitration), the Indemnifying Party shall pay such Damages to the Indemnified
Party by wire transfer or certified check made payable to the order of the
Indemnified Party.

 



 

Section 11.08 _Mitigation; Insurance; Subrogation_. Each Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts (determined without regard to any
indemnification or escrow recovery rights, as applicable, of such Person
hereunder ( _i.e._ , as if such Person had no such rights hereunder)) to
mitigate any Damage for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnified
Party shall be required to pursue, or otherwise take any legal actions related
to, any third party collateral sources (other than any insurance policy
(including the RandW Insurance Policy) or institute any legal proceedings
against a third party in connection with such efforts. If any Damages
sustained by an Indemnified Party may be covered by an insurance policy
(including the RandW Insurance Policy) or an indemnification, contribution or
similar obligation of another Person (other than an Affiliate of such
Indemnified Party), the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or
similar payments. The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification under
_Section 11.02_ (Indemnification by the Sellers) or _Section 11.03_
(Indemnification by Buyer) shall be reduced by the amounts recovered by the
applicable Indemnified Party, as applicable, under applicable insurance
policies (including the RandW Insurance Policy) or an indemnification,
contribution or similar obligation of another Person (other than an Affiliate
of such Indemnified Party) with respect to claims related to such Damages and
if any Indemnified Party receives such insurance proceeds or indemnity,
contribution or similar payments after the settlement of any indemnification
claim under _Section 11.02_ (Indemnification by the Sellers) or _Section
11.03_ (Indemnification by Buyer), as applicable, such Indemnified Party shall
refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such insurance proceeds or
indemnity, contribution or similar payments, up to the amount received in
connection with such indemnification claim. It is the intention of the Parties
that no insurer or third party shall be entitled to any benefit or right it
would not be entitled to receive in the absence of this paragraph. Each Party
hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its applicable insurance
policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with respect to any
indemnifiable Damages.

 



 

Section 11.09 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Following the Closing, any
payment made pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be treated by the Parties
hereunder as an adjustment to the cash proceeds received by the Sellers in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 12.01 _Sellers  Representative_.

 



 

(a) Each Quest Seller, by virtue of its execution and delivery of this
Agreement, hereby irrevocably nominates, constitutes and appoints the Sellers

any or all of the Quest Sellers or otherwise) any and all documents, including
the Escrow Agreement, and to take any and all actions that the Sellers

desirable or appropriate in connection with any matter covered in _Section
2.06_ (Post-Closing Adjustment) or any indemnification claim under

 



     

 

 



 

 _Article XI_ (Indemnification) (including negotiating, entering into
compromises or settlements of and demanding arbitration with respect to any
such matters covered in _Section 2.06_ (Post-Closing Adjustment) or any
indemnification claim, as applicable); and (ii) give and receive notices and
communications under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Sellers

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Buyer shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Sellers Representative
on all matters relating to _Section 2.06_ (Post-Closing Adjustment), the
Escrow Agreement, and each Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to deal
exclusively with the Sellers Representative on all matters relating to
_Article XI_ (Indemnification), and each of them shall be entitled to rely
conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document
executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Quest Seller by the
Sellers Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be
taken on behalf of any Quest Seller by the Sellers Representative, as fully
binding upon such Seller.

 



 

(d) The Sellers Representative may at any time designate a replacement
Sellers Representative and each Quest Seller, by virtue of his, her or its
execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby consents to such replacement
Sellers Representative. If the Sellers Representative shall dissolve or
liquidate or otherwise become unable to fulfill its responsibilities as
representative of the Quest Sellers, then the Quest Sellers shall, by
"majority vote" within thirty (30) days after such dissolution, liquidation or
other event, appoint a successor representative and, promptly thereafter,
shall notify Buyer of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall
become the "Sellers Representative" for purposes of this Agreement. If for
any reason there is no Sellers Representative at any time, all references
herein to the Sellers Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Quest
Sellers.

 



 

(e) No bond shall be required of the Sellers Representative, and the Sellers
Representative shall receive no compensation for its services. The Sellers
Representative shall not be liable to any Quest Seller for any act done or
omitted hereunder as the Sellers Representative while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment with respect to any
matter arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration
of its duties hereunder (it being understood that any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith). The Sellers Representative shall be entitled to be indemnified by the
Quest Sellers, on a several but not joint basis, for any loss, Liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
the Sellers Representative with respect to any matter arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder. The
Quest Sellers agree to set aside $1,000,000 (" _Quest Sellers  Holdback_") of
proceeds to pay for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
Sellers Representative in good faith and in connection with actions taken by
the Sellers Representative pursuant to this Agreement (including the hiring
of legal counsel and the incurring of legal fees and costs). The Sellers
Representative shall keep reasonably detailed records of the reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses of Sellers Representative for serving in such
capacity and to the extent such costs and expenses do not exceed the Quest
Sellers Holdback, then Sellers Representative shall return the remaining
funds to the Quest Sellers (pro rata in accordance with their respective
Percentage Allocations) within a reasonable period of time after which
Sellers Representative believes in good faith it will no longer incur such
fees and expenses.

 



     

 

 



 

(f) Prior to the Closing, any act of the Sellers Representative shall require
the unanimous written consent of both Michael Osborn and Ron Penna. Following
the Closing any act of the Sellers Representative shall require the written
consent of either Michael Osborn or Ron Penna.

 



 

Section 12.02 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section
8.07_ (Directors and Officers Indemnification), _Section 11.02_
(Indemnification by the Sellers) and _Section 11.03_ (Indemnification by
Buyer), each of which is expressly intended for the benefit of the Persons
referenced therein, this Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer
any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that
the Debt Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section 12.02_, _Section 12.09(b)_, _Section 12.09(c)_, _Section
12.10(b), Section 12.11_ and _Section 12.17_ and each of such Sections shall
expressly inure to the benefit of the Debt Financing Sources, and the Debt
Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of
such Sections.

 



 

Section 12.03 _Equitable Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, prior to the Closing with respect to all provisions of this
Agreement and from and after the Closing with respect to _Section 8.02_
(Press Releases), _Section 8.04_ (Confidentiality), _Section 8.08_ (Post-
Closing Record Retention and Access) and _Section 8.10_ (Non-Competition;
Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement), the Target Companies and the Sellers, on
the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, hereby agree that in the event any
of the Target Companies or the Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand violate any provisions of this Agreement, the remedies at Law
available to Buyer, on the one hand, and the Target Companies and the Sellers,
on the other hand, may be inadequate. In such event, the Target Companies and
the Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall have the
right, in addition to all other rights and remedies they may have, to specific
performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce or prevent
any violations by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Target Companies or the
Sellers, on the other hand.

 



 

Section 12.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits and
Schedules (including Disclosure Schedules), and the documents referred to
herein constitute the entire agreement among the Parties and supersede any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, that may have related in any way to the subject matter
hereof.

 



 

Section 12.05 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned (i) by
any Party other than Buyer without the prior written consent of Buyer or (ii)
by Buyer without the written consent of the Sellers Representative and the
VMG Sellers, and any attempted assignment without such prior written consent
shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may, without any such
prior written consent, assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations
hereunder to any of its Affiliates or to any of its financing sources as
collateral security, provided that such assignment shall not relieve Buyer of
any of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any
amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of digital
imaging and electronic mail or a facsimile machine, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person.

 



 

Section 12.07 _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the

affected. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder or affect in any way any rights

mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Party.

legal counsel) incurred by the prevailing party in connection with enforcing
its rights or defending claims hereunder. In the event of any legal dispute or
Action arising out of this Agreement, each party to such Action shall bear its

except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law), and all costs and
expenses of the arbitration proceeding (such as filing fees, the arbitrators
