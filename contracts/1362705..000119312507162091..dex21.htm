(v) Seller shall cause the Company to pay and deposit the sum of $8,500,000,
with the Escrow Agent, to fund a drilling fund escrow immediately prior to
Closing (the " _Drilling Fund Escrow_ "), to be used by CEPCB, post-Closing,
in connection with CEPCBs post-Closing, drilling, development and operation
of CEPCBs assets and properties, in the manner that CEPCB believes is in the
interest of CEPCB. Seller shall pay the Drilling Fund Escrow, on behalf of the
Company, by directing that a portion of the Earnest Money Deposit otherwise

the Seller Escrow Fund in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the
account specified in the Escrow Agreement; and

(ii) to the Seller: the Cash Payment in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account specified at least two (2) Business Days prior to the

\- 4 - (c) _Release of Earnest Money Deposit_. At Closing, the Earnest Money Deposit
shall be released to Seller (except with regard to the portion to be directed

2.4(a)(v)_ above) in accordance with Sections 2.3(c) or 9.2(a) hereof.

Section 2.5 _Transfer Taxes and Recording Fees_.

All sales, transfer (including, without limitation, real estate transfer
Taxes), recording, deed, stamp, registration, documentary, conveyancing,
franchise, property, notarial, grantor or grantee Taxes (but not including
any Income Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") in connection with the effectuation
of the Merger shall be paid by CEPCB, whether imposed on CEPCB or Seller or
the Company. The parties shall cooperate to comply with all Tax
Return requirements for such Taxes contemplated by this _Section 2.5_ and
shall provide such documentation and take such other actions as may be
necessary to minimize the amount of any such Taxes.

Section 2.6 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

(a) For purposes hereof, " _Net Working Capital_ " shall mean the amount that
is the difference between (i) the book value of the Companys Current Assets,
and (ii) the book value of the Companys Current Liabilities, in each case
calculated on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP after giving effect
to the Pre-Closing Transactions. " _Current Assets_ " as used in the
definition of Net Working Capital shall mean all current assets of the
Company on a consolidated basis, including, without limitation, all cash and
cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable (net of
allowance for doubtful accounts), parts inventory, Inter-Company Balances
(as appropriate) accruing from July 1 through the Closing Date, prepaid
expenses and other receivables and assets, but specifically excluding any
Income Taxes (current or deferred) and the Drilling Fund Escrow. "
_Current Liabilities_ " as used in the definition of Net Working Capital
shall mean all current liabilities of the Company on a consolidated basis
(including, without limitation, all accounts payable, accrued expenses and
Inter-Company Balances (as appropriate) accruing from July 1 through the
Closing Date, but specifically excluding any Income Taxes (current or
deferred) and any potential obligations under the Osage Plan and the
Separation Benefit Agreements listed on _Schedule 6.6(a)_.

(b) No less than two but no more than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall cause to be prepared and delivered to CEPCB the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of the month
immediately preceding the Closing Date (or, if the Closing Date occurs during
the first 10 Business Days of a month, as of the end of the month preceding
the month immediately preceding the Closing Date) (the " _Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet_ "), as well as a good faith estimate, based on a roll-forward
of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, of the Net Working Capital of
the Company as of the Closing Date, which estimate shall be reasonably
acceptable to CEPCB (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ "). Seller
shall grant CEPCB full access during normal business hours to the books and
records and personnel of Seller and the Transferred Companies and the
opportunity to consult with Seller for purposes of confirming or disputing the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount. If Sellers estimate of the Net Working
Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date is not reasonably acceptable to
CEPCB and the parties are unable to otherwise mutually agree on such amount,
then the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount shall be the mean average of
Sellers  



 

\- 5 -  estimate of such amount (as delivered to CEPCB with the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet) and CEPCBs good faith estimate of such amount. The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except for the absence of notes and normal recurring year-end adjustments
(which shall not be material individually or in the aggregate)) and in a
manner consistent with the Financial Statements. To the extent that the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is less than the Required Net Working
Capital Amount, then the Purchase Price payable by CEPCB at the Closing shall
be decreased by such shortfall. To the extent that the Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount is greater than the Required Net Working Capital Amount, then
the Purchase Price payable by CEPCB at the Closing shall be increased by such
surplus.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date (but in no event later
than 60 days following the Closing Date), CEPCB shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Seller a draft unaudited consolidated balance sheet
of the Company as of the Effective Time (the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_
") which shall include a calculation of the actual Net Working Capital of the
Company as of the Effective Time. The Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for the absence of notes and normal
recurring year-end adjustments (which shall not be material individually or in
the aggregate)) and in a manner consistent with the Financial Statements.

(d) If Seller has no objections to CEPCBs draft of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet (or fails to deliver a detailed statement of its objections in
accordance with the following sentence), such draft shall be the Final Closing
Balance Sheet. If Seller has any objections to CEPCBs draft of the Final
Closing Balance Sheet, Seller shall deliver a detailed statement (" _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") describing Sellers objections to CEPCB within 30 days
after receiving the draft Final Closing Balance Sheet. CEPCB and Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections. If a
final resolution is not obtained within 30 days after CEPCB has received the
Notice of Disagreement, CEPCB and Seller shall select a nationally-recognized
accounting firm mutually acceptable to them to resolve any remaining
objections. If CEPCB and Seller are unable to agree on the choice of an
accounting firm, they shall select KPMG LLP. Such accounting firm shall
consider only those items and amounts set forth in CEPCBs draft
Final Closing Balance Sheet or the Notice of Disagreement that remain in
dispute and shall base its determinations solely on the submissions of the
parties and the definitions and other relevant provisions contained herein. In
resolving any disputed item, such accounting firm may not assign a value to
any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party
or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
agreed upon accounting firm shall deliver its final resolution of items
specified in the Notice of Disagreement to the parties in writing, which final
resolution shall be delivered not more than thirty (30) days following the
referral of such disagreement to the selected firm. The decision of such
accounting firm shall be final and binding on all parties hereto. If any
unresolved objections are submitted to an accounting firm for resolution as
provided above, the fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be split
50%/50% between CEPCB and Seller, with Sellers portion to be paid out of the
CEPCB Escrow Fund, or if the remaining amounts in such escrow account are
insufficient, then from any other Escrow Fund accounts.

(e) CEPCB shall revise the draft Final Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Net Working Capital set forth therein as appropriate to
reflect the resolution of Sellers objections (as agreed upon by CEPCB and
Seller or as determined by such selected accounting firm) and deliver it to
Seller within 10 days after the resolution of such objections. Such revised
Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be the Final Closing Balance Sheet for all
purposes hereunder.



 

\- 6 - (f) To the extent that the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time as set
forth in the Final Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Final Net Working Capital
Amount_ ") is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount (the "
_Working Capital Shortfall_ "), CEPCB shall be entitled to recover the Working
Capital Shortfall from the Working Capital Escrow portion of the Escrow Fund
and, to the extent necessary, the Indemnification Escrow portion of the Escrow
Fund, in each case subject to and as set forth in _Section 2.7(b)_.

(g) To the extent that the Final Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount (the " _Working Capital Surplus_ "),
CEPCB shall pay to Seller the Working Capital Surplus by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within two Business Days after CEPCBs delivery of
the Final Closing Balance Sheet to Seller.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a dispute as to the Final Net
Working Capital Amount, Seller or CEPCB, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to receive promptly such amounts as are not in dispute, pending
final determination of such dispute pursuant to this _Section 2.6_.

(i) All amounts paid by any Person pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ shall be
considered an adjustment to the Purchase Price for tax purposes.

Section 2.7 _CEPCB Escrow Fund and Seller Escrow Fund_.

(a) The sum of the amounts set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of the following
sentence (the " _CEPCB Escrow Fund_ ") shall be deposited on the Closing Date
with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
The CEPCB Escrow Fund shall be comprised of two separate and distinct amounts:
(i) an amount equal to $16,000,000 (the " _CEPCB Indemnification Escrow_ ")
shall be used (A) to satisfy Losses, if any, for which the CEPCB Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification or reimbursement in accordance with
_Article X_ hereof, (B) to pay any costs and expenses for which Seller is
responsible under _Sections 2.6(d)_ or _11.11_ of this Agreement or under
_Sections 11(b)_ , _14(d)_ and _15_ of the Escrow Agreement, (C) to pay the
Working Capital Shortfall, if any, described in _Section 2.6_ hereof to the
extent, if any, such shortfall exceeds the Working Capital Escrow, and (D) to
secure CEPCBs obligation to pay Seller that portion of the Adjusted Purchase
Price that Seller did not receive on the Closing Date, which amount shall be
reduced by any payments due to the CEPCB Indemnified Parties pursuant to
clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this sentence, and (ii) $1,500,000 of the CEPCB
Escrow Fund (the " _Working Capital Escrow_ ") shall be used to satisfy the
Working Capital Shortfall, if any, described in _Section 2.6(f)_ hereof.

(b) Promptly following the expiration of the Net Working Capital adjustment
period as set forth in _Section 2.6_ and resolution of all disputes, if any,
regarding the Final Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Final Net Working Capital
Amount, the Working Capital Escrow portion of the CEPCB Escrow Fund shall be
disbursed as follows: (i) if there exists a Working Capital Shortfall, CEPCB
shall be entitled to an amount equal to the Working Capital Shortfall and the
remainder of the Working Capital Escrow portion of the CEPCB Escrow Fund, if
any,  



 

\- 7 -  shall be released to Seller (if and to the extent an equivalent amount is
not otherwise paid by CEPCB to Seller in lieu thereof); _provided, however,_
 if the Working Capital Shortfall exceeds the Working Capital Escrow portion
of the CEPCB Escrow Fund, then CEPCB shall be entitled to the entire Working
Capital Escrow portion of the CEPCB Escrow Fund, as well as a disbursement
from the CEPCB Indemnification Escrow portion of the CEPCB Escrow Fund in an
amount equal to the Working Capital Shortfall less the Working Capital Escrow
(provided that CEPCBs recourse under such circumstances shall be limited to
the entire CEPCB Escrow Fund); and (ii) if there exists a Working Capital
Surplus, the entire Working Capital Escrow portion of the CEPCB Escrow Fund
shall be released to Seller (if and to the extent an equivalent amount is not
otherwise paid by CEPCB to Seller in lieu thereof) and CEPCB shall pay to
Seller the amount of the Working Capital Surplus in accordance with _Section
2.6(g)_.

(c) On the 180th day following the Closing Date (or, if such date is not a
Business Day, the immediately following Business Day) (the " _Early
Distribution Date")_ , the Escrow Agent shall release to Seller from
the CEPCB Indemnification Escrow an amount equal to $12,800,000, less the sum
of (1) any amounts previously paid to CEPBC from and out of the CEPCB
Indemnification Escrow, plus (2) any then existing Withheld CEPCB Amount, if
any (as defined below). On the one-year anniversary date of the Closing Date
(or, if such date is not a Business Day, the immediately following Business
Day), (i) the Escrow Agent shall release the remaining amounts held in the
CEPCB Indemnification Escrow to Seller (if and to the extent an equivalent
amount is not otherwise paid by CEPCB to Seller in lieu thereof), less any
Withheld CEPCB Amount, if any (as defined below), and (ii) such escrow shall
terminate, unless there is any Withheld CEPCB Amount (in which case, the
escrow shall continue until all pending claims are fully resolved and any
remaining amounts held in such escrow are properly distributed in accordance
with the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if on either the Early Distribution Date or the
Indemnification Escrow Termination Date (as defined herein), as the case may
be, any claim by a CEPCB Indemnified Party has been made that could result in
a Loss, and CEPCB has notified the Escrow Agent and Seller of such in
writing, then there shall be withheld from the distribution to Seller such
amount of the CEPCB Indemnification Escrow portion of the CEPCB Escrow Fund
necessary to cover all Losses or other amounts payable to CEPCB pursuant to
_Section 2.7(a)_ hereof potentially resulting from all such pending CEPCB
Claims in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (and such escrow
shall continue with respect to such withheld amount) (the " _Withheld CEPCB
Amount_ "), and the Withheld CEPCB Amount (or the applicable portion thereof)
shall either be (A) paid to CEPCB, or (B) released to Seller (if and to the
extent an equivalent amount is not otherwise paid by CEPCB to Seller in lieu
thereof), as determined upon final resolution of each such claim in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and _Article X_ hereof.

(d) If and to the extent CEPCB pays amounts to Seller in lieu of having
equivalent amounts released from the CEPCB Escrow Fund to Seller, such amounts
of the CEPCB Escrow Fund shall be released to CEPCB.

 

(e) CEPCB shall deposit $1,000,000 (the "Seller Escrow Fund") with the Escrow
Agent on the Closing Date pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The Seller Escrow
Fund shall be used to satisfy Losses, if any, for which the Seller Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification or reimbursement in accordance with
Article X hereof.



 

\- 8 - (f) On the 180th day following the Closing Date (or, if such date is not a
Business Day, the immediately following Business Day), the Escrow Agent shall
release to CEPCB from the Seller Escrow Fund an amount equal to $750,000,
less the sum of (1) any amounts previously paid to Seller from and out of the
Seller Escrow Fund, plus (2) any then existing Withheld Seller Amount, if any
(defined below). On the one-year anniversary date of the Closing Date (or, if
such date is not a Business Day, the immediately following Business Day), (i)
the Escrow Agent shall release to CEPCB the remaining amounts held in the
Seller Escrow Fund, less any Withheld Seller Amount, if any (as defined
below), and (ii) such escrow shall terminate, unless there is any Withheld
Seller Amount (in which case, the escrow shall continue until all pending
claims are fully resolved and any remaining amounts held in such escrow are
properly distributed in accordance with the terms hereof and the Escrow
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on either Indemnification Escrow
Termination Date (as defined herein) any claim by a Seller Indemnified Party
has been made that could result in a Loss and Seller has notified the Escrow
Agent and CEPCB of such in writing, then there shall be withheld from the
distribution to CEPCB such amount of the Seller Escrow Fund necessary to cover
all Losses potentially resulting from all such pending Seller Claims in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (and such escrow shall
continue with respect to such withheld amount) (the " _Withheld Seller Amount_
"), and the Withheld Seller Amount (or the applicable portion thereof) shall
either be (A) paid to Seller, or (B) released to CEPCB, as determined upon
final resolution of each such claim in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and _Article X_ hereof.

 

(g) The Parties agree to provide the Escrow Agent such written notices,
confirmations and directions as are consistent with the terms hereof and
the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

common stock, $1.00 par value per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "). As of
the date hereof, 100 shares of Company Common Stock are issued and
outstanding, all of which are held by Seller. Such shares of Company
Common Stock constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company as of the date hereof. No Subsidiary of the Company owns,

of each Subsidiary of the Company. There are (a) no outstanding options,

the Transferred Companies is a party with respect to the voting

Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ , neither the Company nor any of its

applied during the period presented, except as otherwise noted therein.

(b) Except as disclosed on _Schedules 4.4_ and _4.5_ , neither the Company

Sheet.

(c) The Transferred Companies maintain internal controls over financial
reporting that, to the Knowledge of Seller, provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of

in accordance with GAAP. To the Knowledge of Seller, there are no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of the
Transferred Companies internal controls which could adversely affect the

Seller will execute any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Following the Closing, Seller agrees to promptly (and in no event longer

such consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Authorities necessary to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Agreement shall be made only at such times and in such manner as may be agreed
upon in advance by the parties hereto; _provided, however, _ that (i) any
party hereto shall be entitled to make a public announcement of the foregoing

(a) CEPCB shall assume and retain any and all liabilities and obligations
under COBRA associated with Company Employees, former employees and
their qualified beneficiaries (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code)
regardless of the dates of the qualifying events (as defined in Section
4980B(f) of the Code). CEPCB also acknowledges and agrees that it will make,
or will cause the Transferred Companies to make, all payments to Company
Employees, when and if due under the Osage Plan and any separation benefits
agreements listed on _Schedule 6.6(a)_. Seller shall pay CEPCB, through the
Net Working Capital adjustment, for any benefit paid by CEPCB under an
Employee Benefit Plan that provides medical, hospitalization, dental, vision,
prescription drug or similar benefits to the extent that the expense related
to that benefit was incurred on or before the Closing but reported to such
Employee Benefit Plan after Closing. Such amounts, if any, shall be reflected
as a Current Liability on the Final Closing Balance Sheet. From the Closing
Date until a date no earlier than twelve months after the Closing Date,
CEPCB agrees that it shall provide, or cause the Transferred Companies to
provide, total compensation and benefits to Company Employees that are
substantially equal in the aggregate to the total compensation and benefits
provided to them by or on behalf of the Transferred Companies immediately
prior to the Closing (which shall include eligibility to participate in the
CEPCB welfare plans that provide medical, dental, health, life, disability and
similar benefits as of the Closing Date and the CEPCB 401(k) Plan, as defined
in paragraph (d) below, as soon as practicable after the Closing), and, after
such period, CEPCB agrees that it shall provide, or cause the Transferred
Companies to provide, total compensation and benefits to Company Employees
that are equivalent to similarly situated employees of CEPCB. For all purposes
under the employee benefit plans of CEPCB (the " _CEPCB Plans_ "), each
Company Employee shall receive credit for service with the
Transferred Companies and any predecessor company to the extent that such
Company Employee was entitled to credit under the Employee Benefit Plans and
to the extent that Seller provides CEPCB with the necessary information to
determine such credit. The CEPCB Plans shall recognize for purposes of
eligibility to participate, early retirement and eligibility for vesting,
service by each Company Employee with any Transferred Company or its
Affiliate. With respect to each Company Employee and their dependents and
beneficiaries, the CEPCB Plans shall not include a waiting or eligibility
period or a pre-existing condition restriction or limitation and to the extent
that Company Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries have satisfied
any internal limits, deductibles or co-payment requirements under the
Employee Benefit Plans, such amounts shall be credited toward the satisfaction
of any such requirements under the CEPCB Plans. CEPCB further agrees not to
amend any Employee Benefit Plan or CEPCB Plan during the twelve month period
following the Closing if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce any
benefit that would have been provided to a Company Employee under such plan
without such amendment.

(b) CEPCB shall be responsible for workers compensation benefits including,
but not limited to, payments for indemnity, medical expenses and settlements,
that are payable on or after the Closing Date, regardless of whether the
injury, accident or illness occurred before the Closing Date and shall pay
such benefits.



 

\- 34 - (c) CEPCB agrees that it will credit Company Employees with vacation time,
sick leave, and universal leave that is earned under the terms of the
Transferred Companies vacation, sick leave, and universal leave policies in
effect prior to the Closing Date but is unused as of the Closing Date to the
extent accrued on the Transferred Companies books, and CEPCB will recognize
(or cause the Transferred Companies to recognize) service with the Transferred
Companies for purposes of earning vacation time, sick leave, and universal
leave from and after the Closing Date.

(d) CEPCB agrees that it will establish or designate an employee pension
benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that satisfies
the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _CEPCB 401(k) Plan_ ").
CEPCB further agrees to cause the CEPCB 401(k) Plan to accept a Company
Employees "rollover" of his or her interest in any Employee Benefit Plan
that satisfies the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code to the extent
such rollover (or portion thereof) is in cash, and it will use its best
efforts to cause the CEPCB 401(k) Plan to accept such a rollover (or portion
thereof) to the extent such rollover is in cash and a promissory note
representing a Company Employees outstanding participant loan; provided that
such rollover is an "eligible rollover distribution" (as defined in Section
402 of the Code). 

(e) The Company will take such actions as are necessary and requested of it by
CEPCB to terminate the Transferred Companies participation in the AMVEST
Corporation Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan, AMVEST Corporation Retiree Medical
Savings Plan, and AMVEST Minerals Company 401(k) Retirement Plan (collectively
the " _401(k) Plans_ "), with such termination to be effective on or prior to
the Closing Date. CEPCB shall have no obligation to contribute to the 401(k)
Plans after the date of Closing. AMVEST will continue to sponsor and maintain
the 401(k) Plans and no assets of the 401(k) Plans shall be spun-off to
CEPCBs 401(k) plan. Affected Company Employees shall have a "severance from
employment" (within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code and its
applicable regulations) entitling them to a distribution of their accounts
from the 401(k) Plans as of the Closing Date.

(f) Seller shall update _Schedule 4.9(n)_ as of the Closing Date to
reflect, as of the Closing Date (i) Company Employees and former employees
and their qualified beneficiaries (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code)
who are receiving COBRA benefits, (ii) Company Employees and former employees
who had a qualifying event described in Section 4980B(f)(3)(B) of the Code
after the date hereof and before the Closing Date and (iii) Company Employees
and former employees and their qualified beneficiaries (as defined in Section
4980B of the Code) who the Seller or the Transferred Companies know, or have
reason to know, after due inquiry, have had a qualifying event described in
Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Code (other then Section 4980B(f)(3)(B)) after the
date hereof and before the Closing Date.

Section 6.7 _Access to Books and Records_.

At Sellers expense, Seller and its authorized officers, employees, agents and
representatives shall have reasonable access after the Closing Date to the
properties, books, records, contracts, information and documents of the
Transferred Companies for any reasonable and necessary business purpose,
including, but not limited to, matters relating to Taxes; _provided, however_
, such access by Seller (a) shall be conducted during the normal business
hours of the Transferred Companies, (b) shall not unreasonably interfere with
the operations and  



 

\- 35 -  activities of the Transferred Companies, and (c) shall be provided upon at
least seven but not more than twenty days written notice. CEPCB shall,
and shall cause each Transferred Company to, cooperate, in all reasonable
respects with Sellers review of such information, including, without
limitation, retaining all such information until Seller has notified CEPCB in
writing that all tax years (including any portion of a tax year) prior to and
including the Closing Date have been closed or for seven years, whichever is
longer. The parties agree that, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Seller shall retain all Income Tax Returns relating to any or all
of the Transferred Companies for taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and all original work papers generated or used in connection with
preparing such Income Tax Returns.

Section 6.8 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Federal Income Taxes in General_.

(i) The Tax items of the Transferred Companies for periods ending on or before
the Closing Date shall be included in the consolidated federal Income Tax
Return of the affiliated group, within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the
Code, of which Seller is a member (the " _Seller Group_ "). Except as
otherwise provided in this  _Section 6.8_, Seller shall be responsible for
any federal Income Taxes of the Transferred Companies, to the extent not paid
before Closing, and shall be entitled to any reductions in such Taxes or
refunds (including interest), for taxable periods ending on or before or,
with respect to the consolidated federal Income Tax Return of Seller Group,
including the Closing Date. If CEPCB, any of its Affiliates or any of the
Transferred Companies receive any such refund, CEPCB shall promptly pay (or
cause such Transferred Company to pay) the entire amount of the refund
(including interest) to Seller.

(ii) CEPCB and the Transferred Companies shall be responsible for all federal
Income Taxes of the Transferred Companies for any taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date and, with respect to prior taxable periods, for all
federal Income Taxes resulting from any action taken without Sellers written
consent by CEPCB, any of its Affiliates or the Transferred Companies after the
Closing (including, without limitation, actions taken outside the Ordinary
Course of Business and occurring on the Closing Date). CEPCB and the
Transferred Companies shall be entitled to all refunds of such Taxes
(including interest).

(b) _State Income Taxes in General_.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _State Income Tax_ " means any
Income Tax imposed by a state or political subdivision of a state in the
United States or by the District of Columbia. Seller shall be responsible for
preparing and filing the State Income Tax Returns of the Transferred Companies
for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 6.8_, Seller shall be responsible for any State
Income Taxes of the Transferred Companies, to the extent not paid before
Closing, and shall be entitled to any reductions in such Taxes or refunds
(including interest) for such taxable periods. If CEPCB, any of its Affiliates
or any of the Transferred Companies receives any such refund, CEPCB shall
promptly pay (or cause the Transferred Companies to pay) the entire amount of
such refund (including interest) to Seller.



 

\- 36 - (ii) CEPCB and the Transferred Companies shall be responsible for all State
Income Taxes of the Transferred Companies for any taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date and, with respect to prior taxable periods, for all
State Income Taxes resulting from any action taken without Sellers written
consent by CEPCB, any of its Affiliates or the Transferred Companies after
the Closing (including, without limitation, actions taken outside the Ordinary
Course of Business and occurring on the Closing Date). CEPCB and the
Transferred Companies shall be entitled to all refunds of such Taxes
(including interest).

(c) _Tax Treatment of the Merger_.

(i) The parties acknowledge and agree that, for Income Tax purposes, the
Merger is to be treated as (i) a sale of the assets of the
Transferred Companies by the Company to Constellation Energy Partners LLC,
the sole owner of CEPCB (which is a disregarded entity for Income Tax
purposes), and a purchase of the Transferred Companies assets from the
Company by Constellation Energy Partners LLC, for the Purchase Price (as
adjusted pursuant to _Sections 2.6_ and 2.7 and Article X hereof) and the
assumption of liabilities of the Transferred Companies, followed by (ii) the
complete liquidation of the Company into Seller pursuant to Sections 332 and
337 of the Code. The parties agree not to take, and not to permit any
Affiliate to take, any position inconsistent with such intended Income Tax
consequences.

(ii) CEPCB and Seller shall cooperate to determine, in accordance with all
applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1060 of the Code,
the deemed sale prices of the Transferred Companies assets. No later than
Closing, CEPCB and Seller shall agree on a preliminary determination of the
deemed sale prices, which shall be based on the Purchase Price and the
Transferred Companies liabilities (as of the end of the last month ending at
least 30 days before the Closing Date) that the parties expect will be
included in the amount realized for federal Income Tax purposes on the deemed
sale of assets. CEPCB shall propose (subject to Sellers review and comment)
the preliminary determination to Seller no later than five (5) Business Days
before the Closing Date, and once agreed upon, the preliminary determination
shall be attached to this Agreement as _Schedule 6.8(c)_. Thereafter, CEPCB
shall propose a final determination of the deemed sale prices and shall notify
Seller in writing of the prices so determined (" _CEPCB s Deemed Sale Price
Notice_") within 10 days after the final determination of the Final Net
Working Capital Amount pursuant to _Section 2.6_. Seller shall be deemed to
have accepted such proposed final determination unless, within 30 days after
the date of Sellers receipt of CEPCBs Deemed Sale Price Notice, Seller
notifies CEPCB in writing of (A) each proposed deemed sale price with which
Seller disagrees and (B) for each such price, the amount that Seller proposes
as the deemed sale price. If Seller provides such notice to CEPCB, the
parties shall proceed in good faith to determine mutually the deemed sale
prices in dispute. If CEPCB and Seller are unable to agree upon the deemed
sale prices of the assets within 30 days after CEPCBs receipt of such notice
from Seller, then any deemed sale prices still in dispute shall be referred to
the accounting firm selected pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_. Seller and CEPCB
shall equally share all fees and any other charges of the accounting firm.
The accounting firm shall be instructed to deliver to Seller and CEPCB a
written determination of the deemed sale prices in dispute within 20 days
after the parties submission of the disputed items to the accounting firm.
Such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties shall mutually adjust the deemed
sale prices as determined hereunder (whether or not any matter has been
referred to the accounting firm) to the  



 

\- 37 -  extent necessary to reflect any subsequent adjustment to the Purchase Price.
Neither CEPCB nor Seller shall take, nor shall either permit any of
their Affiliates (including, without limitation, the Transferred Companies)
to take, any position for Income Tax purposes that is inconsistent with the
deemed sale prices as finally determined hereunder; _provided, however_ , that
(Y) the deemed purchase prices of the assets may differ from the deemed sale
prices in order to reflect CEPCBs transaction costs not included in the total
deemed sale prices, and (Z) the amount realized on the deemed sale of assets
may differ from the deemed sale prices in order to reflect transaction costs
that reduce the amount realized for federal Income Tax purposes.

(d)  _Cooperation_.

(i) CEPCB agrees to cooperate and to cause the Transferred Companies to
cooperate with Seller to the extent reasonably required after the Closing
Date in connection with (i) the filing, amendment, preparation and execution
of all federal Income Tax Returns and State Income Tax Returns with respect to
any taxable period of any of the Transferred Companies ending on or before
the Closing Date, (ii) contests concerning the federal Income Tax or State
Income Tax due for any such period and (iii) audits and other proceedings
relating to Income Taxes with respect to any such period. Within a
reasonable time (but not more than ten (10) days) after CEPCB, any of its
Affiliates or any of the Transferred Companies receives official notice of any
such contest, audit or other proceeding, CEPCB shall notify Seller in writing
of such contest, audit or other proceeding. In any case where any of the
Transferred Companies is responsible under applicable Law for the defense of
such contest, audit or other proceeding, Seller shall have the right to
conduct the defense at its expense, whether such contest, audit or other
proceeding commenced before or commences after the Closing. Notwithstanding
Sellers obligations under the preceding provisions of this _Section 6.8_,
Seller shall have no obligation to pay or to indemnify or hold CEPCB or any
of the Transferred Companies harmless from any Tax imposed or assessed as a
result of (i) the failure of CEPCB to notify Seller as required by this
paragraph, if such failure adversely affects Sellers ability to
respond adequately in a timely manner to the notice of contest, audit or
other proceeding, or (ii) any action taken by CEPCB, any of its Affiliates or
any of the Transferred Companies with respect to any contest, audit or other
proceeding without Sellers written consent.

(ii) The amount of any Income Tax reimbursement otherwise payable by Seller
under this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of any federal Income Tax
or State Income Tax benefit to CEPCB, any of its Affiliates or the Transferred
Companies resulting from any adjustment to or change in any Tax item relating
to the Transferred Companies for any taxable period ending before or
including the Closing Date.

(iii) Seller agrees to make available to CEPCB and the Transferred Companies
records in the custody of Seller or of any member of Seller Group, to furnish
other information and otherwise to cooperate to the extent reasonably required
for the filing or audit of or other proceeding with respect to federal Income
Tax Returns and State Income Tax Returns relating to the Transferred
Companies for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date. However, no
loss, credit or other item of the Transferred Companies may be carried back
without Sellers written consent, which Seller may withhold in its absolute
discretion, to a taxable period for which (i) any of the Transferred Companies
and (ii) Seller or any entity affiliated with Seller filed a consolidated,
unitary, combined or similar Tax Return. 



 

\- 38 - (iv) Seller agrees to cooperate with CEPCB, and CEPCB agrees to cooperate (and
cause the Transferred Companies to cooperate) with Seller, to the extent
necessary in connection with the filing of any Tax Return relating to CEPCBs
acquisition of the Transferred Companies.

(e) _Termination of Tax-Sharing Agreement_. After the Closing, this _Section
6.8_ shall supersede any and all Tax-sharing or similar agreements to which
(i) any of the Transferred Companies, on the one hand, and (ii) Seller or any
affiliated entity, on the other hand, are parties. Neither the Transferred
Companies nor Seller or any such affiliated entity shall have any obligation
or right with respect to each other under any such prior agreement after the
Closing.

(f) _Other Tax Returns and Taxes_. 

(i) CEPCB and the Transferred Companies (and not Seller) shall be responsible
for preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the Transferred Companies other
than those Tax Returns to which _Sections 6.8(a)_ through _6.8(c)_ apply ("
_Other Tax Returns_ "). Except as otherwise required by Law or expressly
agreed in writing by Seller and CEPCB, (i) each Other Tax Return filed after
the Closing Date for any period ending on or before or including the Closing
Date shall be based on the same accounting methods and Tax elections as used
for the same type of Other Tax Return filed most recently before the Closing
Date, and (ii) no amended Other Tax Return may be filed for a period ending on
or before or including the Closing Date.

(ii) For purposes of preparing the Final Closing Balance Sheet pursuant to
_Section 2.6_, in the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the day before the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), Taxes
other than Income Taxes will be allocated between the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the day before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Portion_ ")
and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning on the Closing Date as
provided in this _Section 6.8(f)(ii)_. The amount of such Taxes allocable to
the Pre-Closing Portion will be determined on the basis of a deemed closing of
the books of the Transferred Companies as of the close of business on the day
before the Closing Date; provided, that in the case of ad valorem Taxes and
any other Tax that is a fixed amount for the entire taxable period, the amount
of each such Tax allocable to the Pre-Closing Portion will be equal to the
product of each such Tax multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period from the commencement of such period
through and including the day before the Closing Date, and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. The amount of
Taxes (other than Income Taxes) for a Straddle Period not allocable to the
Pre-Closing Portion shall be allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
beginning on the Closing Date.

(g) _Relationship of Section 6.8 to Article X_. All conditions or limitations
set forth in Article X with respect to monetary amount of claims or liability
shall apply to any claim or liability to which this Section 6.8 applies or to
any breach of any obligation under this Section 6.8. Seller shall have no
liability under this Agreement for any Taxes of any of the
Transferred Companies except (i) as otherwise expressly provided in this
Section 6.8, subject to the limitations set forth in Article X and (ii)
without duplication, as provided in Article X for inaccuracy or breach of a
representation or warranty made by Seller in Section 4.12.



 

\- 39 - (h) _Clearance Certificate_. At CEPCBs request made not less than three
Business Days prior to Closing, Seller will cause Company to execute with
CEPCB a written authorization to the Taxpayer Assistance Division of the
Oklahoma Tax Commission requesting a Clearance Certificate. For these
purposes, a " _Clearance Certificate_ " shall mean a certificate or if a
certificate is not issuable, other document which indicates that, according to
the Oklahoma Tax Commissions records, none of the Transferred Companies has
outstanding any liability for Taxes administered by the Oklahoma Tax
Commission under relevant Oklahoma Tax laws.

(i) _Survival_. _Section 10.1_ shall apply to the survival of the covenants
and obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

Section 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller will promptly
notify CEPCB in writing if any of the officers identified on _Schedule A(2)_
becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or constitutes a breach of
any of Sellers representations and warranties, or if any such officer becomes
aware of the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact
or condition that would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement)
cause or constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty. Should
any such fact or condition require any change in the Schedules to this
Agreement in order for such representation and warranty to be true when made
or as of the Closing Date, Seller will promptly deliver to CEPCB a new or
revised Schedule specifying such change. Seller will give prompt written
notice to CEPCB of any failure of Seller to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant to be complied with or satisfied by such Person
hereunder. No such notification or change in the Schedules shall affect the
representations or warranties of Seller, or the conditions to CEPCBs
obligations hereunder.

Section 6.10 _WARN Act_.

During the one (1) year period immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller
has not effectuated (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the Federal Worker
Adjustment, Retraining and Notification Act of 1988, the " _WARN Act_ ", as
amended) affecting any site of employment of any of the facilities of the
Transferred Companies covered by this transaction (the " _Employment Sites_
"); or (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined by the WARN Act) affecting any of the
Employment Sites; nor has Seller been affected by any transaction or engaged
in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger
application of any similar state or local law at any of the Employment Sites.
Seller shall be solely responsible for and subject to any and all liabilities
in connection with the performance and discharge of all obligations or
requirements under the WARN Act and under applicable state and local laws and
regulations that may arise prior to the Closing Date.

CEPCB shall not engage within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date in a
"plant closing" or "mass layoff" as such terms are defined in the WARN Act, if
such employment loss would create any liability for the Seller immediately
prior to the Closing Date, unless CEPCB delivers notice under the WARN Act in
such a manner and at such a time that such Seller bears no liability with
respect thereto.



 

\- 40 - CEPCB shall be responsible for all expenses and liabilities, including
attorneys fees, if applicable, incurred under the WARN Act or any other Law
requiring notice prior to termination of employment or the payment of
severance pay, wages or benefits with respect to any employee who experiences
a layoff, employment termination, reduction in hours or other employment
related loss after the Closing.

Agreement_ ") by and between AMVEST Osage, Inc. and Constellation Energy
Commodities Group, Inc. (on behalf of CEPCB) shall remain in full force and
effect until the Closing Date (or if the Closing does not occur for any
reason, the agreement shall continue for the time period specified
therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Seller determines
in good faith that there is a strong probability that it will enter into a
definitive agreement regarding a Change of Control Event, it may provide a
copy of this Agreement to the party expected to enter into such definitive
agreement provided that such party has signed a confidentiality agreement
substantially similar to the Confidentiality Agreement, provided, however, no
such disclosure shall occur until the filings contemplated in _Section
6.5(ii)_ have been made. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, CEPCB and
its Affiliates may discuss the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with the Department of Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs Osage Agency and THE
OSAGE NATION, provided, however, no such disclosure shall occur until the
filings contemplated in _Section 6.5(ii)_ have been made.

Section 6.12 _Exclusivity_.

Seller agrees that, from the date hereof through and including the earlier of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_ hereof, Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause each other
Transferred Company, and its and their respective Affiliates and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) discuss, negotiate,
undertake, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into, either as the
proposed, surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired corporation, any material
transaction involving a merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase
or disposition of any amount of the assets or capital stock of or other equity
interest in any of the Transferred Companies (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) (a " _Competing Transaction_ "), (b)
facilitate, encourage, solicit, initiate or participate in discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of a proposed

facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any Person (other than CEPCB
and its Affiliates and representatives) to do or seek any of the
foregoing, except in each of the foregoing cases with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this _Section 6.12_ or any other provision of this Agreement shall preclude
AMVEST Corporation or any of its Affiliates from pursuing the sale of any or
all of its assets, or any or all of the shares of capital stock or membership
interests, as applicable, of its subsidiaries or itself, other than the
assets, capital stock or membership interests of the Transferred Companies.



 

\- 41 - Section 6.13 _Use of Name_. Within sixty (60) days following the Closing,

learning of the same, shall promptly notify Seller of any proceeding which is
commenced or threatened against CEPCB or any of its Affiliates and which

against Seller or such Transferred Company and which affects this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and any proceeding which is commenced
or threatened against Seller or any Transferred Company and which would have
been listed on _Schedule 3.5_ or _Schedule 4.6_ if such proceeding had arisen
prior to the date hereof.

Section 6.15 _Release of Bonds_. Within 30 days following the Closing Date,
CEPCB shall cause to be secured those replacement bonds, replacement sureties,
guarantees or other financial security, if applicable, that are sufficient to
cause the complete release of Seller and its Affiliates from those bonds,

be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and CEPCB;

(b) by Seller or CEPCB, if the Closing Date shall not have occurred on
or before July 26, 2007, unless extended by Seller and CEPCB in accordance
with _Section 9.4_ (provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party who has breached
in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements under this Agreement and such breach has been the cause of, or has
resulted in, the failure of the Closing Date to occur on or before such
date); 

(c) by Seller if there has been a material breach by CEPCB of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
or any certificate or other instrument delivered or furnished to Seller
pursuant hereto, which breach has not been cured within ten (10) Business Days
following receipt by CEPCB of notice of such breach (it being understood
that disclosure after the date hereof is not deemed to cure any such breach);

(d) by CEPCB if there has been a material breach by Seller or the Company of

Business Days following receipt by Seller of notice of such breach (it being
understood that disclosure after the date hereof is not deemed to cure any

(e) by Seller or CEPCB, if any court of competent jurisdiction or other

_Section 9.1(c)_ above, then the Earnest Money Deposit shall be released to
Seller immediately upon (and in no event more than three days after) such

hereunder. Seller and CEPCB agree that Sellers damages resulting from CEPCBs

Section 9.3 _Amendment_.

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of both of the parties hereto.

time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto by the other party hereto or (iii) waive compliance

hereto. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.

made by any such party not misleading and agree to waive any right or remedy
available by Law in connection with the foregoing. CEPCB and Seller further

(in the event that the Closing does not occur for any reason),  _Section
6.7_ or _Section 6.10_ hereof) contained in this Agreement, or in any
certificates, agreements or instruments executed in connection herewith or
delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive the Closing until
the Indemnification Escrow Termination Date and shall only be effective with
respect to any such breach for which notice of such breach shall have been
given in writing to the other party in breach or against whom indemnification

pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ or _Section 10.3(b)_ for any Seller Claim to
the extent that any of the persons listed on _Schedule A(2)_ had knowledge of
such breach, inaccuracy or default prior to the Closing.

Section 10.2 _Indemnification of CEPCB Indemnified Parties_.

Upon Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 10.1, Section
10.4_, _Section 10.7_ and/or _Section 10.8_ hereof, as applicable, Seller

\- 47 -  each of its Affiliates, partners, members, shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, representatives, successors, permitted assigns and other
agents (collectively, the " _CEPCB Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and
against any and all claims, demands, suits, proceedings, judgments, losses,
liabilities, damages, costs and expenses of every kind and nature (including,

imposed upon or incurred by any CEPCB Indemnified Party (each, a " _CEPCB
Claim_ ") as a result of or in connection with any of the following: 

(a) Any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Seller
under this Agreement or in any certificate, agreement or other instrument
executed in connection herewith or delivered pursuant hereto; and

(b) The breach of or default in the performance by Seller of any covenant,
agreement or obligation to be performed by Seller prior to the Closing Date
pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in

Section 10.3 _Indemnification by CEPCB_.

Upon Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 10.1_,
_Section 10.4, Section 10.7_ and/or _Section 10.8_ hereof, as applicable,
CEPCB agrees to indemnify and hold Seller and each of its Affiliates,
partners, members, shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
representatives, successors, permitted assigns and other agents (each a "
_Seller Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against any and all Losses imposed
upon or incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party (each, a " _Seller Claim_ "),
as a result of or in connection with any of the following:

(a) Any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by CEPCB
under this Agreement or in any certificate, agreement or other

(c) Any obligation or liability of the Transferred Companies set forth on the
Final Closing Balance Sheet or arising from the operation of the business

Section 10.4 _Limitation of Liability_.

(a) The CEPCB Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any payments in
respect of Losses incurred by any CEPCB Indemnified Party pursuant to 
_Section 10.2(a)_, and the Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled
to any payments in respect of Losses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_, in either case unless and until the aggregate
amount of such Losses exceeds an amount equal to 1.5% of the Purchase Price
(the " _Basket_ "), in which event the party seeking indemnity may recover the
full amount of such Losses, other than the amount of the Basket, provided
that recovery under any provision of this _Article X_ by either the CEPCB
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, in
respect of  



 

48  such Losses shall be limited, in the case of Losses incurred by the CEPCB
Indemnified Parties, to the CEPCB Indemnification Escrow portion of the
CEPCB Escrow Fund, and in the case of Losses incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties, shall be limited to an amount equal to $16 million, but
there shall be no limits in the case of Losses incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties under  _Section 10.3(c)_ or as a result of a breach of
any covenant set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_, _Section 6.6_ or _Section 6.10_
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Basket shall not apply to any
liability arising from a breach of the representations and warranties set out
in _Sections 3.1_ (Organization), _3.2_ (Authorization; Execution and
Delivery; Enforceability), _3.4_ (Ownership of the Company Common Stock),
_4.1_  (Organization and Authority of the Transferred Companies), _4.2_
(Capitalization), _Section 4.12_ (Tax Matters), _Section 4.14_ (Fees and
Expenses of Brokers and Others), _Section 4.16(h)_ (Title),  _Section 5.1_
(Organization and Authority of CEPCB) and _Section 5.2_ (Authority Relative
to this Agreement). Except with regard to the Sellers obligations under
_Section 6.3(b)_, the CEPCB Indemnification Escrow portion of the CEPCB
Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive source of funds for satisfaction
of any liability to the CEPCB Indemnified Parties hereunder in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without
limitation, to satisfy any Losses incurred by the CEPCB Indemnified Parties
and any Working Capital Shortfall that exceeds the Working Capital Escrow, in
each case to the extent provided herein).

(b) At any time after the Closing, but immediately prior to the occurrence of
a Change of Control Event, Seller may request, and CEPCB agrees to provide, a
written statement signed by CEPCB and delivered to the parties participating
in the Change of Control Event stating that Seller and all of its Affiliates
have no obligations or liabilities under this Agreement other than CEPCBs
recourse to the CEPCB Escrow Fund and under _Section 6.3(b)_ and under
_Section 11.10_, as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

Section 10.5 _Notice of Indemnity Claims_.

If a party intends to assert a CEPCB Claim or a Seller Claim (a CEPCB Claim
or a Seller Claim being hereafter referred to as an " _Indemnity Claim_ " in
this _Section 10.5_), the party intending to assert an Indemnity Claim shall
provide the party from whom indemnification is sought with notice of such
Indemnity Claim within 30 days after receiving notice of such Indemnity Claim;
_provided, however,_ that the failure to provide such notice shall not release
the party from whom indemnification is sought from any of its obligations
under this _Article X_, except to the extent that such party is materially
harmed by such failure (and then only to the extent of such harm) or under any
other provision of this Agreement. At the time the Indemnity Claim is made
and thereafter, any party asserting the Indemnity Claim shall provide the
party against which the Indemnity Claim is asserted with copies of any
materials in its possession describing the facts or containing information
providing the basis for the Indemnity Claim. In the event any Person receives
a notice of claim for indemnity pursuant to this _Article X_ that does not
involve a claim by a third party, the party against which the Indemnity Claim
is asserted hereunder shall notify the party asserting the Indemnity Claim,
within 30 days following such partys receipt of such notice, if the party
against which the Indemnity Claim is asserted disputes its liability hereunder
with respect to such Indemnity Claim. If the party against which the
Indemnity Claim is asserted fails to so notify the party asserting such
Indemnity Claim, such Indemnity Claim shall be conclusively deemed to be a
liability of the party against which such Indemnity Claim is
asserted hereunder, and such party shall pay the amount of such liability to
 



 

\- 49 -  the party asserting such Indemnity Claim on demand or, in the case of any
Indemnity Claim for which all or any portion of the amount thereof is
estimated, on such later date when such estimated portion of the Indemnity
Claim becomes finally determined.

If the Indemnity Claim involves a claim by a third party (a " _Third Party
Indemnity Claim_ "), the party against which the Third Party Indemnity Claim
is asserted may assume at its expense the defense of the claim by the third
party, provided that such party against which the Third Party Indemnity Claim
is asserted agrees in writing with respect to such Third Party Indemnity Claim
that it is obligated hereunder to indemnify and hold any party asserting the
Third Party Indemnity Claim harmless in accordance with the terms of this
_Article X_; and _provided, further_ , that the party asserting the Third
Party Indemnity Claim shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
claim at its own expense. The failure of any party against which the
Third Party Indemnity Claim is asserted to assume the defense of any such
claim shall not affect any indemnification obligation under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the party against which the Indemnity Claim
is asserted hereunder shall not be entitled to assume the defense or control
of a Third Party Indemnity Claim and shall pay the fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the party asserting the Indemnity Claim hereunder if (i)
such Third Party Indemnity Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, or (ii)
a primary objective of such Third Party Indemnity Claim is to seek injunctive
or other equitable relief against the party asserting the Indemnity Claim
hereunder, provided that, in any such case, the party against which the
Indemnity Claim is asserted hereunder shall have the right to retain its own
counsel (but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such party) and participate in the defense of such Third Party Indemnity
Claim, and the party against which the Indemnity Claim is asserted hereunder
shall not be liable for any settlement of such Third Party Indemnity Claim
without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), and (b) in the event any Third Party Indemnity Claim is brought or
asserted which, if adversely determined, would not entitle the party asserting
the Indemnity Claim hereunder to full indemnity pursuant to this _Article X_
by reason of any of the limitations set forth in this _Article X_, the party
asserting such Indemnified Claim hereunder may elect to participate in a joint
defense of such Third Party Indemnity Claim for which the expenses of such
joint defense will be shared equally by such parties and the retention of
counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to both parties.

Section 10.6 _Arbitration_.

Except with respect to any claim seeking specific performance or other
equitable relief regarding any Persons obligations hereunder, if any dispute
should arise between the parties hereto as to any matter covered by this
Agreement, including any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.2_ or _Section 10.3_, or with respect to any dispute arising pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement, then, in lieu of any suit or action in regard to any
such matter, the controversy shall be submitted to arbitration in the
following manner:

The party desiring to submit such controversy to arbitration shall give to
the other party notice in writing, stating with specificity the matter upon
which an award is desired and naming the arbitrator selected by such party.
Within 10 days following the receipt of such notice, the other party shall
give written notice to the party desiring such arbitration of the arbitrator
selected by it. Thereafter, the two arbitrators so chosen shall select a
third. If such two  



 

\- 50 -  arbitrators are unable to agree upon a third arbitrator within 20 days from
the naming of the second arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be
appointed, upon application of either of the parties hereto, by the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The arbitrators
thus chosen shall give to each of the parties hereto written notice of the
time and place of hearing, which hearing shall be held not less than 10 days,
nor more than 20 days, after the selection of the third arbitrator, and at the
time and place appointed, and shall proceed with the hearing unless for some
good cause, of which a majority of the arbitrators shall be the judge, it
shall be postponed until some other day within a reasonable time. The parties
hereto shall have full opportunity to be heard on any question thus submitted,
and the determination by a majority of the arbitrators shall be made in
writing and a copy thereof delivered to each of the parties hereto. The
arbitrators shall in every case deliver their decision within 60 days after
the hearing, unless the parties shall otherwise agree to extend the time.
The arbitrators, as a part of their decision and award, shall decide the
amount of the costs of arbitration and by whom they shall be borne and paid.

Section 10.7 _Indemnity Amounts to be Computed on After-Tax Basis_.

The amount of any indemnification payable under any of the provisions of this
_Article X _shall be (i) net of any actual federal Income Tax benefit or
State Income Tax benefit realized or the then present value, based on a
discount rate of 6%, of any such undisputed (in good faith) Tax benefit to be
realized by the indemnified party (or, where CEPCB is the indemnified party,
any of the Transferred Companies) by reason of the facts and circumstances
giving rise to the indemnification, and (ii) increased by the amount of
any actual federal Income Tax or State Income Tax required to be paid by the
indemnified party on the accrual or receipt of the indemnification payment
(including any amount payable pursuant to this clause (ii)). For purposes of
the preceding sentence, the amount of any State Income Tax benefit or cost
shall take into account the federal Income Tax effect of such benefit or cost.

Section 10.8 _Indemnity Matters_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) no
CEPCB Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any CEPCB
Claim to the extent that an amount has been reserved for or accrued in the
Financial Statements, and (ii) no party shall be liable for an Indemnity Claim
to the extent it arose from (x) a change in accounting or a Law related to
Taxes, policy or practice made after the Closing Date, (y) any legislation not
in force on the Closing Date, or (z) a claim which is contingent unless and
until such contingent claim becomes an actual liability of the indemnified
party and is due and payable, so long as such claim was timely submitted
pursuant to this _Article X_, provided, that the foregoing shall not limit
any Person from recovering any Losses related to expenses incurred in
connection with a contingent claim to the extent such party is otherwise
entitled to be indemnified for such Losses under this _Article X_.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the amount of any
indemnification payable under this _Article X_ shall be reduced by the
amount of any proceeds actually received by the indemnified party on account
of the indemnified Loss as compensation for, and in satisfaction of, such
Loss. The parties hereto agree that in seeking indemnification payable under
this _ Article X_, each such party shall (i) exercise good faith in not
taking any  



 

\- 51 -  action, or failing to take any action, that would jeopardize or prejudice
the interests of an indemnifying party and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue all rights and remedies of an indemnified party
or its Affiliates under any insurance policy or any other obligation of
indemnification in its favor.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the CEPCB
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement with respect to any CEPCB Claim relating to any Environmental Laws,
except to the extent such CEPCB Claim represents amounts actually incurred by
CEPCB for (i) the performance of remedial action or the payments of any fine,
penalty or damage award, in each case ordered by a Governmental Authority or
in reasonable settlement of a claim of noncompliance with any Environmental
Law asserted by any Governmental Authority or other third party (and related
out of pocket fees and expenses); and/or (ii) the performance of remedial
action taken by CEPCB in order to achieve or maintain minimum levels of
compliance with applicable Environmental Laws.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any applicable
Law to the contrary, it is understood and agreed by CEPCB and Seller that no
director, officer, employee, agent, shareholder or Affiliate of Seller,
including (whether or not a Change of Control Event has occurred) the
Shareholders and the Shareholders Representative, shall have (i) any personal
liability to a CEPCB Indemnified Party as a result of the breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller contained herein or
otherwise arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (ii) any personal obligation to indemnify the CEPCB Indemnified
Parties for any of their claims pursuant to _Section 10.2_, and CEPCB, for
itself and all other CEPCB Indemnified Parties, hereby waives and releases and
shall have no recourse against any of such persons described in this _Section
10.8(d)_ as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of Seller contained herein or otherwise arising out of
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 10.9 _Damages Disclaimer_.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, CLAIMS AND
LOSSES ASSERTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES AND
IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HERETO BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; PROVIDED
HOWEVER THAT THIS WAIVER SHALL NOT APPLY WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS ASSERTED BY A
THIRD PARTY (BEING A PERSON OTHER THAN A CEPCB INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR A SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTY) FOR WHICH ONE PARTY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT.

ARTICLE XI

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 11.1 _Brokerage Fees and Commissions_.

No broker, finder or investment banker (other than the Financial Advisor,
whose fees shall be paid by Seller) is entitled to any brokerage, finders or
other similar fee or commission  



 

\- 52 -  in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Seller; and no broker, finder
or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of CEPCB.

Section 11.2 _Entire Agreement_.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes, all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties or
any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Section 11.3 _Assignment; Shareholders  Representative_.

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any rights hereunder may be assigned by any
party hereto except (i) with the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto or (ii) by Seller, upon prior written notice to CEPCB, directly to
Sellers parent company, AMVEST Corporation, and then to the Shareholders of
AMVEST Corporation or directly to the Shareholders of AMVEST Corporation,
as contemplated in _Section 11.3(b)_ below.

(b) It is contemplated that shortly after Closing, there may be a Change of
Control Event. In advance of such Change of Control Event, it is further
contemplated that Seller may desire to assign certain rights and benefits
remaining under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement directly or indirectly
to the shareholders of AMVEST Corporation (the " _Shareholders_ "). In the
event that Seller makes the assignment of such rights and benefits in and
under this Merger Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement directly or indirectly
to the Shareholders, then such assignment shall not be effective as against
CEPCB or the Escrow Agent (and each shall have the right to continue to look
to Seller for performance hereof and thereof), unless and until a
representative is appointed by Shareholders (the " _Shareholders 
Representative_") and Seller and Shareholders shall deliver a written notice
(the " _Shareholders  Rep Appointment Notice_") thereof to CEPCB and the
Escrow Agent, and provide with such written notice the name, contact
information and any designated account information for receipt of funds for
the Shareholders Representative, together with an original counterpart of an
agreement (" _Joinder Agreemen_ t") duly executed by Seller, the
Shareholders Representative and the Shareholders, substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit A to the Escrow Agreement. Except for acts of fraud of the
Shareholders Representative, neither the Shareholders Representative nor
the Shareholders shall have any personal liability to CEPCB, any CEPCB
Indemnified Parties or the Escrow Agent in connection with his or her
appointment as the Shareholders Representative or the performance of his or
her duties and responsibilities; provided, however, that CEPCB shall continue
to have all rights and remedies to enforce the terms of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement with regard to Seller, the Shareholders and the
Shareholders Representative, as contemplated in Section 11.10 below. If the
Shareholders appoint the Shareholders Representative and the Shareholders
Representative provides CEPCB and the Escrow Agent with the Shareholders Rep
Appointment Notice and the original Joinder Agreement, as described above,
CEPCB shall thereafter look to the Shareholders Representative with regard to
the administration, decisions, elections, actions, agreements or dispute
resolutions that Shareholders would otherwise be entitled to make with regard
to the following rights and interests, which rights and interests shall be
part of any assignment by the Seller to Shareholders:

(i) all rights and responsibilities of Seller under _Section 2.6_ with
respect to (A) the determination of, and the resolution of disputes relating
to, the Net Working Capital adjustment, and (B) entitlement to the Working
Capital Surplus and any other payments to be made by CEPCB thereunder;



 

\- 53 - (ii) all rights and responsibilities of Seller under _Section 2.7_ with
respect to the CEPCB Escrow Fund and the Seller Escrow Fund, including
Sellers entitlement to any distribution of all or part of the CEPCB Escrow
Fund and the Seller Escrow Fund;

(iii) all rights and responsibilities of Seller under _Article VIII_ with
respect to the receipt and delivery of closing documentation, including all
determinations as to the satisfactory form and substance thereof, the waiver
of closing conditions, and the issuance (without personal liability) of any
certification under _Section 8.3(d)_;

(iv) all rights of Seller under _Sections 9.1_ , _9.2_ and _9.4_ with respect
to a determination to terminate this Agreement, with respect to the Earnest
Money Deposit and with respect to any extensions and/or waivers thereunder;

(v) all rights of Seller to the Adjusted Purchase Price, to the extent not
paid prior to the Change of Control Event; 

(vi) all rights of Seller under _Section 9.3_ with respect to the amendment
of this Agreement, provided, however, that Sellers written consent shall be
required for any such amendment that would materially increase any of Sellers
retained obligations or potential liabilities under this Agreement; and

(vii) all rights of Seller under _Article X_ with respect to Indemnity Claims,
including (A) the rights to receive notices and assume or participate in the
defense of, and settle, third party claims and to arbitrate or otherwise
resolve disputes with respect to Indemnity Claims, and (B) Sellers
entitlement to payments from CEPCB thereunder, except to the extent such
claims and/or payments relate to Losses actually incurred and retained by
Seller.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section _11.3(b)_
shall not limit or alter in any manner the rights of CEPCB to enforce any
rights or remedies to which it is entitled under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, including without limitation the right to seek
specific performance pursuant to _Section 11.10_ hereof in the event Seller
or Shareholders Representative, as applicable, fails to perform its or her
obligations hereunder.

The Shareholders Representative may resign upon not less than ten (10)
Business Days prior written notice to each of the Seller (or its successors
or permitted assigns), CEPCB and the Escrow Agent; provided, however, that the
Shareholders Representative must continue to serve in such capacity until the
effective date of the resignation, which may not be prior to the appointment
of a new Shareholders Representative in the manner provided in the Joinder
Agreement and subject to the same terms and conditions described above and
until notice of the same has been provided to CEPCB and the Escrow Agent in
the manner contemplated above.



 

\- 54 - Section 11.4 _Disclosure Schedules_.

Certain of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
contemplate that there will be attached schedules setting forth information
that might be "material" or have a "Material Adverse Effect" or might not be
in the "Ordinary Course of Business." The Company may, at its option, include
in such schedules items or information that are not material or are not
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or are in the ordinary course of
business in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and any such inclusion shall
not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that such items are
material or would have a Material Adverse Effect, to establish any standard
of materiality, Material Adverse Effect or ordinary course of business, or to
define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 11.5 _Notices_.

All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be deemed to have been duly
given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by cable, telecopy, telegram or
telex, or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt
requested) to the respective parties as follows:

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York (including section 5-1401 of the New York

Section 11.8 _Parties in Interest_.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each

rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.

Section 11.12 _Severability_.

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to
either party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
