Purchaser Shareholder Indemnity. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article 12, each shareholder of Purchaser listed on **Exhibit** C attached

Purchaser Shareholders and their respective owners, officers, managers,
agents, attorneys and Affiliates (collectively, the " **Shareholder
Indemnified Persons** " and together with the Company Indemnified Persons, the


 



" **Indemnified Persons** ") from and against, and shall pay to Shareholder
Indemnified Persons the amount of, or reimburse the Shareholder Indemnified
Persons for, any Damage that any Shareholder Indemnified Person may suffer,
sustain, or become subject to, as a result of, in connection with, or relating
to:

(a)

any Breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or the
Sellers in this Agreement or any certificate delivered by the Company in

any Breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company or the Sellers in this
Agreement or in any certificate, document, or other writing delivered by the

12.03 shall be subject to the following limitations:

Persons for a Purchaser Representation Breach until the aggregate amount of
all Damages thereof exceeds $50,000 (the "Basket").

(b)

The aggregate amount of all Damages for which the Purchaser Shareholders shall
be required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company Indemnified
Persons hereunder for Purchaser Breaches shall in no event exceed $250,000
(the " **Cap** "). 

(c)

The Company shall not be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Persons for
indemnification under Section 12.3 until the aggregate amount of all Damages

to Section 12.03 shall not exceed the Cap, except for Company Breaches
relating to Sections 3.9 or 3.14.

12.5

_Third-Party Claims_.

(a)

A Person benefited by Section 12.2 or Section 12.3 shall give notice of the
assertion of a Third-Party Claim to Seller or Purchaser (an " **Indemnifying
Person** "), as the case may be; provided, however, that no failure or delay
on the part of an Indemnified Person in notifying an Indemnifying Person will
relieve the Indemnifying Person from any obligation under this Article 12
except to the extent that the failure or delay materially prejudices the
defense of the Third-Party Claim by the Indemnifying Person.

(b)

Except as provided in Section 12.5(c), the Indemnifying Person may elect to
assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person by (i) giving notice to the Indemnified Person of its
election to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim and (ii) giving the
Indemnified Person evidence acceptable to the Indemnified Person that the
Indemnifying Person has adequate financial resources to defend against the
Third-Party Claim and fulfill its obligations under this Article 12, in each
case no later than 10 days after the Indemnified Person gives notice of the
assertion of a Third-Party Claim under Section 12.5(a).

(i)

If the Indemnifying Person elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim:


 



(A)

it shall diligently conduct the defense and, so long as it diligently conducts
the defense, shall not be liable to the Indemnified Person for any Indemnified
Persons fees or expenses subsequently incurred in connection with the defense
of the Third-Party Claim other than reasonable costs of investigation;

(B)

the election will conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that
the Indemnified Person is entitled to relief under this Agreement for any
Damage arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with the Third-
Party Claim (subject to the provisions of Section 12.4);

(C)

no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim may be effected by the
Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Persons consent unless (I) there
is no finding or admission of any violation by the Indemnified Person of any
Applicable Legal Requirement or any rights of any Person, (II) the Indemnified
Person receives a full release of and from any other claims that may be made
against the Indemnified Person by the Third Party bringing the Third-Party
Claim, and (III) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full by the Indemnifying Person; and

(D)

the Indemnifying Person shall have no liability with respect to any compromise
or settlement of such claims effected without its consent.

(ii)

If the Indemnifying Person does not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim
in the manner and within the period provided in Section 12.5(b), or if the
Indemnifying Person does not diligently conduct the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Person may conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim
at the expense of the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnifying Person shall be
bound by any determination resulting from such Third-Party Claim or any
compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person.

(c)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may
adversely affect it or any of its Affiliates other than as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to relief under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Third-Party
Claim.

(d)

The Parties consent to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a
Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Person for purposes of
determining any claim that an Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement
with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein.

(e)

With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to this Article 12:

(i)

any Indemnified Person and any Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, shall
keep the other Person fully informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim
and any related Proceeding at all stages thereof where such Person is not
represented by its own counsel; and

(ii)

both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be,
shall render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of
each other and shall cooperate in good faith with each other in order to
ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim.


 



(f)

With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to this Article 12, the Parties
shall cooperate in a manner to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the
confidentiality of all Confidential Information and the attorney-client and
work-product privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that:

(i)

it shall use its best efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it
has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of
Confidential Information (consistent with applicable law and rules of
procedure); and

(ii)

all communications between any Party and counsel responsible for or
participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent
possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-
product privilege.

(g)

Any claim under this Article 12 for any matter involving a Third-Party Claim
shall be indemnified, paid, or reimbursed promptly. If the Indemnified Person
shall for any reason assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall reimburse the Indemnified Person on a monthly basis
for the costs of investigation and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Person.

12.6

_Other Claims_. A claim under this Article 12 for any matter not involving a
Third-Party Claim may be made by notice to Seller or Purchaser, as the case
may be, and shall be indemnified, paid, or reimbursed promptly after such
notice.

12.7

_Exclusive Remedy_. If the Closing occurs, the indemnification provided in
this Article 12 will be the sole and exclusive legal remedy for any inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty, or the Breach or default of or under any
covenant or agreement, made by any Party in this Agreement, and no party may
seek any other legal remedy (whether under Securities Laws or otherwise) that
might otherwise be available to such Party; provided, however, that nothing in
this Article 12 will preclude any Party from seeking any legal remedy
available to such Party for any such inaccuracy, Breach or default that
constitutes fraud on the part of any other Party; and provided further,
however, that nothing in this Article 12 will preclude any Party from seeking
any equitable remedy available to such Party for any such inaccuracy, Breach
or default or for any failure by any other Party to comply with any of the
covenants or agreements of such other Party contained herein to be performed
or complied with after the Closing.
