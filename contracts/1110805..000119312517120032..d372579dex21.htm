Statement_ ") indicating Purchasers calculation of Net Working Capital, Net
Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Capital Expenditures Difference, the Owned

(b) Until such time as the Final Closing Date Statement shall become final in
accordance with clause (c) below, Purchaser and the Company shall permit
Seller and its representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the Books and Records and personnel of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to aid in its review of the Closing Date Statement. Seller shall

underlying or utilized in preparing the Closing Date Statement and the
calculation of Purchase Price, Net Working Capital, Net Closing Indebtedness,
the Closing Capital Expenditures Difference and the Owned Crude Value set
forth therein to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the
Closing Date Statement and the calculation of Purchase Price, Net Working
Capital, Net Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Capital Expenditures
Difference and the Owned Crude Value in conformity with this Agreement.

(c) Within thirty (30) calendar days after its receipt of the Closing Date
Statement, Seller shall either inform Purchaser in writing that the Closing
Date Statement is acceptable or object thereto in writing, setting forth in
reasonable detail a description of each of its objections. If Seller so
objects and Purchaser and Seller do not resolve such objections on a mutually
agreeable basis within thirty (30) calendar days after Purchasers receipt of
Sellers objections, the remaining disputed items shall be submitted to
Deloitte LLP or, if Deloitte LLP is not available for such engagement or at
the time of such proposed engagement is no longer independent, such other
nationally recognized independent certified public accounting firm reasonably
agreed to by Purchaser and the Seller (Deloitte LLP or such other accounting
firm agreed to by Purchaser or the Seller or appointed as contemplated by the
succeeding sentence, the " _Accounting Firm_ "). If Purchaser and the
Seller cannot agree on an accounting firm within ten (10) calendar days of
determining that an Accounting Firm other than Deloitte LLP must be appointed
as contemplated by the preceding sentence, then the Purchaser and/or Seller
may submit a request to the American Arbitration Association requesting
appointment of a nationally recognized independent certified public accounting
firm to serve as Accounting Firm. Purchaser and Seller shall direct the
Accounting Firm to resolve such disputed items within thirty (30) calendar
days of submission of the disputed items. Upon the agreement of Purchaser and
Seller, the decision of the Accounting Firm, or if Seller fails to deliver an
objection to Purchaser within the first 30-day period referred to above, then
the Closing Date Statement, as so adjusted (the " _Final Closing Date
Statement_ "), shall be final, conclusive and binding against the parties
hereto. As set forth in the Final Closing Date Statement, the calculation of
the Net Working Capital (" _Final Net Working Capital_ "), Net Closing
Indebtedness (" _Final Net Closing Indebtedness_ "), the Closing Capital
Expenditures Difference (the " _Final Capital Expenditures Difference_ "),
the Owned Crude Value (the " _Final Owned Crude Value_ ") and resulting Final
Purchase Price shall be final for all purposes hereunder.

 



13 (d) In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm (i) shall be bound by
the provisions of this _Section 2.4_, (ii) may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value claimed for such item or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Seller or Purchaser (except to
the extent that the resolution of a disputed items results in a corresponding
change to any other item), (iii) shall limit its decision to such items as are
in dispute and (iv) shall make its determination based solely on presentations
by Seller and Purchaser which are in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of independent
review). The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
allocated by the Accounting Firm between Seller, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount
of the disputed items so submitted to the Accounting Firm are unsuccessfully
disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the Accounting
Firm) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so disputed.

(e) Within two (2) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Purchase Price, Final Net Working Capital, Final Net Closing Indebtedness,
Final Capital Expenditures Difference and Final Owned Crude Value in
accordance with this _Section 2.4_:

 

(i) in the event that the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price, (A) Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Seller, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, payment in an amount equal to
(x) the Final Purchase Price, _minus_ (y) the Estimated Purchase Price and (B)
Purchaser and Seller shall take all actions necessary under the Escrow
Agreement to cause the Escrow Agent to release to Seller all amounts then
contained in the Escrow Account;

 

(ii) in the event that the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase
Price, then Purchaser and Seller shall take all actions necessary under the
Escrow Agreement to cause the Escrow Agent to (x) release to Purchaser from
the Escrow Account an amount equal to (a) the Estimated Purchase Price,
_minus_ (b) the Final Purchase Price (or, if less, the amounts then contained
in the Escrow Account), and (y) release to Seller from the Escrow Account all
amounts remaining in such account, if any, after giving effect to the release
to Purchaser pursuant to the foregoing clause (x).

 

Section 2.5 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in a manner to
be mutually agreed by the Seller and Purchaser in a manner consistent with
Section 1060 of the Code, as amended, and the Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder. Within 120 days of the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller
a draft allocation for Sellers review and approval. Seller and Purchaser
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any issues; provided that any issues
not finally resolved within 60 days of the Closing shall be referred to the
Accounting Firm, whose determination shall be final and binding on the
parties. Seller and Purchaser agree to use the allocations determined pursuant
to this Section 2.5 for all tax purposes, including those matters subject
to Section 1060 of the Code, as amended, and the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless otherwise required by law. The parties shall
amend the final allocation, as necessary and in a manner consistent with the
allocation contained therein, to reflect any differences between the Purchase
Price and the Final Purchase Price, as determined pursuant to _Section 2.4_.

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware
and has the necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of

 



23  this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general equitable principles.

 

Section 4.2 _No Conflicts; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) Assuming expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act, the execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents will not result in (i) any conflict with
the Organizational Documents of Purchaser, (ii) any breach or violation of or
default under, or constitute or give rise to a termination or right
of termination of, acceleration of any obligation or loss of any benefit
under, any contract, mortgage, lease, agreement, deed of trust, indenture or
any other instrument to which Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser or
any of its properties or assets are bound, (iii) a violation of or default
under any Law or Governmental Authorization to which Purchaser is subject or
(iv) the creation or imposition of any Lien, except, in the case of the
foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) as would not, individually or in the

the ability of Purchaser to fulfill its obligations hereunder.

 

(b) Except for the filing of a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act
and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, no
Governmental Authorization of or filing with any Governmental Authority is
required on the part of Purchaser in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (other than
filings made pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

 

Section 4.3 _Financing_. The amount of funds contemplated to be provided
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (as defined below) will be sufficient
to (a) pay the aggregate Purchase Price (including any adjustment amount
pursuant to _Section 2.4_) and other amounts required to be paid pursuant to
_Section 2.3(b)_, (b) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid
by Purchaser and its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including in connection with the Debt

_Sufficient Financing Amount_ "). Purchaser has furnished Seller and the
Company with true, complete and correct copies of (a) the executed and
binding Commitment Letter, dated as of the date hereof among Purchaser and
Mizuho Bank, Ltd. (the " _Debt Financing Sources_ "), pursuant to which the
Debt Financing Sources have committed, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) each
executed fee letter and engagement letter associated therewith that contain
any conditions to funding or

 



24  "flex" provisions or other provisions (as redacted in a customary manner
with respect to fees) (provided that prior to the execution of this Agreement,
Purchaser has advised Seller and the Company of the maximum amount of fees
and expenses payable by Purchaser in connection with the Debt Financing)
regarding the terms and conditions of the financing to be provided by such
commitment letter (such commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments thereto, and each such fee letter and engagement
letter, collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") (the " _Debt
Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified
prior to the date of this Agreement, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated, and the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have
not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Except for the fee letters
and engagement letters referenced above, there are no side letters or other
agreements, Contracts or arrangements related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter delivered to Seller and the Company
prior to the date hereof, and there are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and delivered

is (a) a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and to the

in accordance with its terms against Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, each of the other parties thereto except as may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general equitable principles. No event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party thereto under the
Debt Commitment Letter. All commitments and other fees or expenses required
to be paid under the Debt Commitment Letter prior to the date hereof have been
fully paid. As of the Execution Date, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, there is
no fact or occurrence existing that would make any of the statements
(including assumptions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in
any material respect. As of the date hereof, Purchaser has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the funding of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or
that the Debt Financing will not be made available to Purchaser on or prior to
the Closing Date. In no event shall the receipt or availability of the Debt
Financing or any other funds or financing by Purchaser or any Affiliate or
any other transactions be a condition to any of Purchasers obligations
hereunder.

 

Section 4.4 _Solvency_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3, immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries will be Solvent. No transfer of property is being made
and no obligation is being incurred by or at the direction of Purchaser in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditors of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Solvent_ " when used with respect to the Company, means that, as of any date
of determination from and after the Closing Date, (i) the Present Fair Salable
Value of its assets will, as of such date, exceed all of its liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, as of such date, (ii) the Company will not have, or
have access to, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged and (iii) the 

 



25  Company will be able to pay its debts as they become absolute and mature, in
the ordinary course of business, taking into account the timing of and amounts
of cash to be received by it and the timing of and amounts of cash to be
payable on or in respect of its indebtedness, in each case after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of the
definition of "Solvent" (A) "debt" means liability on a "claim"; and (B)
"claim" means (x) any right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced
to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured or (y) the right to an equitable
remedy for a breach in performance if such breach gives rise to a right to
payment, whether or not such equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,
liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. " _Present Fair Salable
Value_ " means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of the
Company (including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable
promptness in an arms-length transaction under present conditions for the
sale of comparable business enterprises.

 

Section 4.5 _Litigation_. As of the Execution Date, there is no Litigation
pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, which questions the
validity of this Agreement or any action taken or to be taken by Purchaser in
connection herewith which would materially impair or delay Purchasers ability
to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with the terms hereof.

Section 4.6 _Purchase for Investment_. Purchaser is acquiring the Transferred
Interests for investment and not with a view toward, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any resale or public distribution thereof in violation of the
U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state or non-U.S. Law of
similar effect. Purchaser acknowledges that the Transferred Interests will not
be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state
or non-U.S. Law of similar effect.

 

Section 4.7 _Brokers_. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates has
entered, directly or indirectly, into any Contract or arrangement with any
Person that would obligate Seller to pay any commission, brokerage or
"finders fee" or other fee in connection with this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 4.8 _No Knowledge of Representations or Omissions_. To the Knowledge
of Purchaser, there are no representations and warranties of Seller in this
Agreement that are not true and correct in all material respects, and
Purchaser has no Knowledge of any material errors in, or material omissions
from, the Seller Disclosure Schedules, or any other Schedules.

Section 4.9 _Purchaser s Examination_. Purchaser has been given adequate
opportunity to examine all documents provided by, conduct due diligence and
ask questions of, and to receive answers from, Seller and its representatives
concerning the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and the business, assets,
properties and liabilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
Purchasers investment in the Transferred Interests, and Purchaser has
completed its own independent investigation, analysis and evaluation of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and the business, assets, properties and
liabilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as it deemed necessary
or appropriate.

(a) Subject to applicable Law or any applicable Governmental Authorizations,
from the Execution Date until the Closing Date Seller shall, during
reasonable business hours and in compliance with such reasonable procedures as
Seller may request, provide Purchaser and its representatives (including the
Replacement Financing Sources and their representatives) with access to
such information, documents and properties as are in its possession or under
its control relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as Purchaser
may reasonably request in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided that such access shall be supervised by such Persons
as may be designated by Seller and such access shall not (i) unreasonably
disrupt the operations of Seller, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
(ii) require that any of Seller, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
disclose any information that in Sellers reasonable judgment would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets or violate any of Sellers, the Companys
or the Company Subsidiaries obligations with respect to

 



29  confidentiality, (iii) require that any of Seller, the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries disclose any legally privileged information of any of
Seller, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (iv) require Seller or its
Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to disclose
any financial or proprietary information of or regarding Seller or its
Affiliates (excluding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) or otherwise
disclose information regarding Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries) which Seller deems commercially sensitive, or
(v) include any boring, drilling or other invasive or destructive testing or
sampling. All information, data and copies of documents obtained by Purchaser
shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as if Purchaser
were a party thereto.

 

(b) If Purchaser exercises rights of access to any assets or properties owned,
leased, used or managed by the Company Group under this  _Section 5.3_ or
otherwise, or conducts examinations or physical inspections at sites under
this _Section 5.3_ or otherwise, then (i) such access and any related
examinations or inspections shall be at Purchasers sole risk, cost and
expense and Purchaser waives and releases all claims against Seller, the
Company Group and their Affiliates arising in any way therefrom or in any way
related thereto; and (ii) Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller, the Company Group and their Affiliates from any and all
claims, actions, causes of action, liabilities, losses, damages, fines,
penalties, costs or expenses of any kind or character, or Liens for labor or
materials, arising out of or related to property damage or personal injury
caused by, or personal injury to, Purchasers representatives and invitees
during the course of any such examinations or inspections. THE FOREGOING
RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS,
CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF
(i) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE) OF SELLER, THE COMPANY OR ANY
COMPANY SUBSIDIARY OR (ii) STRICT LIABILITY.

Section 5.4 _Publicity_. Prior to the Closing Date, no press release or
public announcement related to this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued or made without the joint approval of
Seller and Purchaser, unless required by applicable Law (in the reasonable
opinion of counsel), in which case Seller and Purchaser shall have the right
to review such press release or announcement prior to publication.

 

Section 5.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Debt Financing
is not a condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt
Financing is not available, Purchaser shall continue to be obligated, subject
to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions to the obligation of Purchaser
set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_, to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Purchaser shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including (i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment
Letter, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to

 



30  Purchaser obtaining the Debt Financing and complying with its obligations in
the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) entering into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions in the Debt Commitment
Letter), (iv) obtaining such third-party consents as may be reasonably
required in connection with the Debt Financing and (v) consummating the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing (including by taking enforcement actions
against the Debt Financing Sources and other Persons providing the Debt
Financing, including through litigation). Purchaser shall not agree to or
permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its
rights under, the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related
to the Debt Financing, in each case, without Sellers prior written consent,
except to correct typographical errors, provide for the assignment of a
portion of the Debt Commitment Letter to additional agents or arrangers or to
reallocate commitments or assign or reassign titles or roles to, or between
or among, any entities party thereto. Purchaser shall promptly upon execution
deliver to Seller copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement,
modification or waiver. Upon any such amendment, supplement or modification of
the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section 5.5_, the term "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall mean the Debt Commitment Letter as so
amended, supplemented or modified. Without limiting any of the foregoing
obligations of Purchaser except as set forth below, it is understood that
Purchaser shall be entitled to seek equity or debt financing from alternative
sources the proceeds of which may be used in lieu of the Debt Financing to
finance all or a portion of the Sufficient Financing Amount so long as any
such proceeds obtained prior to the Closing Date are used to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Replacement Financing_ ")
or used prior to the Closing to repay outstanding amounts under Purchasers
existing revolving credit facility so long as Purchaser has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the drawdowns of such revolving credit
facility would not be satisfied as of the Closing and Purchaser will have
capacity under such revolving credit facility to redraw any such amounts at
the Closing to the extent necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent Purchaser obtains and uses
the proceeds of such Replacement Financing to pay all of the payments set
forth in _Section 2.2_ and any adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and any
other amounts required to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_,
Purchaser shall be relieved of its obligation under _Section 5.5(b)(v)_ to
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing to the extent the
Debt Financing is not necessary for the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter for any reason, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event but no later than the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the obligation of Purchaser set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.3_, alternative financing from alternative sources (the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount equal to the Sufficient Financing
Amount, which would not involve terms that are materially less favorable to
Purchaser, would not involve any conditions to funding the Debt Financing that
are not contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, would not reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and would not adversely
impact the ability of Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise
adversely impact the Seller. The obligations under this _Section 5.5_ shall
apply equally to any such Alternative Financing (including any new financing
commitment).

 



31 (d) Purchaser shall keep Seller and the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing or Replacement Financing) and
provide to Seller and the Company copies of all documents related to the Debt
Financing (or Alternative Financing or Replacement Financing). Purchaser
shall allow Seller and the Company to reasonably consult with the providers of
the Debt Financing (and Alternative Financing or Replacement Financing) on the
status of such financing (provided that Purchaser shall have the right to
have one or more representatives present during any such consultation) and
provide Seller and the Company, upon reasonable request, with such information
and documentation as shall be reasonably necessary to allow Seller and
the Company to monitor the progress of such financing activities. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall give Seller and the
Company prompt written notice (i) of any actual or purported breach, default,
repudiation, cancellation or termination (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
give rise to such breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination)
by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter (or commitments for any
Alternative Financing or Replacement Financing) or definitive documents
relating to the Debt Financing (or any Alternative Financing or Replacement
Financing) of which Purchaser becomes aware or any termination of the Debt
Commitment Letter (or commitments for any Alternative Financing or Replacement
Financing), (ii) if for any reason Purchaser believes in good faith that there
is a possibility that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Debt Financing (or any Alternative Financing or Replacement Financing) on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (and any equivalent documents for any Alternative Financing
or Replacement Financing) or the definitive documents related to the Debt
Financing (and any equivalent documents for any Alternative Financing or
Replacement Financing), (iii) if for any reason Purchaser believes in good
faith that there is a possibility that it will not be able satisfy the
conditions necessary to obtain the Sufficient Financing Amount under the Debt
Commitment Letters (or any equivalent documents for any Alternative Financing
or Replacement Financing) or (iv) any reduction in the amount of the
commitments under the Debt Commitment Letters (or any equivalent documents for
any Alternative Financing or Replacement Financing). The Purchaser will not
consent to any assignment of rights or obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letters (or any equivalent documents for any Alternative Financing or
Replacement Financing) without the prior written approval of the Seller, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

constitute an amendment to any Plan or any other plan or arrangement covering
employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (as applicable, the " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing, an officer or
director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement with the approval of the DandO Indemnifying Party
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, based in whole or in
part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring prior to the Closing or
any acts or omissions occurring or existing prior to the Closing and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Closing, in each
such case, to the same extent such DandO Indemnified Parties are entitled
thereto as of the date hereof. Furthermore, the current provisions in the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries respective Organizational Documents
with respect to exculpation of director and officer liability and
indemnification shall not be amended for six years following the Closing if
such amendment would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who at any time prior to the Closing were directors or officers of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in respect of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing.

 



36 (b) For a period of six years after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to maintain in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries; provided that Purchaser may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to the DandO Indemnified Parties
with respect to matters arising before and acts or omissions occurring or
existing at or prior to the Closing; provided, further, that the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in
excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid for such insurance.
Purchaser may satisfy its obligations under this  _Section 6.7(b)_ by
purchasing a "tail" policy which (i) has an effective term of six years from
the Closing, (ii) covers each person currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing, and
(iii) contains terms that are no less favorable than those of the Companys
directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

(c) In the event that, following the Closing, the Purchaser or the Company or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or merges with
or into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Purchaser or the Company shall assume and succeed to all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 6.7_. In addition, following
the Closing, the Purchaser and the Company shall not distribute, sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of their assets in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to render the Purchaser or the Company unable to
satisfy their obligations under this _Section 6.7_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party, his or her heirs
and his or her personal representatives and shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Purchaser, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 6.8 _Post-Closing Access_. In connection with any matter relating to
any period prior to, or any period ending on, the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, upon the request and at the expense of Seller, permit Seller and its
representatives reasonable access at all reasonable times to the Books and
Records transferred to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall execute and shall cause
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to execute such documents as Seller
may reasonably request to enable Seller to prepare and/or file any reports or
Tax Returns required of Seller and/or any of Sellers Affiliates, if any,
relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or for Seller to
fulfill any post-Closing Obligations hereunder. Purchaser shall not dispose of
such Books and Records during the seven (7)-year period beginning with the
Closing Date without Sellers consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



37 Section 6.9 _Name Change; Use of Name_. Purchaser shall change the name of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries within 60 days following the Closing
Date to exclude the word "Navigator", and shall cease using such name after
such time. On and prior to the date that is 60 days following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall have a nonexclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable
license to continue using such name, in a manner consistent with past practice
and transitional "phase out" use.

 

Section 6.10 _Transition Matters_.

 

(a) From time to time prior to Closing, but in no event later than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser may deliver to Seller a
notice providing the name or names of any current Employee(s) (each such
Employee, a "Terminated Employee") to be terminated effective upon the
Closing, and Seller shall, subject to compliance with applicable Law, cause
the employment of such Terminated Employees to be terminated effective upon
the Closing. If any such Terminated Employee has previously executed a
Transition Services Letter, Seller shall cause such Transition Services Letter
to be terminated effective upon the Closing.

(b) From time to time prior to the Closing, but in no event later than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser may deliver to Seller a
notice providing the name or names of any current Employee(s) (each such
Employee, a "Targeted Employee") that Purchaser has identified for the
execution of a Transition Services Letter. Seller shall then request that the
Targeted Employee enter into a Transition Services Letter with the Company on
or prior to Closing.

"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set
forth therein), (except that representations and warranties that are made as
of a specified date need be true and correct in all material respects only as
of such date) and (iii) set forth in _Section 3.6(c)(ii)_ shall be true and
correct in all respects as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing
Date.

 

(b) Seller shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all
agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it prior to the Closing Date; provided that, with respect to
agreements, covenants and conditions that are qualified by materiality, Seller
shall have performed such agreements and covenants in all respects.

Date and signed by a senior executive officer as to the fulfillment of the

such Party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 9

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 9.1 _Non-Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants
or other agreements in this Agreement or any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements, shall survive
Closing, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein and
therein that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part after
Closing and this _Article 9_.

 



40 Section 9.2 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all actions, causes
of action, claims, cross-claims, third-party claims or Litigation of any kind
(whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement (including the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto), any certificate, instrument, opinion or other
documents delivered hereunder, or the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof or thereof (including any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim,
third-party claim or Litigation of any kind based upon, arising out of or
related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection herewith or
therewith) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws; provided that the Debt
Financing and all actions (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to the Debt
Financing, or the negotiation, execution or performance of any documentation
(including the Debt Commitment Letter) in connection therewith shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
(except as expressly specified otherwise in the Debt Commitment Letter or in
any definitive document related to the Debt Financing).

Section 9.3 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits, for itself and its property, to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State
of Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Litigation of any kind
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any certificate, instrument,
opinion or other documents delivered hereunder, or the negotiation, execution
or performance hereof or thereof (including any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Litigation of any kind based upon,
arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection herewith or therewith), or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Litigation of any kind
shall be heard and determined in such Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in the State of Delaware), (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim or Litigation of any kind arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any certificate, instrument, opinion or other documents delivered
hereunder, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof
(including any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim or Litigation of any kind based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection herewith or therewith) in
the Delaware Court of Chancery, any Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in the State of Delaware, or in any Delaware State court,
(iii) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim or Litigation of any kind in any such court
and (iv) agrees that a final judgment in any such action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Litigation of any kind shall be
conclusive and

 



41  may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto agrees that service
of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at
the applicable address set forth in _Section 9.11_ below shall be effective
service of process for any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim or Litigation of any kind brought in any such court.

(b) Each of the parties agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Litigation of any
kind (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction
is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), and makes the
agreements, waivers and consents set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ _mutatis
mutandis_ but with respect to the courts specified in this _Section 9.3(b)_.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE
DEBT FINANCING).

 

Section 9.4 _Remedies_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
(including by requiring Purchaser to file one or more lawsuits against the
Debt Financing Sources to fully enforce the Debt Financing Sources
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the Party seeking
the injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief has an
adequate remedy of Law. The remedies available to each Party pursuant to this
_Section 9.4_ shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is
entitled at Law or in equity. To the extent any party hereto brings any action
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than an action solely to specifically enforce any provision
that expressly survives termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.2_ hereof) when available to such party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the
amount of time during which such action is pending, plus 20 Business Days, or
(ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action.

 



42 Section 9.5 _Modification; Waiver_. This Agreement may be modified only by a
written instrument executed by the Parties hereto. Any of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement may be waived in writing (subject to applicable
Law) at any time on or prior to the Closing Date by the Party entitled to the
benefits thereof. To the extent any amendment, modification or supplement to
_Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_, this _Section 9.5_ or _Section 9.9_ is
sought which is adverse to the rights of any Debt Financing Source, the
prior written consent of such Debt Financing Source shall be required before
such amendment, modification or supplement is effective.

 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, oral or written,
express or implied, between the Parties hereto and their respective
Affiliates, representatives and agents in respect of the subject matter
hereof, except that this Agreement does not supersede the Confidentiality
Agreement, the terms and conditions of which the Parties hereto expressly
reaffirm.

 

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is found to be, by competent authority with jurisdiction, invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties hereto as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible. 

Section 9.8 _Expenses_. Except as expressly provided herein to the contrary,
whether or not the transactions contemplated herein shall be consummated,
each Party shall pay its own expenses incident to the preparation and
performance of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.9 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and its successors and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement; provided that: (i) the Debt Financing
Sources shall be considered third party beneficiaries with respect to _Section
9.2_, _Section 9.3_, _Section 9.5_ and this sentence of _Section 9.9_, (ii)
the DandO Indemnified Parties shall be considered third party beneficiaries of
_Section 6.7_, (iii) the Seller Related Parties shall be considered third
party beneficiaries of _Section 6.4_, (iv) the Non-Party Affiliates shall be
considered third party beneficiaries of _Section 9.18_ and (v) _ST andB_
shall be considered a third party beneficiary of _Section 9.19_, and, in each
case, such parties shall have the right to enforce such Sections.

 

Section 9.10 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the
part of any Party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair
such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further
exercise thereof, or of any other right.

 



43 Section 9.11 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been duly given or made as follows: (i) if sent by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, upon receipt; (ii) if sent by
reputable overnight air courier (such as DHL or Federal Express), upon

the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, provided that any assignment, by operation of law or
otherwise, by a Party hereto shall require the prior written consent of the
other Party and any purported assignment or other transfer without such
consent shall be void and unenforceable.

Section 9.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. Any matter disclosed by Seller in the
Seller Disclosure Schedules pursuant to any Section of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been disclosed by Seller for purposes of each other Section of
this Agreement to which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably
apparent on its face.

Party punitive, exemplary, treble, special, indirect, consequential, remote or

such action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is
required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day which is a
Business Day.

supplement or other modification hereto or waiver hereunder, (i) may be
executed in any number of counterparts (including by means of facsimile or
email in .pdf format), each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to

signed version thereof delivered in person.

Section 9.17  _Interpretation_. The section headings in this Agreement are
for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect
the meaning or interpretation of any provision hereof. The disclosure of any
matter in the Schedules hereto shall be deemed to be a disclosure for all
purposes of this Agreement to which such matter could reasonably be likely to
be pertinent, but shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by
Seller or Purchaser, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material
for the purposes of this Agreement.

Section 9.18 _No Recourse_. Except as expressly set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, all claims, obligations,
liabilities, or causes of action (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or
by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and such representations and
warranties are those solely of) the Parties. No Person who is not a Party,
including any current, former or future equityholder, 

 



45  incorporator, controlling person, general or limited partner, member,
Affiliate, assignee or representative of any Party, or any current, former or
future equityholder, incorporator, controlling person, general or limited
partner, Affiliate, assignee or representative of any of the foregoing or any
of their respective successors, predecessors or assigns (or any successors,
predecessors or assigns of the foregoing) (collectively, the " _Non-Party
Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in Law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach
(other than as expressly set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement), and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each Party
hereby waives and releases all claims, causes of action, obligations, or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than as
expressly set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement or the Escrow Agreement)
against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, except to the extent otherwise expressly set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (a) each Party
hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of
action that may otherwise be available, whether at Law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a
Party or otherwise impose liability of a Party on any Non-Party Affiliate,
whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise, in each case
arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this
Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its
negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than as expressly set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement or the Escrow Agreement); and (b) each
Party disclaims any reliance upon any Non-Party Affiliates with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein or otherwise, after the Closing, no
party may seek to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 9.19 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. Purchaser (on its
behalf and, from and after the Closing, on behalf of the Company Group)
hereby waives, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that
may arise in connection with STandB representing the Seller or any Seller
Related Party after the Closing as such representation may relate to
Purchaser, the Company Group or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Purchaser (on its behalf and, from and after the Closing, on behalf
of the Company Group) hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between the Purchaser or the Company Group, on the one
hand, and Seller or any Seller Related Party, on the other hand, STandB may
represent any or all of Seller or any Seller Related Party in such dispute
even though the interests of Seller or the Seller Related Parties may be
directly adverse to Purchaser, the Company Group or any of their respective
Affiliates, and even though STandB formerly may have represented the Company
Group in a matter substantially related to such dispute. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences by Seller, the Company
Group or the Seller Related Parties in the course of the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to Seller and
the Seller Related Parties (and not Purchaser or the Company Group).
Accordingly,

 



46  Purchaser and the Company Group shall not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of STandB relating to the engagement described
in this _Section 9.19_, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(i) Seller and the Seller Related Parties (and not Purchaser, the Company
Group or their respective Affiliates) shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of Seller,
the Company Group or their respective Affiliates shall be a holder thereof,
(ii) to the extent that the files of STandB in respect of such engagement
constitute property of the client, only Seller and the Seller Related Parties
(and not Purchaser, the Company Group or their respective Affiliates) shall
hold such property rights and (iii) STandB shall have no duty whatsoever
to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to
Purchaser, the Company Group or their respective Affiliates by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between STandB and any of Purchaser, the Company
Group or their respective Affiliates or otherwise.

Section 9.20 _Guarantee_. To induce Seller to enter into this
Agreement, Guarantor, intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Seller the due and punctual
performance, payment and discharge (and not merely collection) of all
obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement, including payment of the
aggregate Purchase Price (including any adjustment amount pursuant to _Section
2.4_) and other amounts required to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.3(b))_
when due and payable hereunder.
