 _THE MERGER_  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue its corporate existence under Delaware law as the 

      ##### 

  

    

surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

   

 Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, NY at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by action taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. 

   

 Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub shall file the certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the DGCL. 

   

 Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 5.12. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in Section 5.12. 

   

 Section 1.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

       ##### 

  

     

 Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

   

 Section 1.8 _Alternative Structures_. The parties agree to reasonably cooperate in the consideration and implementation of alternative structures to effect the business combination contemplated by this Agreement, as long as any such alternative structure does not (a) impose any material delay on, or condition to, the consummation of the Merger, (b) cause any condition set forth in Article VI to not be capable of being satisfied (unless duly waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof), or (c) adversely affect any of the parties hereto or either of the parties stockholders. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_  

  

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.1(b) and 2.1(d), each issued and outstanding share of common stock (including the Reserved Shares and together with the preferred share purchase rights (the " _Company Rights_ ") granted pursuant to the Company Rights Agreement), par value $.01 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares, collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_ "), other than any Cancelled Shares shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive 2.835 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), including the preferred share purchase rights (the " _Parent Rights_ ") granted pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated January 15, 2001, between Parent and The Chase Manhattan Bank as Rights Agent (the " _Parent Rights Agreement_ "), of Parent (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), all to be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Shares in accordance with Section 2.2(b). 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Share that is owned directly or indirectly by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time or held directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than the Reserved Shares and any other Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (d) _Fractional Shares_. 

    

 (i) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(d), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock representing such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(a) over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(b) (such excess, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") in the manner provided in the following paragraph. 

   

 (ii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of Shares would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Shares would otherwise be entitled. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of shares of Parent Common Stock without interest, subject to and in accordance with Section 2.2. 

  

 (e) _Adjustments to the Exchange Ratio_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to provide to Parent, Merger Sub and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and thereafter, all references in this Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio" shall be references to the Exchange Ratio as so adjusted;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 2.1(e) shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the issuance or distribution of Reserved Shares shall not give rise to any adjustment under the terms of this Section 2.1(e). 

   

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Shares for the Merger Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, the Restricted Shares and the Company RSUs, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued). Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). All certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock (including the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d)) are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second business day following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of Shares, which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Shares in exchange for certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued), cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(d) 

      ##### 

  

    

and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c).
Upon surrender of Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Shares surrendered by such
holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 (which shall
be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested), payment by cash or check in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(d) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c),
and the Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of
the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a person other
than the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Share is registered,
it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered
Share be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
delivery of the Merger Consideration pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required as a result of such registration in the name of a person other than
the registered holder of such Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c)) upon such surrender. No interest shall be
paid or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or
Section 2.2(c). 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Share, there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to this Article II, together with any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Restricted Shares or Company RSUs, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or holder of the Restricted Shares or Company RSUs, in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer Books_. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II and any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c) shall be deemed to have been issued (or paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Shares. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Parents disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

officer, employee or service provider of Parent or its Affiliates is entitled
to a gross-up, make-whole or indemnification payment with respect to taxes
imposed under Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

The Joint Proxy Statement (other than the portion thereof relating solely to the Company Stockholders Meeting) and the Form S-4 (other than the portion thereof based on information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein, with respect to which no representation is made by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 Section 4.13 _Regulatory Matters_. 

   

 (a) Each of Parents Subsidiaries that engages in the sale of electricity at wholesale is regulated as a "public utility" under the FPA and has been authorized by the FERC, pursuant to the FPA, to make such sales at market-based rates.

There are no pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, judicial or administrative proceedings to revoke a Subsidiarys market-based rate authorization or Exempt Wholesale Generator status, as applicable. To the knowledge of Parent, there are no facts that are reasonably likely to cause any of Parents Subsidiaries that sell electricity at wholesale to lose its market-based rate authorization or any of Parents Subsidiaries that directly own generating facilities to lose its status as an Exempt Wholesale Generator under PUHCA. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries owns, directly or indirectly, any interest in any nuclear generation station or manages or operates any nuclear generation station.

 (a) Except for this Agreement, the Parent Benefit Plans and agreements filed as exhibits to the Parent SEC Documents, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by: 

    

 (i) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC); 

   

 (ii) any coal supply agreement, coal transportation agreement, construction agreement, power purchase or offtake agreement or fuel purchase agreement that is material to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

 (iv) any contract (A) with an aggregate principal amount, or providing for an aggregate obligation, in excess of $50 million (1) evidencing Indebtedness of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party, (2) guaranteeing any such Indebtedness of a third party or (3) containing a covenant restricting the payment of dividends, or (B) having the economic effect of any of the items set forth in subclause (A) above.

Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action or knows of any fact that is reasonably likely to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

 Section 4.25 _Lack of Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns directly or indirectly, any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for shares of 

      ##### 

  

    

Company Common Stock or any securities of any Subsidiary of the Company, and

Shares except pursuant to this Agreement. There are no voting trusts or other

 (i) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of the Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, vest and be converted into an option (a " _Parent Stock Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions (except as provided in this Section 5.8(a)(i)) as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, to purchase that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. The per-share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Parent Stock Options will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which the Company Stock Options were exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting per-share exercise price up to the nearest whole cent. 

   

 (ii) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest and be converted into, in accordance with Section 2.1 a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional  shares) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such grant of Restricted Shares and (B) the Exchange Ratio. 

   

 (iii) Effective as of the Effective Time, each award of restricted share units or phantom shares with respect to shares of Company Common Stock under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company RSUs_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or free of conditions to payment, vest and automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted, into the right to receive from Parent, at the Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid by the Surviving Corporation to the holder) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such grant of Company RSUs and (B) the Exchange Ratio;  _provided_ , _that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that a holder of a Company RSU has made a valid deferral election 

   ##### 

  

    

with respect to such Company RSU, the settlement of such Company RSU shall be
governed by the terms of such deferral election. 

   

 (iv) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.8(a). 

  

 (b) _Employee Matters_. 

    

 (i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company Benefit Plans and Parent Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time and shall assume as of the Effective Time the agreements identified in Section 5.8(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, _provided_ that nothing herein shall prohibit Parent from amending or terminating any such Company Benefit Plans, Parent Benefit Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or from terminating the employment of any Company Employee or Parent Employee to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the Company Benefit Plans and the Parent Benefit Plans with a view towards developing appropriate new Benefit Plans for Newco Employees. It is the intention of Parent and the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, to (x) develop new Benefit Plans, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, which, among other things, (A) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location, tenure, qualifications and abilities and (B) do not discriminate between Newco Employees who were covered by Company Benefit Plans, on the one hand, and those covered by Parent Benefit Plans on the other, at the Effective Time and (y) to provide to similarly situated Newco Employees following the Effective Time base salaries and wage rates and cash bonus opportunities on a substantially equivalent basis and in a manner that does not discriminate between Newco Employees who were Parent employees, on the one hand, and those who were Company employees on the other, at the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Benefit Plans_ " means, with respect to any entity, any compensation or employee benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements or other arrangements, whether or not "employee benefit plans" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), whether or not subject to ERISA), including, without limitation, bonus, cash- or equity-based incentive, deferred compensation, stock purchase, health, medical, dental, disability, accident, life insurance, or vacation, paid time off, perquisite, fringe benefit, severance, change of control, retention, employment, separation, retirement, pension, or savings, plans, programs, policies, agreements or arrangements, that are sponsored, maintained or contributed by 

   ##### 

  

    

such entity or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of current or former
directors, officers or employees of such entity or any of its Subsidiaries or
any dependant or beneficiary thereof. 

   

 (iii) With respect to any Benefit Plans in which any Newco Employees who are employees of the Company or Parent (or their Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which such Newco Employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall: (A) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Newco Employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, as the case may be; (B) provide each Newco Employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time; and (C) recognize all service of the Newco Employees with Parent and the Company, and their respective affiliates, for all purposes (including, purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit, entitlement to benefits, and, except with respect to defined benefit pension plans, benefit accrual) in any New Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, including any severance plan, to the extent such service is taken into account under the applicable New Plan; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits. 

   

 (iv) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.10, the provisions of this Section 5.8(b) are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Parent Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.
