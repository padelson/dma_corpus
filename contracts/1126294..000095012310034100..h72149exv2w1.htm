lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions
of this Section&nbsp;2.1(d), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common
Stock representing such holder&#146;s proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the
sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such
sale) in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of
(A)&nbsp;the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange
Agent by Parent pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(a) over (B)&nbsp;the aggregate number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(b)
(such excess, the &#147;<U>Excess Shares</U>&#148;). The parties acknowledge that payment of the
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for
purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused
by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Shares that would
otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at
then prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (the &#147;<U>NYSE</U>&#148;) in the manner
provided in the following paragraph.

Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, shall be
executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust
for the holders of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock (the &#147;<U>Common Shares Trust</U>&#148;). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion
of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of Shares shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such holder of Shares would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Shares would
otherwise be entitled.

with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii)&nbsp;at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent

otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Restricted Shares or
Company RSUs, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such
withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares or holder of the Restricted Shares or Company RSUs, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.
