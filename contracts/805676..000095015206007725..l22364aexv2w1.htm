Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the
Park Regulations, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the regulations of
the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable Law. At the Effective Time,
the individuals serving as directors of Park immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become

of Park; <I>provided, however, </I>that Park shall, subject to the requirements of applicable Law and the
provisions of the Governing Documents of Park, take all actions necessary to cause J. Daniel

as a director of the Surviving Corporation in the class of directors whose terms expire at the
annual meeting of the shareholders of the Surviving Corporation to be held in 2009. Each director
of the Surviving Corporation shall serve as such until his or her successor is duly elected and
qualified in the manner provided in the articles of incorporation and regulations of the Surviving
Corporation or as otherwise provided by applicable Law or until his or her earlier death,
resignation or removal in the manner provided in the articles of incorporation and regulations of
the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by applicable Law. At the Effective Time, each
individual who is an officer of Park immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become an
officer of the Surviving Corporation holding the same office in the Surviving Corporation, in
accordance with the regulations thereof, as held with Park immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Park may at any time prior to the Effective Time change the method of effecting the Merger
(including, without limitation, the provisions of this Article&nbsp;II) if and to the extent Park deems
such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; <I>provided, however</I>, that no such change shall
(i)&nbsp;alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be issued to holders of Vision

its sole discretion, shall determine that the Continuing Employees shall, subject to applicable
eligibility requirements, participate in employee benefit plans of Park or a Subsidiary of Park,
and that some or all of the Compensation and Benefit Plans shall be frozen, terminated or merged
into certain employee benefit plans of Park or one of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Continuing Employee shall be credited
with years of service with Vision Bancshares, the appropriate Vision Bancshares Subsidiary and, to
the extent credit would have been given by Vision Bancshares or the appropriate Vision Bancshares
Subsidiary for years of service with a predecessor (including any business organization acquired by
Vision Bancshares or any Vision Bancshares Subsidiary), of Vision Bancshares or any Vision
Bancshares Subsidiary, for purposes of entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits
and vacation entitlement, eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (but not for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit pension plan) in the employee benefit plans of Park. Service
with Vision Bancshares and the appropriate Vision Bancshares Subsidiary shall apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any
pre-existing condition limitations with respect to any Park employee benefit plan that is a group
health plan. Each Park employee benefit plan that is a group health plan shall waive pre-existing
condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable Vision Bancshares Compensation
and Benefit Plan that is a group health plan. Continuing Employees shall be given credit for
amounts paid under a corresponding group health plan during the same period for purposes of
applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Park group health plan. Park shall, before the
Effective Time, adopt resolutions that amend its employee benefit plans to provide for the Vision
Bancshares or Vision Bancshares Subsidiary service credits referenced herein.
