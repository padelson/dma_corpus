 (ii) $25.00 in cash for each share of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to this election and owned by the holder thereof as of the Effective Time (the " _ _Cash Election__ ").

Bancshares Common Stock shall be permitted to make any combination of the
Stock Election and the Cash Election in whole share increments with respect

fractional Park Common Shares in accordance with Section 3.04, 50% of the
shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the

rights pursuant to Article 13 of the Alabama Code as having made the
Cash Election).  
---|---|--- 
   

   

 (ii) In the event that holders of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock representing more than 50% of the total number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time make the Cash Election and exercise dissenters rights pursuant to Article 13 of the Alabama Code with respect to such shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock, a number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the Cash Election shall be converted to shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the Stock Election so that the total number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the Cash Election and with respect to which dissenters rights have been exercised pursuant to Article 13 of the Alabama Code is equal to 50% of the total number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Except with respect to holders of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock who exercise dissenters rights pursuant to Article 13 of the Alabama Code, each holder of Vision Bancshares Common Stock that has made the Cash Election shall be subject to this conversion with respect to a number of such holders shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the Cash Election equal to the product of: (A) the total number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the conversion from the Cash Election to the Stock Election (which number shall exclude shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock as to which the holders have exercised dissenters rights pursuant to Article 13 of the Alabama Code),

Vision Bancshares Common Stock as to which the holders have exercised
dissenters rights pursuant to Article 13 of the Alabama Code). 

   

 (iii) In the event that holders of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock representing more than 50% of the total number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time make the Stock Election, a number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the Stock Election shall be converted to shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the Cash Election so that the total number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the Stock Election (including shares of Vision Bancshares ISO Common Stock as to which the holders have made a separate Stock Election as provided in Section 3.02(g)) is equal to 50% of the total number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Except with respect to holders of Vision Bancshares ISO Common Stock who make a separate Stock Election with respect to such shares as provided in Section 3.02(g), each holder of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock that has made the Stock Election shall be subject to this conversion with respect to a number of such holders shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the Stock Election equal to the product of: (A) the total number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the conversion from the Stock Election to the Cash Election (which number shall exclude shares of Vision Bancshares ISO Common Stock as to which the holders have made a separate Stock Election as provided in Section 3.02(g)), multiplied by (B) the ratio of (1) the number of such holders shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock subject to the Stock Election, divided by (2) the total number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock as to which the holders have made the Stock Election (which number shall exclude shares of Vision Bancshares ISO Common Stock as to which the holders have made a separate Stock Election as provided in Section 3.02(g)).

Nothing contained in this Section 3.02(g) shall be interpreted or construed to prevent any holder of Vision Bancshares ISO Common Stock from making the Election described in Section 3.02(d) with respect to any share of Vision Bancshares Common Stock which is not a share of Vision Bancshares ISO Common Stock. Certificates 

   ##### 

  

    

representing shares of Vision Bancshares ISO Common Stock shall be marked with
a legend indicating their status as shares of Vision Bancshares ISO Common
Stock. 

  

 (h) _ _No Election__. Any holder of Vision Bancshares Common Stock as of the Effective Time who does not submit a properly completed and signed Election Form/Letter of Transmittal that is received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline, will be deemed to have made an election under Section 3.01(a) for all purposes herein for that form of Merger Consideration as to which less than 50% of the total number of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock has been made. Park will have the discretion to disregard immaterial defects in an Election Form/Letter of Transmittal. If Park or its designee reasonably determines that any purported Stock Election or Cash Election was not properly made, such purported Election will be deemed to be of no force and effect and the holder making such Election will be deemed to have made an election in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 3.02(h). 

  

 3.03 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist and holders of Vision Bancshares Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Vision Bancshares, other than to receive the Merger Consideration provided under this Article III and dissenters rights under Article 13 of the Alabama Code in the case of Vision Bancshares Dissenting Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Vision Bancshares or the Surviving Corporation of any shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock (other than Vision Bancshares Dissenting Shares, if applicable). 

  

 3.04 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional Park Common Shares and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger and no Park dividend or other distribution or stock split or combination will relate to any fractional Park Common Share, and such fractional Park Common Shares will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder of Park. Instead, Park shall pay to each holder of Vision Bancshares Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional Park Common Share (after taking into account all Old Certificates delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fractional Park Common Share to which the holder would be entitled by the Park Exchange Value. 

  

 3.05 _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a) _ _Establishment of Exchange Fund__. The First-Knox National Bank of Mount Vernon, Mount Vernon, Ohio will act as agent (the " _ _Exchange Agent__ ") for purposes of conducting the exchange and payment procedures as described in this Article III. Park shall provide to the Exchange Agent the aggregate number of Park Common Shares issuable pursuant to Section 3.01(a), the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to Sections 3.01(a), 3.01(b) and 3.04 and the amount of all other cash payable in respect of the Merger, if any, on an "as needed" basis to the Exchange Agent, all of which shall be held by the Exchange Agent in trust for the holders of Vision Bancshares Common Stock (collectively, the " _ _Exchange Fund__ "). The Exchange Agent shall distribute Park Common Shares and make payment of such cash as provided herein. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Park Common Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold in trust for the recipients of Park Common Shares until distributed thereto pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such Park Common Shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as set forth in this Section 3.05. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _ _No Interest__. No interest will be paid on any cash, including any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional Park Common Shares or in respect of dividends or distributions, that any Person shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this Article Three. 

  

 (c) _ _Surrender Procedures__. Promptly after the Effective Time, Park shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate representing shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock (an " _ _Old Certificate__ ") that was converted pursuant to Section 3.02, but that was not deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.02(d), both (i) a form of letter of transmittal (the " _ _Letter of Transmittal__ ") specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions and procedures for surrendering Old Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Park Common Shares (" _ _New Certificates__ "). Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, following the Effective Time, the holder of such Old Certificate shall receive within five business days of such surrender in exchange therefor (A) a New Certificate representing that number of whole Park Common Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and/or (B) a check in an amount equal to the sum of the cash to be paid to such holder as part of the Merger Consideration, the cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Park Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.04 and/or the cash to be paid in respect of any dividends or distributions with respect to Park Common Shares to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings, and the Old Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Vision Bancshares, a New Certificate representing the proper number of Park Common Shares may be issued, and/or the cash to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration, in lieu of any fractional Park Common Shares and/or in respect of any dividends or distributions with respect to Park Common Shares may be paid pursuant to Section 3.06, to a transferee if the Old Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.05(c), each Old Certificate will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender a New Certificate and/or a check in an amount equal to the sum of the cash to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration, the cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Park Common Shares and/or the cash to be paid in respect of any dividends or distributions with respect to Park Common Shares to which the holder may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof. 

  

 (d) _ _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Vision Bancshares Old Certificates__. If any Old Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Park, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Park may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate (i) the number of Park Common Shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a) with respect to the shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock formerly represented thereby, and/or (ii) a check in an amount equal to the sum of the cash to be paid to such Person as part of the Merger Consideration, the cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Park Common Shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 3.04 and/or the cash to be paid in respect of any dividends or distributions with respect to Park Common Shares to which such Person may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06. 

  

 (e) _ _Termination of Exchange Fund__. Any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to the Exchange Agent by Park pursuant to Section 3.05(a) that remains undistributed to the shareholders of Vision Bancshares for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any shareholders of Vision Bancshares who have not complied with this 

   ##### 

  

    

Article III by such time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of a
fractional Park Common Share interest, and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Park Common Shares payable in accordance with Section 3.06,
in each case without interest. 

  

 (f) _ _No Liability__. None of Park, Vision Bancshares, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of Vision Bancshares Common Stock for any payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of a fractional Park Common Share interest, or any dividends or distributions with respect to Park Common Shares payable in accordance with Section 3.06, delivered to a public official if required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (g) _ _Withholding Rights__.

To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Park or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Vision Bancshares Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

  

 (h) _ _Waiver__. The Surviving Corporation may from time to time, in the case of one or more Persons, waive one or more of the rights provided to it in this Article III to withhold certain payments, deliveries and distributions; and no such waiver shall constitute a waiver of its rights thereafter to withhold any such payment, delivery or distribution in the case of any Person. 

  

 3.06 _Park Dividends and Distributions_. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Park on the Park Common Shares, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all Park Common Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Park Common Shares as of any time subsequent to the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any Old Certificate until such holder surrenders such Old Certificate for exchange as provided in this Article III. Upon surrender of such Old Certificate, both the Merger Consideration (without interest) and any declared and unpaid dividends payable under this Section 3.06 (without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to the shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate. 

  

 3.07 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event Park changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of Park Common Shares issued and outstanding between the date hereof and the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, split up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Park Common Shares and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Stock Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted.

   ##### 

  

    

Stock subject to the portion of such Vision Bancshares Stock Option which has
not been exercised on or before the Election Deadline, minus (ii) the
aggregate exercise price for the shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock
subject to the portion of such Vision Bancshares Stock Option which has not
been exercised on or before the Election Deadline. Prior to the
Election Deadline, Vision Bancshares shall take all actions necessary to
cause any provision under plans, programs or arrangements providing for the
issuance or grant of any interest in respect of the capital stock of Vision
Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate as of the
Election Deadline, and Vision Bancshares shall ensure that following the
Election Deadline, no Employee, Consultant or Director shall have any Rights,
other than the right to receive the cash payment described in the first
sentence of this Section 3.08(a), in respect of shares of Vision
Bancshares Common Stock or any other equity interest in Vision Bancshares
under the Vision Bancshares Stock Plans or any other plans, programs or
arrangements providing for the issuance or grant of any other Right in
respect of the capital stock of Vision Bancshares or any Subsidiary. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Election Deadline, Vision Bancshares shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the Vision Bancshares ESPP to terminate the Vision Bancshares ESPP (and all outstanding Vision Bancshares Stock Subscriptions and other Rights thereunder) effective as of the Election Deadline. Any Employee who is a participant in the Vision Bancshares ESPP and who has not paid the entire balance due for any shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock for which such Employee has subscribed pursuant to the terms of the Vision Bancshares ESPP may pay such balance in full on or prior to the Election Deadline and receive the applicable shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock. The failure of a participating Employee to pay such balance in full on or prior to the Election Deadline will be treated as a cancellation of the Employees Vision Bancshares Stock Subscription(s) and Vision Bancshares will refund (without interest) all amounts the Employee has had withheld or has paid with respect to the canceled Vision Bancshares Stock Subscription(s). 

  

 (c) Prior to the Election Deadline, the Vision Bancshares Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Vision Bancshares Stock Plans and/or the Vision Bancshares ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions and take such actions as are necessary to carry out the terms of this Section 3.08 (without the creation of any additional liability for Vision Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries).

Anything contained in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary notwithstanding, if any holder of an outstanding share of Vision Bancshares Common Stock as of the Effective Time seeks relief as a dissenting shareholder under Article 13 of the Alabama Code (a " _ _Vision Bancshares Dissenting Share__ "), then such Vision Bancshares Dissenting Share shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and instead: 

  

 (a) Each such Vision Bancshares Dissenting Share shall nevertheless be deemed to be extinguished at the Effective Time as provided elsewhere in this Agreement; and 

  

 (b) Each holder perfecting such dissenters rights shall thereafter have only such rights (and shall have such obligations) as are provided in Article 13 of the Alabama Code, and the Surviving Corporation shall be required to deliver only such cash payments to which the Vision Bancshares Dissenting Shares are entitled pursuant to Article 13 of the Alabama Code; _provided, however_ , that if any such Person shall forfeit such right to payment of the fair value under Article 13 of the Alabama Code, each such holders Vision Bancshares Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as shall have been designated by each such holder, subject to Section 3.01. 

  

 Any Election Form/Letter of Transmittal or Letter of Transmittal submitted by a holder of Vision Bancshares Dissenting Shares shall be invalid, unless and until the demand for payment of the fair value 

   ##### 

  

    

of the shares of Vision Bancshares Common Stock shall have been or is deemed
to have been withdrawn or forfeited. 

  

 Any payments made in respect of Vision Bancshares Dissenting Shares shall be made by Park.

The documents described in clauses (A) and (B) above (collectively, the " _ _Vision Bancshares Financial Statements__ "): 

  

       | (1)  |   | are true, complete and correct;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | are in accordance with the books and records of Vision
Bancshares;  
      
    | (3)  |   | comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto;  
      
    | (4)  |   | fairly and accurately present the consolidated
financial condition of Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof, and their respective consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended, as applicable (except in each case as may
be noted therein and subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, to the absence of full footnotes and to normal year-end audit
adjustments that are not material in amount or in effect);  
      
    | (5)  |   | were prepared on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved; and  
      
    | (6)  |   | have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except in
each case as may be noted therein and subject, in the case of unaudited
interim financial statements, to the absence of full footnotes and to normal
year-end audit adjustments that are not material in amount or in effect).  
   

   

 (ii) Except as disclosed in Section 5.02(g)(ii) of the Vision Bancshares Disclosure Schedule and except as arising under this Agreement, neither Vision Bancshares nor any of its Subsidiaries has any debt, liability, guarantee or obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), other than debts, liabilities, guarantees and obligations which, individually or in the aggregate, do not exceed $10,000, except for those liabilities that 

   ##### 

  

    

are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Vision
Bancshares included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly
period ended June 30, 2006 (including any footnotes thereto). Except as
disclosed in Section 5.02(g)(ii) of the Vision Bancshares Disclosure
Schedule, all debts, liabilities and guarantees and obligations of
Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries since June 30, 2006 have been incurred
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and are
usual and normal in amount both individually and in the aggregate. 

   

 (iii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Vision Bancshares or one of its Subsidiaries or their respective accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below in this Section 5.02(g)(iii). Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (A) transactions are executed only in accordance with managements authorization; (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries in conformity with GAAP consistently applied with respect to any criteria applicable to such financial statements and to maintain accountability for the property and assets of Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries; (C) access to such property and assets is permitted only in accordance with managements authorization; (D) the reporting of such property and assets is compared with existing property and assets at regular intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences; and (E) accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. Vision Bancshares (1) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries is made known to management of Vision Bancshares by others within Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act with respect to the Vision Bancshares SEC Documents, and (2) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Vision Bancshares outside auditors and the audit committee of the Vision Bancshares Board (y) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Vision Bancshares ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (z) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Vision Bancshares internal control over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Vision Bancshares auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to Park. As of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that Vision Bancshares outside auditors and its principal executive officer and principal financial offer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Sections 302, 404 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,

The documents described in clauses (A) and (B) above (collectively, the " _ _Park Financial Statements__ "): 

  

       | (1)  |   | are true, complete and correct;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | are in accordance with the books and records of
Park;  
      
    | (3)  |   | comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto;  
      
    | (4)  |   | fairly and accurately present the consolidated
financial condition of Park and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof, and
their respective consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended, as applicable (except in each case as may be noted
therein and subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, to the absence of full footnotes and to normal year-end
audit adjustments that are not material in amount or in effect);  
      
    | (5)  |   | were prepared on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved; and  
      
    | (6)  |   | have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except in
each case as may be noted therein and subject, in the case of unaudited
interim financial statements, to the absence of full footnotes and to normal
year-end audit adjustments that are not material in amount or in effect).  
   

   

 (ii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Park and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Park or one of its Subsidiaries or their respective accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below in this Section 5.03(f)(ii). Park and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 

   ##### 

  

    

statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (A)
transactions are executed only in accordance with managements authorization;
(B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the
financial statements of Park and its Subsidiaries in conformity with GAAP
consistently applied with respect to any criteria applicable to
such financial statements and to maintain accountability for the property and
assets of Park and its Subsidiaries; (C) access to such property and assets
is permitted only in accordance with managements authorization; (D) the
reporting of such property and assets is compared with existing property and
assets at regular intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences; and (E) accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory
are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented
to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. Park (1) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Park and its Subsidiaries is made known to
the management of Park by others within Park and its Subsidiaries as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act with respect to the Park
SEC Documents, and (2) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to Parks outside auditors and the audit committee
of the Park Board (y) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parks ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (z) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parks internal control over financial reporting. As of
the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that Parks outside auditors
and its principal executive officer and principal financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Sections 302, 404 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification (except to the extent expressly
permitted by such rules and regulations), when next due. 

   

 (iv) Since December 31, 2005, (A) neither Park nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to Parks knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Park or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Park or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Park or one of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no attorney representing Park or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Park or one of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Park or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Park Board or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Park.

 (k) _ _Tax Matters__. Park and its Subsidiaries have timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority. Such Tax Returns are and will be true, correct and complete in all material respects. Park and its Subsidiaries have paid and discharged all Taxes due (whether reflected on such Tax Returns or otherwise), other than such Taxes that are adequately reserved as shown on the Park Financial Statements or have arisen in the ordinary course of business since June 30, 2006 or Taxes the nonpayment of which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Park. Neither the IRS nor any other Governmental Authority, domestic or foreign, has asserted, is now asserting or, to the knowledge of Park, is threatening to assert against Park or any of its Subsidiaries any material deficiency or claim for additional Taxes. No federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are pending or being conducted with respect to Park or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Park, no such audit or proceeding is threatened.

There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of Park or any of its Subsidiaries, other than Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable.

any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise. As of the date hereof, neither Park nor

that might prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 (i) as disclosed in the Park Financial Statements; or 

   

 (ii) as would not be required to be publicly disclosed by Park pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 (p) _ _Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC and Customer Information__. Park is not aware of, has not been advised in writing of, and has no reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause Park or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed (i) to be operating in violation in any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering Law; or (ii) not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy and customer information requirements contained in any federal and state privacy Laws, including, without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the information security program adopted by Park pursuant to 12 C.F.R Part 40\. Park is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause Park to believe that any non-public customer information has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that would cause Park or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any material remedial action. The Park Board (or, where appropriate, the board of directors of one of Parks Subsidiaries) has adopted and implemented an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the Patriot Act and such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements in all material respects of Section 352 of the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder, and Park (or the appropriate Subsidiary) has

becomes readily ascertainable from published information or trade sources, or
(v) is such that such party is required by Law or court order to disclose. If
any party is required or reasonably believes that it is required to disclose
any Information described in this Section 6.05(b) by (A) applicable Law, (B)
any court of competent jurisdiction or (C) any inquiry or investigation by
any Governmental Authority or Regulatory Authority that is lawfully entitled
to require any such disclosure, such party (the " _ _Required Party__ ")
shall, so far so it is lawful, notify the other party of such required
disclosure on the same day that the Required Party (1) is notified of a
request for such disclosure from the relevant Governmental Authority
or Regulatory Authority or (2) determines that such disclosure is required,
whichever is earlier. Immediately thereafter, and to the extent practical on
the same day, and subject to applicable Laws, the parties shall discuss and
use their reasonable best efforts to agree as to the mandatory nature, the
required timing and the required content of such disclosure. The Required
Party shall furnish only that portion of the Information described in this
Section 6.05 that is legally required to be disclosed and shall exercise its
reasonable best efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to the Information described in this
Section 6.05 so furnished. The Information shall not be used in any way
detrimental to a party including use directly or indirectly in the conduct of
the other partys business or an enterprise in which such other party may
have an interest, now or in the future, and whether or not in competition
with such other party. In the event that this Agreement is terminated or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be
consummated, each party shall promptly cause all Information relating to the
other party, and furnished by the other party or prepared pursuant to
Information provided by the other party regardless of who prepared
the Information, to be returned to the party that furnished the same or to be
destroyed. It is agreed and understood that the obligations of Vision
Bancshares and Park contained in this Section 6.05 shall survive the Closing.
No investigation by either party of the business and affairs of the other
shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to any partys
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (c) _ _Subsequent Financial Information__ _._ During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each party shall promptly furnish to the other party copies of all monthly and other interim financial statements produced in the ordinary course of business as the same shall become available. 

  

 6.06 _Acquisition Proposals._ Vision Bancshares agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors and 

   ##### 

  

    

affiliates not to, solicit, initiate or encourage inquiries or proposals with
respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential information to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however,_ that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Vision Bancshares Board from
(a) making any disclosure to the Vision Bancshares shareholders if, in the
good faith judgment of the Vision Bancshares Board, after having consulted
with and considered the advice of outside legal counsel to the Vision
Bancshares Board, failure so to disclose would be a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law;  _provided further, however_ , that any such
disclosure regarding an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change
in Recommendation unless the Vision Bancshares Board reaffirms the
Vision Bancshares Recommendation; (b) before the date of the Vision
Bancshares Meeting, providing (or authorizing the provision of) information
to, or engaging in (or authorizing) such discussions or negotiations with,
any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal received after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.06; or (c) recommending such an Acquisition Proposal
to the Vision Bancshares shareholders if and only to the extent that, in the
case of actions referred to in clause (b) and/or clause (c), (i)
such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Vision Bancshares Board after having consulted with and
considered the advice of outside legal counsel to the Vision Bancshares Board
determines in good faith that providing such information or engaging in such
negotiations or discussions, or making such recommendation is required in
order to discharge the directors fiduciary duties to Vision Bancshares and
its shareholders in accordance with applicable Law, and (iii) Vision
Bancshares receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, a " _ _Superior Proposal__ " means any Acquisition
Proposal by a third party on terms that the Vision Bancshares Board
determines in its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of its
financial advisors, to be materially more favorable from a financial point of
view to Vision Bancshares and its shareholders than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, after taking into account the likelihood of
consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein, taking into
account all legal, financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other
relevant factors permitted under applicable Laws. Vision Bancshares also
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of this Agreement
with any parties other than Park with respect to any of the foregoing. Vision
Bancshares shall promptly (within one business day) advise Park following the
receipt by Vision Bancshares of any Acquisition Proposal and the material
terms thereof (including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal), and advise Park of any developments (including any change in such
terms) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal promptly upon the occurrence
thereof, including the response of the Vision Bancshares Board thereto.
Vision Bancshares shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision
of or release any of its rights under any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it is a party. Vision Bancshares shall enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws, the provisions of any such
agreement, including, but not limited to, by obtaining an injunction to
prevent any breaches of such agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in any court having jurisdiction. Nothing contained in
this Section 6.06 or any other provision of this Agreement will prohibit
Vision Bancshares or the Vision Bancshares Board from notifying any third
party that contacts Vision Bancshares on an unsolicited basis after the date
of this Agreement concerning an Acquisition Proposal of Vision Bancshares
obligations under this Section 6.06. 

  

 6.07 _Affiliate Agreements._ Not later than the 15th day prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Vision Bancshares shall deliver to Park a schedule of each Person that, to the best of Vision Bancshares knowledge, is or is reasonably likely to be, as of the date of the Vision Bancshares Meeting, deemed to be an "affiliate" of Vision Bancshares (each, a " _ _Vision Bancshares Affiliate__ ") as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act. Vision Bancshares shall cause each Person who may be deemed to be a Vision Bancshares Affiliate to execute and deliver to Vision Bancshares on or before the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus an agreement in the form attached hereto as 

   ##### 

  

    

 _ _Exhibit B__. Vision Bancshares shall deliver such executed agreements of
the Vision Bancshares Affiliates to Park at the Closing. 

  

 6.08 _Takeover Laws._ No party hereto shall take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or, if necessary, challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. Neither party will take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby not to comply with any Takeover Provisions and each of them will take all necessary steps within its control to make those transactions comply with (or continue to comply with) the Takeover Provisions. 

  

 6.09 _No Rights Triggered._ Vision Bancshares shall take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any other action or combination of actions, or any other transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any Person (a) under the Governing Documents of Vision Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) under any Material Contract to which Vision Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries is a party except as contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.10 _Conformance of Policies and Practices._ Prior to the Effective Time, Vision Bancshares shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consistent with GAAP and on a basis and on timing mutually satisfactory to it and Park, modify and change their respective loan, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) as well as other management and operating policies and practices so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with those of Park and its Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , that Vision Bancshares shall not be obligated to take any such action pursuant to this Section 6.10 involving a valuation adjustment or earnings charge earlier than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, and unless and until Park acknowledges that all conditions to the obligation of Park to consummate the Merger have been satisfied and certifies to Vision Bancshares that Parks representations and warranties are true and correct in all material respects as of such date and that Park is otherwise materially in compliance with this Agreement. Vision Bancshares representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect for any purpose as a consequence of any modifications or changes undertaken solely on account of this Section 6.10. 

  

 6.11 _Transition._ Vision Bancshares shall reasonably cooperate with Park in order to facilitate an orderly transition of the management of the business of Vision Bancshares to Park and in order to facilitate the integration of the operations of Vision Bancshares and Park and to permit the coordination of their related operations on a timely basis. To accelerate to the earliest time possible following the Effective Time the realization of synergies, operating efficiencies and other benefits expected to be realized by Vision Bancshares and Park as a result of the Merger, Vision Bancshares shall consult with Park on all strategic and operational matters to the extent such consultation is not in violation of applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition. Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 6.05(b), Park and its officers, employees, legal counsel, financial advisors and other representatives shall, upon reasonable written notice to Vision Bancshares, be entitled to review the operations and visit the facilities of Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries at all times as may be deemed reasonably necessary by Park in order to accomplish the foregoing arrangements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement gives Park, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct or to unreasonably interfere with Vision Bancshares or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their respective operations. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.12 _Reports._ Each of Vision Bancshares and Park shall file (and shall cause Vision Bancshares Subsidiaries and Parks Subsidiaries, respectively, to file), between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, all reports required to be filed by it (or them) with the SEC and any other Regulatory Authorities having jurisdiction over such party, and Vision Bancshares shall deliver to Park copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed. If financial statements are contained in any such reports filed with the SEC, such financial statements will fairly present the consolidated financial position of the entity filing such financial statements as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of operations, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the periods then ended in accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial statements to the absence of full footnotes and to normal recurring year-end audit adjustments that are not material in amount or in effect). As of their respective dates, such reports filed with the SEC will comply in all material respects with the federal securities Laws and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not misleading. Any financial statements contained in any reports to a Regulatory Authority shall be prepared in accordance with requirements applicable to such reports. 

  

 6.13 _Exchange Listing._ Park will use all reasonable best efforts to cause the Park Common Shares to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on AMEX, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event before the Effective Time. 

  

 6.14 _Regulatory Applications._  

  

 (a) _ _Preparation and Filing__ _._ Park and Vision Bancshares and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation and requests for regulatory approvals, to timely effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities and Regulatory Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Park and Vision Bancshares shall provide all information required from it and its Subsidiaries in order to enable the other to make necessary filings. Such information shall be delivered within five business days of a written request for such information. Each of Park and Vision Bancshares shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, and shall be provided in advance so as to reasonably exercise its right to review in advance, all material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority or Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities and Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (b) _ _Information to be Furnished__ _._ Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party or Governmental Authority or Regulatory Authority. 

  

 6.15 _Indemnification._  

  

 (a) _ _Indemnity by Park__ _._ Following the Effective Date, Park shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless all Directors, Officers and Employees of Vision Bancshares and its Subsidiaries (each, an 

   ##### 

  

    

" _ _Indemnified Party__ ") against all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of actions or omissions or alleged actions or omissions in the
course of the Indemnified Partys duties as a director, officer or employee
of Vision Bancshares or one of its Subsidiaries occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) to the fullest extent that Vision Bancshares is permitted
to indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors, officers and employees
under the laws of the States of Alabama and, as appropriate, Florida, and
consistent with the terms and conditions of the Vision Bancshares Articles
and the Vision Bancshares Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Park shall not be obligated to indemnify a
director, officer or employee for acts or omissions of such director, officer
or employee that were beyond the scope of the duties of such director,
officer or employee as a director, officer or employee of Vision Bancshares
or one of its Subsidiaries. Any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards
set forth under the Vision Bancshares Articles, the Vision Bancshares Bylaws
and applicable Law for indemnification shall be made by the court in which
the claim, action, suit or proceeding was brought or by independent legal
counsel (which shall not be legal counsel that provides services to Park)
selected by Park and reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party or
selected by the Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to Park. As a
condition to receiving such indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall
assign to Park, by separate writing, all right, title and interest in and to
the proceeds of the Indemnified Partys applicable insurance coverage, if
any, including insurance maintained or provided by Park or Vision Bancshares
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to the extent of such indemnity. No
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to such indemnification with respect to a
claim (i) if such Indemnified Party fails to cooperate in the defense
and investigation of such claim as to which indemnification may be made, (ii)
made by such Indemnified Party against Park, any Subsidiary of Park, Vision
Bancshares or any Subsidiary of Vision Bancshares arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the
conduct of the business of Park, the Subsidiary of Park, Vision Bancshares or
the Subsidiary of Vision Bancshares, or (iii) if such Person fails to deliver
such notices as may be required under any applicable directors and officers
liability insurance policy to preserve any possible claims of which the
Indemnified Party is aware, to the extent such failure results in the denial
of payment under such policy. 

  

 (b) _ _D andO Insurance__ _._ For a period of three years from the Effective Time, Park shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide that portion of directors and officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former Officers and Directors of Vision Bancshares or its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such Directors and Officers arising from facts or events that occurred before the Effective Time, on terms no less favorable than those in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that Park may substitute therefor policies providing at least comparable coverage containing terms and conditions no less favorable than those in effect on the date of this Agreement; and _provided, further_ , that Officers and Directors of Vision Bancshares or its Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide customary representations and warranties to Parks insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance; and  _provided, further_ , in no event shall the annual premium on such policy exceed 125% of the annual premium payments on Vision Bancshares policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _ _Maximum Amount__ "). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Park shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. 

  

 (c) _ _Procedures; Limitations__ _._ Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.15(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, shall promptly notify Park thereof; provided that the failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of 

   ##### 

  

    

Park under Section 6.15(a) unless and to the extent that Park is actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. In the event of a claim (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Park shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof and Park shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other legal counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Park elects not to assume such defense or
legal counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues that
raise conflicts of interest between Park and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain legal counsel satisfactory to them, and Park
shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such legal counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided,
however_ , that Park shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay
for only one firm of legal counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one legal counsel for such Indemnified Parties
would present such legal counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and
(iii) Park shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and
_provided, further_ , that Park shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-
appealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. 

  

 (d) _ _Legal Successors__ _._ If Park or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Park shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.15. 

  

 (e) _ _Beneficiaries__. The provisions of this Section 6.15 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  

 6.16 _Employment Agreements; Opportunity of Employment; Employee Benefits._  

  

 (a) _ _Employment Agreements__. As of the date of this Agreement, Park and Vision Alabama and/or Vision Florida shall enter into an employment agreement with each of (i) J. Daniel Sizemore, (ii) William E. Blackmon, (iii) Andrew W. Braswell, (iv) Joey W. Ginn, (v) Robert S. McKean, (vi) Diane Anderson, (vii) Tommy Files, (viii) Robin Fly, (ix) James E. Kirkland, (x) William Lloyd, (xi) Debbie McBride-Schmidt and (xii) Darrell W. Melton (the " _ _Employment Agreements__ "), forms of each of which are attached hereto as __Exhibits C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11__ and __C-12__ , respectively, and each of which shall become effective at the Effective Time if the Closing occurs as provided in Section 2.03 of this Agreement. Each Employment Agreement will replace and supersede the current employment agreement, change in control and non-competition agreement or change in control agreement with Vision Bancshares and/or one of the Subsidiaries of Vision Bancshares to which the relevant individual is a party, if any. 

  

 (b) _ _Opportunity of Employment__. Each existing Employee of Vision Bancshares or a Subsidiary of Vision Bancshares who has not entered into an Employment Agreement as contemplated by Section 6.16(a) and who is actively employed at the Effective Time shall have the opportunity to continue as an at-will employee of Park or one of Parks Subsidiaries. It is understood and agreed that except as provided in Section 6.16(a), nothing in this Section 6.16 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract of employment or be construed to give any Employee of Vision Bancshares and/or its Subsidiaries any rights other than as employees at will under applicable Law and said Employees shall not be deemed to be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.16(b). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _ _Employee Benefits__. Employees of Vision Bancshares and/or its Subsidiaries who continue as employees of Park or one of Parks Subsidiaries from and after the Effective Time (" _ _Continuing Employees__ ") shall continue to participate in the Compensation and Benefit Plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless and until Park, in its sole discretion, shall determine that the Continuing Employees shall, subject to applicable eligibility requirements, participate in employee benefit plans of Park or a Subsidiary of Park, and that some or all of the Compensation and Benefit Plans shall be frozen, terminated or merged into certain employee benefit plans of Park or one of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with years of service with Vision Bancshares, the appropriate Vision Bancshares Subsidiary and, to the extent credit would have been given by Vision Bancshares or the appropriate Vision Bancshares Subsidiary for years of service with a predecessor (including any business organization acquired by Vision Bancshares or any Vision Bancshares Subsidiary), of Vision Bancshares or any Vision Bancshares Subsidiary, for purposes of entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement, eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan) in the employee benefit plans of Park. Service with Vision Bancshares and the appropriate Vision Bancshares Subsidiary shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition limitations with respect to any Park employee benefit plan that is a group health plan. Each Park employee benefit plan that is a group health plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable Vision Bancshares Compensation and Benefit Plan that is a group health plan. Continuing Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding group health plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Park group health plan. Park shall, before the Effective Time, adopt resolutions that amend its employee benefit plans to provide for the Vision Bancshares or Vision Bancshares Subsidiary service credits referenced herein.

 6.17 _Notification of Certain Matters._  

  

 (a) _ _Material Adverse Effect; Material Breach__ _._ Between the date hereof and the Closing, each of Vision Bancshares and Park shall give prompt notice in writing to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach (without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifier included in any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement) of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. 

  

 (b) _ _Persons Required to Consent to Merger__. Vision Bancshares shall promptly notify Park of any written notice or other bona fide communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required as a condition to the Merger. 

  

 (c) _ _Notice to Insurers__. Vision Bancshares shall, prior to the Effective Time, notify its insurers in writing of all known incidents, events and circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim against Vision Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries.

 6.19 _Tax Treatment._ Each of Park and Vision Bancshares agrees not to take any actions subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would adversely affect the ability of Vision Bancshares and its shareholders to characterize the Merger as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, and each of Park and Vision Bancshares agrees to take such action as may be reasonably required, if such action may be reasonably taken to reverse the impact of any past actions that would adversely impact the ability for the Merger to be characterized as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 6.20 _No Breaches of Representations and Warranties._ Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, without the written consent of the other party, each of Park and Vision Bancshares will not do any act or suffer any omission of any nature whatsoever that would cause any of the representations or warranties made in Article V of this Agreement to become untrue or incorrect. 

  

 6.21 _Consents_. Each of Park and Vision Bancshares shall use its best efforts to obtain any required consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 6.24 _Delivery of Real Property Documents._  

  

 (a) Within five business days after the date of this Agreement, Vision Bancshares, its Subsidiaries and/or Related Persons shall deliver to Park copies of any and all of the following relative to any real property listed in the Vision Bancshares Disclosure Schedule: title commitments, title policies, environmental assessments, physical inspection reports, and any and all other studies, tests, examinations, reports, surveys and other documentation with respect to the physical and environmental condition of the real property at issue including but not limited to any orders, correspondence, consents, permits or approvals from any Governmental Authorities or Regulatory Authorities. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Upon request of Park at any time prior to the Closing Date, Vision Bancshares shall immediately request, and deliver to Park as soon as reasonably possible thereafter, an estoppel certificate from each landlord when Vision Bancshares or one of its Subsidiaries is the tenant, or each tenant when Vision Bancshares or one of its Subsidiaries is the landlord, under each and every lease of real property listed in the Vision Bancshares Disclosure Schedule.

 (c) _ _Delay__ _._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Park or Vision Bancshares, duly authorized by action taken by or on behalf of its board of directors, by providing written notice to the other party, in the event that the Merger is not consummated by May 15, 2007, except to the extent that 

   ##### 

  

    

the failure of the Merger then to be consummated arises out of or results
from the knowing action or inaction of the party seeking to terminate
pursuant to this Section 8.01(c).

 (e) _ _Superior Proposal__ _._ At any time prior to the approval of this Agreement by the holders of Vision Bancshares Common Stock contemplated by Section 7.01(a) by Vision Bancshares, if the Vision Bancshares Board so determines by vote of a majority of the members of the entire Vision Bancshares Board if (i) Vision Bancshares is not in breach of any material term of this Agreement including Section 6.06, (ii) the Vision Bancshares Board authorized Vision Bancshares, subject to complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a definitive written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (iii) Vision Bancshares notifies Park in writing that Vision Bancshares intends to enter into such an agreement as soon as practicable upon termination of this Agreement, attaching the most current version of such agreement to such notice and (iv) at least five business days elapse after Park receives the written notice provided for in clause (iii) above and the Vision Bancshares Board continues to consider the Acquisition Proposal to be a Superior Proposal after taking into account in good faith any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Park during such five business day period. 

  

 (f) _ _Change in Recommendation__ _._ By Park, duly authorized by action taken by or on behalf of the Park Board, by providing written notice to Vision Bancshares, if (i) in connection with the presentation of this Agreement to the holders of Vision Bancshares Common Stock as contemplated by Section 6.02, the Vision Bancshares Board shall have failed to make the Vision Bancshares Recommendation; or withdrawn, modified or qualified (or proposed to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Park, the Vision Bancshares Recommendation; or taken any other action or made any other statement in connection with the Vision Bancshares Meeting inconsistent with the Vision Bancshares Recommendation (any such action in this clause (i), a " _ _Change in Recommendation__ "), whether or not permitted by the terms of this Agreement, (ii) Vision Bancshares materially breached its obligations under this Agreement by reason of a failure to call the Vision Bancshares Meeting in accordance with Section 6.02 or the failure to prepare and mail to its shareholders the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in accordance with Section 6.03 or (iii) the Vision Bancshares Board takes the actions described in Section 6.06. 

  

 (g) _ _Park Common Shares__. 

   

 (i) By Vision Bancshares, duly authorized by action taken by or on behalf of the Vision Bancshares Board, by providing written notice to Park at any time during the three-day period commencing with the Determination Date (as defined below), if the 

   ##### 

  

    

following condition is satisfied: the average of the closing sale price of
a Park Common Share on AMEX (as reported on www.amex.com or, if not reported
thereon, as reported in another authoritative source) during the period of
the 20 Trading Days ending on the tenth Trading Day prior to the date then
established for the Closing Date (such average referred to herein as the " _
_Park Reference Price__ ," and such period referred to herein as the " _
_Reference Period__ "), is less than $81.00, appropriately adjusted for any
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, split up,
combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding Park Common Shares during the period between the
last Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the first public
announcement of entry into this Agreement (the " _ _Starting Date__ ") and

 8.02 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment; Enforcement of Agreement._ In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to the other party hereunder except: 

  

 (a) as set forth in Sections 8.03, 9.01 and 9.05; and 

  

 (b) that termination will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement giving rise to such termination. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage will occur in the event that a party breaches any of its obligations, duties, covenants and agreements contained herein. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled by Law or in equity. 

  

 8.03 _Termination Fee; Expenses._  

  

 (a) _ _Obligation to Pay Termination Fee__ _._ Vision Bancshares shall promptly pay to Park a termination fee in the amount of $6,500,000 (the " _ _Termination Fee__ ") in immediately available federal funds if: 

   

 (i) this Agreement is terminated by Vision Bancshares pursuant to Section 8.01(e); or 

   

 (ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Park pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii) as a result of a willful breach by Vision Bancshares or 8.01(f), or by Park or Vision Bancshares pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii); and (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to any such termination, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Vision Bancshares shall have been publicly announced, publicly proposed or commenced; and (C) within 12 months after the date of such termination, Vision Bancshares shall have entered into an agreement relating to such previously announced 

   ##### 

  

    

Acquisition Proposal or such previously announced Acquisition Proposal shall
have been consummated. No termination fee shall be paid unless all of
the conditions set forth in subclauses (A), (B) and (C), above, have occurred
_._  

  

 (b) The Termination Fee shall be payable (i) on the date of termination of this Agreement in the case of clause (a)(i) above; and (ii) two business days after the first to occur of the execution of the agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal in the case of clause (a)(ii) above. Upon payment of the Termination Fee and Out-of-Pocket Expenses in accordance with this Section 8.03, Vision Bancshares shall have no further liability to Park at Law or in equity with respect to such termination under Section 8.01(e), 8.01(b) or 8.01(f), or with respect to this Agreement. Vision Bancshares acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Park would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Vision Bancshares fails to pay timely any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.03 and, in order to obtain such payment, Park commences a suit that results in a judgment against Vision Bancshares for the amount payable to Park pursuant to this Section 8.03, Vision Bancshares shall pay to Park its reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount so payable at the applicable federal funds rate. 

  

 (c) If an Acquisition Proposal has been made known to Vision Bancshares and made known to the holders of Vision Bancshares Common Stock generally or has been made directly to the holders of Vision Bancshares Common Stock generally or any Person has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a bona fide Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal or announced intention has not been withdrawn, and thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(c) by Park as a result of knowing action or inaction of Vision Bancshares, and within six months following the termination pursuant to Section 8.01(c), Vision Bancshares enters in an agreement with the Person making any of the above-mentioned Acquisition Proposals, then Vision Bancshares shall promptly (but not later than two business days after signing an agreement with the person making the Acquisition Proposal) pay to Park an amount (not to exceed $250,000 in the aggregate) equal to all documented out-of-pocket expenses and fees incurred by Park (including, without limitation, fees and expenses payable to all legal, accounting, financial, public relations and other professional advisors arising out of or in connection with or related to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (" _ _Out-of-Pocket Expenses__ "), and Park may pursue any remedies available to it at Law or in equity and will, in addition to its Out-of-Pocket Expenses (which are to be paid as specified above), be entitled to receive such additional amounts as such non-breaching party may be entitled to receive at Law or in equity, but in no event shall such additional amounts plus the Out-of-Pocket Expenses exceed $6,500,000 in total. 

  

ARTICLE IX  Miscellaneous 

   

 9.01 _Survival._ No representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (other than covenants which by their terms are to survive the Closing or are to be performed after the Effective Time) or the termination of this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time (other than Sections 5.02(l), 5.03(r), 6.03(b), 6.04, 6.05(b), 8.02 and 8.03 and this Article IX which shall survive such termination). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such representations, warranties, agreements or covenants shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive the Surviving Corporation (or any director, officer or controlling person thereof) of any defense in Law or equity which otherwise would be available against the claims of any Person, including, without limitation, any shareholder or former shareholder of Park or Vision Bancshares. 

   #####

 (a) waived by the party benefited by the provision, or 

  

 (b) amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing between the parties hereto executed in the same manner as this Agreement, except to the extent that any such amendment would violate applicable Law or require resubmission of this Agreement or the plan of merger contained herein to the shareholders of Vision Bancshares. 

  

 The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 

  

 9.03 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall be effective when both counterparts have been signed by each of the parties, and delivered to the other party; it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 9.04 _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Ohio applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal Law are applicable).

 (a) the costs (excluding the fees and disbursements of legal counsel, financial advisors and accountants) incurred in connection with the preparation (including copying and printing and distributing) of the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and applications to Governmental Authorities for the approval of the Merger, and 

  

 (b) all filing or registration fees, including, without limitation, fees paid for filing the Registration Statement with the SEC. 

  

 9.06 _Notices._ All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted to be given hereunder to a party shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given: 

  

 (a) on the date of delivery, if personally delivered or sent by facsimile (with confirmation of receipt), 

  

 (b) on the first business day following the date of dispatch, if delivered by a recognized next-day courier service or 

  

 (c) on the third business day following the date of mailing, if mailed by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid (return receipt requested), 

 

in each case to such party at its address set forth below or such other
address as such party may specify by notice to the parties hereto.

If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
