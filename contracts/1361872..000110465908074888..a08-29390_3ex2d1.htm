reasonable efforts to resolve the Disputed Merger Items during the 45-day
period commencing on the date Parent receives such Merger Consideration

Agreement and in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis
therefor. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon EDandF, Parent and the other parties hereto absent manifest error,
and judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in
any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination
is to be enforced.

  



  

(iii) The Accounting Firm shall be required to make a determination with
respect only to the Unresolved Merger Items, and in a manner consistent with
this _Section 2.9_ and the Applicable Accounting Principles, and in no event
shall the Accounting Firms determination of Unresolved Merger Items be for
an amount outside the range of the parties disagreement. Each party shall

papers and other documents and information pertaining to the
Unresolved Merger Items as the Accounting Firm may request.

(v) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne in the same

are unsuccessfully disputed by each party (as finally determined by the
Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all of the
Unresolved Merger Items submitted to the Accounting Firm.

  



        
   

  



  

(vi) Until the Final Merger Adjustment Amount is determined, each of Parent
and EDandF shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with, make

Days after the date on which the Final Merger Adjustment Amount is finally
determined pursuant to _Section_ 2.9(c):

  



  

(i) if the Final Merger Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Merger
Adjustment Amount, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to EDandF or its
designee the amount of such excess by Wire Transfer; or

  



  

(ii) if the Estimated Merger Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Merger
Adjustment Amount, EDandF shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its
designee the amount of such excess by Wire Transfer.

  



  

(e) _Interest, etc_. Any amount payable pursuant to subclause (i) or
subclause (ii) of _Section 2.9(d)_ shall be increased by interest on such
amount, compounded daily, at the Interest Rate from the Closing Date to and
including the date of payment based on a 365 day year, with the amount of any
interest also payable on the same date as the underlying amount pursuant to
such subclause (i) or subclause (ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no

2.9_ until the Final Stock Sale Adjustment Amount is finally determined

shall prepare the Capex Statement in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles. For purposes of any calculation of
Capital Expenditures (including with respect to Budgeted Capital Expenditures
and Actual Capital Expenditures) during the Capex Period pursuant to this
_Section 2.10_, the amount of Capital Expenditures attributable to the
calendar month in which the Closing Date occurs shall be prorated in the
basis of the number of days elapsed in such month as of and including the
Closing Date.

  



  

(b) If EDandF does not give written notice of dispute (a " _Capex Dispute
Notice_ ") to Parent within 30 days after receiving the Capex Statement, the
Capex Statement shall become final, binding and conclusive upon the parties.
If EDandF gives a Capex Dispute Notice to Parent (which Capex Dispute Notice
must set forth, in reasonable detail, the items and amounts in dispute (the "
_Disputed Capex Items_ ")) within such 30-day period, EDandF and Parent shall
use reasonable efforts to resolve the Disputed 

  



        
   

  



  

Capex Items during the 45-day period commencing on the date Parent receives
the Capex Dispute Notice from EDandF. If the parties reach agreement with
respect to any Disputed Capex Items within such 45-day period, Parent shall
revise the Capex Statement to reflect such agreement.  If EDandF and Parent do
not obtain a final written resolution of all Disputed Capex Items within such
45-day period, then the unresolved Disputed Capex Items (" _Unresolved Capex
Items_ ") shall be submitted immediately to the Accounting Firm. The
Accounting Firm shall be required to render a determination regarding the
Unresolved Capex Items within 30 days after referral of the matter to the
Accounting Firm, or as soon as practicable thereafter, which determination
must be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in writing and
must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The determination
of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon EDandF, Parent and
the other parties hereto absent manifest error, and judgment may be entered
upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced.

  



  

(c) The Accounting Firm shall be required to make a determination with
respect only to the Unresolved Capex Items, and in a manner consistent with
this _Section 2.10_ and the Applicable Accounting Principles, and in no
event shall the Accounting Firms determination of Unresolved Capex Items be
for an amount outside the range of the parties disagreement. Each party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Accounting Firm such
work papers and other documents and information pertaining to the Unresolved
Capex Items as the Accounting Firm may request.

  



  

(d) Parent shall revise the Capex Statement to reflect the determination of
the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.10_.  The " _Actual Capital
Expenditures_ " shall mean the aggregate Capital Expenditures set forth on
the Capex Statement as revised pursuant to this _Section 2.10_.

  



  

(e) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne in the same
proportion as the aggregate dollar amount of the Unresolved Capex Items that
are unsuccessfully disputed by each party (as finally determined by the
Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all of the
Unresolved Capex Items submitted to the Accounting Firm.

  



  

(f) Until the Capex Statement is finalized pursuant to this _Section
2.10_, each party shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with,
make their working papers, books, records and employees available to and
otherwise assist each other party and its accountants and other
representatives at reasonable times during such other partys review of, and
the resolution of any objections with respect to, the Capex Statement.

  



  

(g) No later than three Business Days after the date on which the Capex
Statement is finalized pursuant to this _Section 2.10_, if the Budgeted
Capital Expenditures exceed the Actual Capital Expenditures (the amount of
such excess, the " _Capex Shortfall Amount_ "), EDandF and Parent shall, and
Parent shall cause Parent Founder to, execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
under the Stock Escrow Agreement an instruction letter referring to this
_Section 2.10_, stating that a Capex Shortfall Amount exists and instructing
the Escrow Agent to release from escrow and deliver to Parent for
cancellation

  



        
   

  



  

certificates representing that number of Series A Escrow Shares (rounded down
if such number is not a whole number) equal to the result of (x) the Capex
Shortfall Amount divided by (y) 5.5. Promptly upon receipt from the Escrow
Agent of such certificates, Parent shall mark such certificates "canceled"
and cancel and retire such Series A Escrow Shares and cause such cancellation
and retirement to be reflected on its stock ledger.  For this purpose, the
Series A Escrow Shares shall be canceled and retired at their initial
negotiated value and there shall be no right to substitute the Series A
Escrow Shares to be released with other property.

  



  

(h) Any release and cancellation of Series A Escrow Shares in respect of a
Capex Shortfall Amount pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Series A Merger Consideration for tax
reporting purposes. Notwithstanding anything in _Section 2.10(g)_ or  _(h)_
to the contrary, to the extent that it is commercially reasonable for EDandF
and Parent to determine the proportion of any Capex Shortfall Amount that
relates to the Purchased Companies, such amount shall be paid by EDandF or an
affiliate to Parent in cash within 10 business days after the date that the
Capex Statement is finalized pursuant to this _Section 2.10_, and the
cancellation of Series A Escrow Shares with respect to this amount shall not
occur unless such cash payment is not made to Parent within the allowable
time period. Any Capex Shortfall Amount allocated to the Purchased Companies
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Unadjusted Stock Sale Purchase Price
for tax reporting purposes.

  



  

Section 2.11. _Allocation of Merger Consideration_. Within 90 days following
execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than the Closing, the
parties hereto, acting reasonably, shall agree upon the allocation of
the Merger Consideration (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any amount
payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_ and any Series A Escrow
Shares released from escrow in respect of a Capex Shortfall Amount pursuant
to _Section 2.10_, as applicable) between Westway Terminal and Westway Feed
for all purposes. To the extent that interest accrues or a price adjustment
occurs following the final determination of the Final Merger Adjustment
Amount, the parties hereto shall promptly make appropriate adjustments to
such allocations, and such changed allocations shall then be the allocation
that each party uses for all purposes, including the filing of any Tax
Returns. No party to this Agreement may take any action that would call into
question the bona fides of such final allocation.

  



  

Section 2.12. _Delivery of Shares_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be delivered to Holdings all of the Common Stock Merger
Consideration and all of the Series A Merger Consideration with the exception
of the Series A Escrow Shares, which Parent shall cause to be deposited into
the Stock Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Stock Escrow
Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.13. _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. The numbers of warrants,
shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Series A Preferred Stock specified
in the recitals or any of the definitions set forth in _ARTICLE I_ or
required to be issued or exchanged hereunder shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change (but excluding any such action taken
in connection with

  



        
   

  



  

the Transaction) with respect to Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred
Stock on or after the date hereof and prior to the date of issuance or
payment thereof.

  



  

 _ARTICLE III_

  



  

THE STOCK SALE

  



  

Section 3.1. _Purchase and Sale of Stock_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, each EDandF Party shall,
and shall cause each Purchased Company Parent to, sell, assign, transfer,
deliver and convey to a Buying Subsidiary, and Parent shall cause a Buying
Subsidiary to purchase from such EDandF Party and such Purchased Company
Parent, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Purchased Companies owned by such EDandF Party and such Purchased Company
Parent, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances,
which shares will collectively constitute all of the shares of capital stock
of the Purchased Companies issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing.

  



  

Section 3.2. _Stock Sale Consideration_.

  



  

(a) The aggregate purchase price to be paid by Parent for the Purchased
Companies is $103,000,000 (the " _Unadjusted Stock Sale Purchase Price_ "),
subject to adjustment as set forth in this _Section 3.2_. As adjusted as
set forth in this _Section 3.2_, such aggregate purchase price is referred
to herein as the " _Adjusted Stock Sale Purchase Price_." For purposes of
this _Section 3.2_:

  



  

(i) " _Stock Sale Closing Date Net Indebtedness_ " means the amount required
to repay in full all Indebtedness of the Purchased Companies as of
immediately prior to the Closing less the Cash and Cash Equivalents of the
Purchased Companies as of immediately prior to the Closing, calculated in
accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles; _provided_ , _however_
, that Stock Sale Closing Date Net Indebtedness shall not include any
"reclass cash float" amounts to the extent such amounts are treated as a
liability for purposes of calculating Stock Sale Net Working Capital.

  



  

(ii) " _Stock Sale Net Working Capital_ " means the net working capital of
the Purchased Companies as of immediately prior to the Closing, calculated in
accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles and using the same line
items and sequence of calculation as set forth in the pro forma example of
the calculation of net working capital set forth in _Exhibit K-2_.

  



  

(iii) " _Stock Sale Adjustment Amount_ " means an amount equal to (x) the
Stock Sale Net Working Capital minus (y) the sum of (A) the Stock Sale
Closing Date Net Indebtedness and (B) the Stock Sale Reference Amount. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Stock Sale Adjustment Amount may be a negative
number.

  



  

(iv) " _Stock Sale Reference Amount_ " means negative $1,000,000.

  



         
 

  



  

(b) _Estimated Stock Sale Consideration; Payments_.

  



  

(i) At least ten days prior to the Closing Date, EDandF shall deliver to Parent
a statement (the " _Estimated Stock Sale Closing Statement_ ") consisting of
(x) an estimated combined balance sheet of the Purchased Companies as of the
Closing Date but without giving effect to the Closing in the form of, and
including the line items set forth in, _Exhibit L_ (the " _Estimated Stock
Sale Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (y) a good faith estimated calculation
in reasonable detail of the Stock Sale Adjustment Amount derived from
the Estimated Stock Sale Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Estimated Stock
Sale Adjustment Amount_ "). EDandF shall prepare the Estimated Stock Sale
Closing Statement in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles.

  



  

(ii) At the Closing, Parent shall pay, or shall cause one or more of its
Affiliates to pay, to EDandF or its designee by Wire Transfer an amount equal
to the sum of (x) the Unadjusted Stock Sale Purchase Price and (y) the
Estimated Stock Sale Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated Stock Sale
Consideration_ ").

  



  

(c) _Determination of the Final Statement of Stock Sale Adjustment Amount_.

  



  

(i) No later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to EDandF a statement (the " _Proposed Final Stock Sale Closing
Statement_ ") consisting of (x) a combined balance sheet of the Purchased
Companies as of the Closing Date but without giving effect to the Closing in
the same form and including the same line items as the Estimated Stock Sale
Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Stock Sale Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (y) a
proposed calculation in reasonable detail of the Stock Sale Adjustment Amount
derived from the Stock Sale Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Proposed Final
Stock Sale Adjustment Amount_ "). Parent shall prepare the Proposed Final
Stock Sale Closing Statement in accordance with the Applicable Accounting
Principles and shall cause it to be in the same form and include the same
line items as the Estimated Stock Sale Closing Statement.

  



  

(ii) If EDandF does not give written notice of dispute (a " _Stock
Sale Consideration Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent within 30 days after
receiving the Proposed Final Stock Sale Closing Statement, the parties hereto
agree that the Proposed Final Stock Sale Closing Statement shall become
final, binding and conclusive upon the parties. If EDandF gives a Stock Sale
Consideration Dispute Notice to Parent (which Stock Sale Consideration
Dispute Notice must set forth, in reasonable detail, the items and amounts in
dispute (the " _Disputed Stock Sale Items_ ")) within such 30-day period,
EDandF and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to resolve the Disputed Stock
Sale Items during the 45-day period commencing on the date Parent receives
such Stock Sale Consideration Dispute Notice from EDandF. EDandF, in preparing the
Stock Sale Consideration Dispute Notice, and Parent, in any response thereto,
may only object to the others proposal with respect to mathematical errors
and the calculations set forth in the Proposed Final Stock Sale Closing
Statement not being calculated in accordance with this _Section 3.2_.

  



        
   

  



  

If the parties reach agreement with respect to any Disputed Stock Sale Items
within such 45-day period, Parent shall revise the Proposed Final Stock Sale
Closing Statement to reflect such agreement. If EDandF and Parent do not obtain
a final written resolution of all Disputed Stock Sale Items within such
45-day period, then the unresolved Disputed Stock Sale Items (" _Unresolved
Stock Sale Items_ ") shall be submitted immediately to the Accounting Firm.
The Accounting Firm shall be required to render a determination regarding the
Unresolved Stock Sale Items within 30 days after referral of the matter to
the Accounting Firm, or as soon as practicable thereafter, which
determination must be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in
writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon
EDandF, Parent and the other parties hereto absent manifest error, and judgment
may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court
having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced.

  



  

(iii) The Accounting Firm shall be required to make a determination with
respect only to the Unresolved Stock Sale Items, and in a manner consistent
with this _Section 3.2_ and the Applicable Accounting Principles, and in no
event shall the Accounting Firms determination of Unresolved Stock Sale
Items be for an amount outside the range of the parties disagreement. Each
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Accounting Firm
such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to the
Unresolved Stock Sale Items as the Accounting Firm may request.

  



  

(iv) Parent shall revise the Proposed Final Stock Sale Closing Statement as
appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to
this _Section 3.2(c)_. The " _Final Stock Sale Adjustment Amount_ " shall
mean the Proposed Final Stock Sale Adjustment Amount as revised pursuant to
this _Section 3.2(c)_.

  



  

(v) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne in the same
proportion as the aggregate dollar amount of the Unresolved Stock Sale Items
that are unsuccessfully disputed by EDandF or Parent, as the case may be (as
finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar
amount of all of the Unresolved Stock Sale Items submitted to the Accounting
Firm.

  



  

(vi) Until the Final Stock Sale Adjustment Amount is finally determined, each
of Parent and EDandF shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate
with, make their working papers, books, records and employees available to
and otherwise assist each other party and its accountants and other
representatives at reasonable times during such other partys review of, and
the resolution of any objections with respect to, the Proposed Final Stock
Sale Closing Statement.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) _Post-Closing Stock Sale Adjustment Payment_. No later than three
Business Days after the date on which the Final Stock Sale Adjustment Amount
is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.9(c)_:

  



  

(i) if the Final Stock Sale Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Stock
Sale Adjustment Amount, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to EDandF or
its designee the amount of such excess by Wire Transfer; or

  



  

(ii) if the Estimated Stock Sale Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Stock
Sale Adjustment Amount, EDandF shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent or
its designee the amount of such excess by Wire Transfer.

  



  

(e) _Interest, etc_. Any amount payable pursuant to subclause (i) or
subclause (ii) of _Section 3.2(d)_ shall be increased by interest on such
amount, compounded daily, at the Interest Rate from the Closing Date to and
including the date of payment based on a 365 day year, with the amount of any
interest payable on the same date as the underlying amount pursuant to such
subclause (i) or subclause (ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
amount shall be paid pursuant to clauses (d) or (e) of this _Section
3.2_ until the Final Merger Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant
to _Section 2.9(c)_.

  



  

Section 3.3. _Allocation of Stock Sale Consideration_. Within 90
days following execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than the
Closing, the parties hereto, acting reasonably, shall agree upon the
allocation of (a) the Estimated Stock Sale Consideration, (b) any amount
payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_ and (c) any cash paid (or deemed paid)
to Parent in respect of a Capex Shortfall Amount pursuant to _Section 2.10_,
as applicable, among the Purchased Companies for all purposes. To the extent
that interest accrues or a price adjustment occurs following the final
determination of the Final Stock Sale Adjustment Amount, the parties hereto
shall promptly make appropriate adjustments to such allocations, and such
changed allocations shall then be the allocation that each party uses for all
purposes, including the filing of any Tax Returns. No party to this Agreement
will take any action that would call into question the bona fides of such
final allocation.

notice of, nor, to EDandFs Knowledge, is there, any violation or breach of, or
default under, any such Permit, easement, agreement or right or any federal,
state or municipal Law affecting any of the Real Property issued by any
Governmental Authority which has not been cured or contested in good faith,
nor any threatened or pending suit or other proceeding that would challenge
or threaten the lawful use and operation of the Real Property or ingress or
egress thereto in any manner described in clause (i) of this _Section
5.8(c)_, other than any violation, or breach or default which would,

other land use and similar applicable Laws affecting the Owned Real Property,

and complete list of all leases, subleases, licenses or other agreements (the

Transferred Company is a party (the " _Leased Real Property_ "). True, correct
and complete copies of all Leases and all amendments, modifications and
supplemental agreements thereto, to the extent in the Transferred Companies
possession, have previously been made available by EDandF to Parent.  Except

material eminent domain, condemnation or other similar proceedings pending or
threatened against such Transferred Company with respect to, or otherwise
affecting any portion of, the Leased Real Property. To EDandFs Knowledge, the
current use of the Leased Real Property in the conduct of the Business does
not violate any instrument of record or agreement affecting the Leased Real
Property to which any Transferred Company is a party and there is no
violation of any covenant, condition, restriction, easement or order of any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Leased Real Property or
the use or occupancy thereof, except for such violations as would not

thereof for its current use.

been threatened by any Governmental Authority or other Person;

  



  

(iii) no Releases of Hazardous Substances by the Transferred Companies or, to
EDandFs Knowledge, by any other Person, have occurred at or from any Owned

or leased by the Transferred Companies (while owned, operated or leased by
such Transferred Company), in each case that would reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability of the Transferred Company and which would,

Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(iv) to EDandFs Knowledge, none of the Transferred Companies has expressly
assumed or undertaken, or expressly agreed to assume or undertake,

not been delivered or made available on the electronic database to Parent at
least five days prior to the date of this Agreement; and

  



  

(vi) to EDandFs Knowledge, no facts, circumstances or conditions exist with
respect to any Transferred Company, the Business or any Owned Real Property,
Leased Real Property or former real property owned, operated or leased in
connection with the Business or a Transferred Company that would reasonably
be expected to result in any Transferred Company incurring unbudgeted costs
for Environmental Liabilities.

Transferred Company, any ERISA Affiliate, nor any employee of the foregoing,
nor, to EDandFs Knowledge, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary
thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined
in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) or any other activity
that could subject any thereof to any material tax or material penalty
(including the taxes or penalties on prohibited transactions imposed by Code
Section 4975) or any material sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA.

(j) Except as set forth in _Section 5.16(j)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the

employment or other services) cause the acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any award or entitlement under any EDandF U.S. Plan maintained by
the any of the Transferred Companies, or entitle any employee or other
individual to receive severance or other benefits compensation from any of
the Transferred Companies (i) which would not otherwise be payable absent the

involving any EDandF U.S. Plan and no threatened or pending material claims

Transferred Companies for the benefit of any employee of any of the
Transferred Companies or with respect to which the Transferred Companies have
any liability, including any such Plan required to be maintained or
contributed to by the law of the relevant jurisdiction, which would be
described in clause (a) of this _Section 5.16_, but for the fact that such
Plans are maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States (but
excluding plans maintained by a Governmental Authority), are listed in

Plans_"). With respect to each EDandF Non-U.S. Plan, (i) such plan complies in

Plan have been made or, if applicable, accrued in all material respects

accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect
to all current and former participants in such plan according to the
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used and consistent with
applicable Law to determine employer

there are no outstanding securities convertible into, exchangeable for or

subscriptions, warrants, options, rights (including preemptive rights), stock
appreciation rights, phantom stock interests, or other arrangements or
commitments obligating either Parent or a Merger Sub to issue or dispose of
any of its respective equity securities or any ownership interest therein.
The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not cause any
Encumbrances to be created or suffered on the capital stock of either Parent
or a Merger Sub, other than Encumbrances created by an EDandF Party. There are
no existing agreements, subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments,
trusts (voting or otherwise), or rights of any kind whatsoever between Parent

outstanding contractual obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock of or other equity
interests in Parent and/or any of its Subsidiaries.

the matters disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule, (iii) for liabilities and
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since December 31, 2007, (iv) for liabilities and obligations
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and (v) for liabilities that would not reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Merger Subs has no assets
or properties of any kind, does not now conduct and has never conducted
any business, and has and will have at Closing no obligations or liabilities
of any nature whatsoever except such obligations and liabilities as are
imposed under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

the Parent SEC Documents, since December 31, 2007, Parent and the Merger Subs
have conducted business only in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and there has been no Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor
has any event or circumstance occurred that would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing, since
December 31, 2007, there has not occurred any action, event, development,
occurrence or failure to act that, if it had occurred after the date hereof,
would have required the consent of EDandF pursuant to _Section 7.2_.

  



  

Section 6.10. _Litigation_. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents,
as of the date hereof, there is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to Parents
Knowledge, overtly threatened, against Parent or a Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates at law, in equity or otherwise, in, before, or by,
any Governmental Authority, other than which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have, or reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. There are no judgments or outstanding orders, injunctions,
decrees, stipulations or awards against Parent or a Merger Sub except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 6.11. _Compliance with Laws_. Except as set forth in the Parent
SEC Documents, the business of Parent and the Merger Subs is being conducted
in accordance with all applicable Laws, except for such violations of Law
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have, or reasonably be
expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of
formation of Parent, neither Parent nor a Merger Sub has received any written
notice of any violation of Law, except for such violations of Law which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.  All Governmental Actions/Filings required by
Parent and the Merger Subs have been obtained and are in full force and
effect and are being complied with in all respects except for such which

ERISA Affiliates do not maintain, sponsor or contribute to, and have
no liability under or with respect to, any Plan and neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with
another event, such as termination of employment or other services) (i)
result in any payment or benefit becoming due to any current or former
stockholder, director, agent, consultant or employee of Parent or a Merger
Sub, or (ii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of

aggregate, would not have, or reasonably be expected to have, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, there are no outstanding claims against Parent or a
Merger Sub (whether under regulation, contract, policy or otherwise) asserted
by or on behalf of any present or former employee or job applicant of Parent
or a Merger Sub on account of or for (i) overtime pay, other than overtime

other legal restraint or prohibition entered or imposed by any court or other
Governmental Authority that is not yet final and nonappealable.

to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding
by any Governmental Authority or other Person is commenced which questions
the validity or legality of the Mergers, the Stock Sale or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
or seeks damages in connection therewith, the parties agree to cooperate and
use commercially reasonable efforts to defend against such claim, action,
suit, investigation or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other order

promptly provide the other parties hereto with copies of any
such announcement. This _Section 7.4_ shall not apply to communications by

extent any such Prior Period Return could materially increase the Tax
liability of the Transferred Companies or their Affiliates for

  



        
   

  



  

periods beginning after the Closing Date, the draft of any such Prior Period
Return shall be subject to Parents review and approval, which approval shall

Return. Any dispute between the parties shall be resolved in accordance with
procedures similar to those set forth in _Section 2.9(c)(ii)_ and _Section
3.2(c)(ii)_.

  



  

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law or administrative practice, the
taxable year of any Transferred Company that includes the Closing Date shall
be treated as closing on (and including) the Closing Date.  In the case
where applicable Law does not permit a Transferred Company to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period, and to determine
the responsibility for Taxes attributable to the Transferred Companies for a
Straddle Period under this Agreement, the portion of any such Taxes that are
allocable to the EDandF shall:  (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x)
based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with
any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment
of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) other than Transfer
Taxes (as defined below), be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable
if the taxable year ended at the end of the Closing Date and (ii) in the case
of Taxes (other than those described in clause (i)) imposed on a periodic
basis with respect to the business or assets of any of the Transferred
Companies or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding taxable period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period. For purposes of clause
(i) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item
that is calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation
and amortization deductions) shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by
multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period
times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital
(including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount of such
capital thereof required to be allocated under this _Section 7.5(b) _shall
be computed by reference to the amount shown on any relevant Tax Return.
Parent shall be responsible for all other Taxes attributable to a Straddle
Period. Parent shall provide to EDandF all Straddle Period Returns (including a
computation of the portion of the Tax shown on such Tax Return that Parent
believes is the responsibility of EDandF (" _ED andFs Portion_")) within 30 days
of the due date for such returns, including extensions, for EDandFs review and
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. EDandF shall
pay the excess of EDandFs Portion (or in the case of a dispute, the
undisputed amount of the EDandFs Portion) over the amount of Tax taken into
account in determining Merger Closing Date Net Indebtedness and the

  



        
   

  



  

Stock Sale Closing Date Net Indebtedness to Parent no later than three
Business Days prior to the due date of any Straddle Period Return.  If the
parties hereto cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall
be resolved in accordance with procedures similar to those set forth in
_Section 2.9(c)(ii)_ and _Section 3.2(c)(ii)_. If the Accounting Firm is
unable to make a determination with respect to any disputed issue within
three Business Days prior to the due date (including extensions) for the
filing of the Tax Return in question, then Parent may file such Tax Return on
the due date (including extensions) therefor without such determination
having been made and without EDandFs consent. Notwithstanding the filing of
such Tax Return, the Accounting Firm shall make a determination with respect
to any disputed issue, and the amount of Taxes for which EDandF is responsible
shall be as determined by the Accounting Firm (less any amount
previously paid by EDandF with respect to such Tax Return). No later than three
days after the Accounting Firms determination, EDandF shall pay Parent in
immediately available funds the amount of EDandFs additional Tax liability as
determined by the Accounting Firm. No payment pursuant to this _Section
7.5(b)_ shall excuse EDandF from its indemnification obligations pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)_ if the amount of Taxes as ultimately determined (on audit
or otherwise) for the Straddle Period that are the responsibility of EDandF
exceeds the amount of EDandFs payment under this _Section 7.5(b)_.

  



  

(c) Parent shall promptly notify EDandF following receipt of any notice of
audit or other proceeding relating to any of the Prior Period Returns or
Straddle Period Returns or any other federal, state, foreign or local
corporation income or franchise Tax Return of any Transferred Company filed
on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of
Parent to give EDandF prompt notice as provided herein shall not relieve EDandF
of its indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that EDandF
is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.  EDandF shall have the right to
control any and all audits or other proceedings relating to any Prior Period
Return other than any such audit or proceeding that could result in a Loss to
a Parent Indemnified Party that would not be indemnifiable pursuant to this
Agreement (as determined in good faith by EDandF and Parent, in which case
Parent shall agree in writing to forego the amount of any indemnity claim
against any EDandF Party that would not otherwise have been indemnifiable
pursuant to this Agreement, after a final determination in respect of such
audit or proceeding had EDandF controlled such audit or proceeding );
_provided_ , _however_ , that EDandF shall not settle, compromise or concede
any such audit or proceeding without the written consent of Parent (whose
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if such settlement,
compromise or concession involves an issue that recurs in taxable periods of
Parent (or any of its Affiliates) or any of the Transferred Companies or
could increase by more than $10,000 the Tax liability of Parent (or any of
its Affiliates) or any of the Transferred Companies for any taxable period
ending after the Closing Date. Parent shall have the right to control any and
all audits or other proceedings relating to any Tax Return required
or permitted to be filed for taxable periods that end after the Closing
Date, including any Straddle Period Return; provided, however, that Parent
shall not settle, compromise or concede any such audit or proceeding without
the prior written consent of EDandF (whose consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) if such settlement, compromise or concession could
increase by more than $10,000 the Tax liability of EDandF (or any of its
Affiliates) or any

  



        
   

  



  

of the Transferred Companies for any Straddle Period or any taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) Any Tax sharing agreement in effect at the Closing Date shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date as to the Transferred Companies, and no
additional amounts shall be due from or due to the Transferred Companies
after the Closing Date pursuant to any Tax sharing agreement and the
Transferred Companies shall not have any liability in respect of such
agreement.

  



  

(e) The parties hereto shall preserve and cause to be preserved all
information, Tax Returns, books, records and documents relating to any Tax
liability with respect to a taxable period until the later of the expiration
of all applicable statutes of limitation and extensions thereof, or the
conclusion of all litigation with respect to Taxes for such period. The
parties hereto shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other (and to
each others accountants and attorneys), upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Transferred
Companies or the Business (including access to books and records as well as
the timely provision of powers of attorney or similar authorizations) as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any
election related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing
authority and the prosecution or defense of any audit, proposed adjustment or
deficiency, assessment, claim, suit or other proceeding relating to any Taxes
or Tax Return (each, a " _Tax Proceeding_ "), including the retention and
(upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material so provided.

  



  

(f) On or prior to the Closing Date, EDandF shall file (or cause to be filed)
one or more elections under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i)
to treat each of the Purchased Companies (other than EDandF Man Liquid
Products Inc.) as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
which election shall be effective no later than the date which is two days
prior to the Closing Date. EDandF shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
continue EDandF Man Liquid Products Inc. into the Canadian provincial
jurisdiction of Nova Scotia and to convert such entity into an unlimited
liability company prior to the Closing, and shall file (or cause to be filed)
the election described in the prior sentence to treat such unlimited
liability company as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. EDandF and Parent shall cooperate to determine whether to complete
and file an election under Treasury Regulations section 301.7701-3(c)(1) to
treat Champion Liquid Feeds Pty. Ltd. as a pass-through entity for U.S.
federal income tax purposes within seventy (70) days of the Closing Date and,
if agreed, procure all necessary signatures and file such an election with an
effective date no later than two days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(g) The parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of
all returns, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer, transfer gains or similar taxes which become payable in connection
with the Mergers or the Stock Sale pursuant to this Agreement (collectively,
" _Transfer Taxes_ "). The parties further agree, upon reasonable request,
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any

  



        
   

  



  

certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer
Taxes that could be imposed. Parent will supply EDandF with all necessary
documentation and forms that are needed to support the qualification of the
Mergers as reorganizations under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. From and
after the date of this Agreement each of the Parties will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, (i) act in a manner consistent with the treatment of the
Mergers contemplated by this Agreement as reorganizations under Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and (ii) consistently take the position on all Tax
Returns, before any taxing authority, and in any judicial proceeding, that
the Mergers contemplated by this Agreement qualify as reorganizations under
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

  



  

(h) On or prior to the Closing Date, the boards of directors of each of
Parent, the Merger Subs, and EDandF shall adopt this Agreement as a "Plan
of Reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-3(a).

  



  

(i) Unless specific written consent is provided by EDandF (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (a) the Merger Subs shall continue
to be treated as disregarded from Parent for U.S. federal income tax purposes
for two (2) years following the Closing Date and (b) Parent shall take
no action that would cause the Mergers to fail to meet the "continuity
of enterprise" requirement of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)
as interpreted under applicable Law.

  



  

(j) Prior to the Closing, Holdings shall deliver to Parent (i) a duly and
properly executed certification of non-foreign status executed by Holdings,
in form and substance consistent with Treasury Regulations section
1.1445-2(b) stating that Holdings is not a "Foreign Person" as defined in
section 1445 of the Code (it being understood and agreed by the parties that
the failure to provide such certificate shall result in Parent and/or a
Merger Sub withholding (or causing to be withheld) under Section 1445 of the
Code).

  



  

(k) EDandF shall provide (or shall cause the applicable Transferred Company to
provide) to Parent a copy of any income Tax Return filed by a Transferred
Company from the date hereof until the Closing Date no later than five (5)
Business Days after the filing of any such Tax Return.

  



  

(l) If Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (including the Transferred
Companies) receives any refund or credits of any Taxes attributable to any
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any Straddle Period (to the
extent such Taxes would be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date in accordance with _Section 7.5(b)_) of any
Transferred Company, Parent shall promptly pay to EDandF the amount of any such
refund or credits of Taxes (including any interest received or credited in
respect thereof reduced by reasonable direct expenses or costs incurred in
obtaining the refund), except to the extent such refund relates to or is
attributable to the carryback of any credit, loss, deduction or other Tax
items arising in any period beginning after the Closing Date or any Straddle
Period to the extent such item would be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending after the Closing Date in accordance with _Section
7.5(b)_. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any refunds or credits of
Taxes taken

  



        
   

  



  

into account in determining Merger Closing Date Net Indebtedness or Stock
Sale Closing Date Net Indebtedness shall remain the property of the
Transferred Companies and not be payable to EDandF under this _Section
7.5(l)_. For purposes of this _Section 7.5(l)_, the term "refund" shall
include a reduction in Taxes and the use of an overpayment of Taxes as an
audit or other Tax offset, and receipt of a refund shall occur upon the
filing of a return or an adjustment thereto using such reduction, overpayment
or offset, or upon the receipt of cash.

  



  

(m) In respect of the sale of the shares of ED and F Man Liquid Products Inc.
(or a successor entity) in accordance with _Section 3.1_:

  



  

(i) each of the Purchased Company Parents of ED and F Man Liquid Products Inc.
will apply as soon as possible to the Canada Revenue Agency for a tax
clearance certificate pursuant to subsection 116(1) of the _Income Tax Act_
(Canada);

  



  

(ii) each of the Purchased Company Parents of ED and F Man Liquid Products Inc.
will provide to Parent and the relevant Buying Subsidiary within 20 Business
Days from the date of this Agreement reasonably available (A) evidence
that each such Purchased Company Parent is resident in a jurisdiction which
has entered into a bilateral tax treaty with Canada, and (B) evidence that
the shares of ED and F Man Liquid Products Inc. (or a successor entity),
on Closing, will not derive the greater part of their value from
immovable property situated in Canada (excepting immovable property in which
the business of ED and F Man Liquid Products Inc. (or a successor entity) is
carried on).

  



  

(iii) to the extent Parent is satisfied, acting reasonably and in good faith,
with the evidence provided pursuant to clause (ii) so that subsection
116(5.01) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) can apply to the sale of the
shares in ED and F Man Liquid Products Inc. (or a successor entity), the
relevant Buying Subsidiary shall refrain from withholding any amount from the
Estimated Stock Sale Purchase Price payable for such shares; and

  



  

(iv) in the event Parent is not satisfied, acting reasonably and in good
faith, with the evidence provided pursuant to clause (ii), Parent will give
notice to that effect to EDandF not less than 20 Business Days prior to
Closing, whereupon the Parent, the relevant Buying Subsidiary and EDandF will
negotiate in good faith and, to the extent a tax clearance certificate
pursuant to subsection 116(1) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) has not
been issued prior to the Closing, will enter into an escrow agreement to
govern the escrow, investment, remittance and release of any withheld funds.
In no event will any amount withheld in connection with section 116 of the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada) exceed 25% of the Purchase Price allocable to the
shares of ED and F Man Liquid Products Inc. (or a successor entity).  In no
event will any amount be remitted to the Canada Revenue Agency which is in
excess of the minimum amount required by law or at a time prior to the due
date imposed under applicable law, as modified by administrative practice
(including by a comfort letter issued by the Canada Revenue Agency).

  



         
 

  



  

Section 7.6. _Foreign Transfer Agreements_. As promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, the EDandF Parties, on the one hand, and Parent and the Merger
Subs, on the other hand, shall cooperate in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Foreign Transfer Agreements to
be prepared and, prior to or on the Closing Date, executed by the applicable
EDandF Party or Affiliate thereof and Parent or an Affiliate of Parent
designated for such purpose by Parent (a " _Buying Subsidiary_ "). The
parties agree that (i) the Foreign Transfer Agreements are not intended to
expand or limit the rights and obligations of the EDandF Parties or their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, either Merger Sub and any Buying
Subsidiary on the other hand, beyond those provided for in this Agreement,
and (ii) except as may be required by Law, the Foreign Transfer Agreements
shall not provide any rights or obligations of the EDandF Parties or their
Affiliates, or Parent or the Buying Subsidiaries, in addition to those that
are provided in this Agreement. The parties further agree that the Foreign
Transfer Agreements shall allocate the Estimated Stock Sale Consideration and
the Final Stock Sale Adjustment Amount in accordance with _Section 3.3_ and
that, if there is an adjustment to the payment made on account of
the Unadjusted Stock Sale Purchase Price under _Section 3.2_ which relates
to a part of the capital stock of a Transferred Company that is the subject
of a Foreign Transfer Agreement, then, if required to implement
the adjustment and so far as permissible under the Law of the
relevant jurisdiction, EDandF or the relevant Purchase Company Parent and
Parent or the relevant Buying Subsidiary shall enter into a supplemental
agreement reflecting such adjustment and the allocation of such adjustment.
In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Foreign Transfer
Agreements and this Agreement, the parties agree and acknowledge that the
terms of this Agreement shall control and that, if necessary, the parties
shall deliver such additional instruments as may be reasonably necessary to
accomplish the foregoing, so far as permissible under the Law of the relevant
jurisdiction.  The EDandF Parties shall not bring any claim against Parent or
any Buying Subsidiary, and Parent and the Buying Subsidiaries shall not bring
any claim against any EDandF Party, in respect of or based upon the
Foreign Transfer Agreements except to the extent necessary to implement any
transfer of a Transferred Company in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.7. _Consents and Waivers_. The EDandF Parties and Parent shall use
(and the EDandF Parties shall cause each of the Transferred Companies to use)
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable
date all consents, waivers, approvals and notices required to consummate, or
in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except
for such matters covered by _Section 7.3_ and except for such consents,
waivers and approvals as may be required from Affiliates of EDandF, which shall
be obtained immediately prior to the Closing Date). Any such
consents, waivers, approvals and notices shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to EDandF and Parent, and executed counterparts of any
consents, waivers and approvals shall be delivered to the other party
promptly after receipt thereof, and copies of such notices shall be delivered
to the other party promptly after the making thereof.  Any costs incurred as
payments to any Person with respect to such consents, waivers, approvals and
notices shall be borne by Parent; _provided_   _however_ , that any such
costs shall be borne by Parent only after the Closing. In the event the
Closing does not occur, any such costs shall be borne by the Person incurring
such costs.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 7.8. _Post-Closing Obligations of Parent and the Surviving LLCs to
Certain Employees_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, continue to provide the
Transferred Employees, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement (or such
earlier date as the applicable Transferred Employees employment terminates),
with annual base pay, annual bonus opportunities and benefits that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the applicable
Transferred Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to provide
equity-based compensation to the Transferred Employees.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and/or its Affiliates shall have the same right to amend,
modify or terminate any such base pay, bonus, benefit or other compensatory
arrangement after the Effective Time as the applicable Transferred Company
had under the terms of the applicable plan or under applicable Law. Parent
shall or shall cause its Affiliates to credit Transferred Employees for
services performed with the Transferred Companies or their Affiliates on and
prior to the Effective Time for purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit
accrual (or calculation of compensation and benefits to the extent service is
taken into account under the applicable plan or agreement) (including for
purposes of determining an individuals paid time off, severance as set forth
in _Section 7.8(b)_, short-term and long-term disability benefits, matching
or other employer-provided credits or contributions under any tax qualified
defined contribution retirement plan, and payments or benefits under any
loyalty award program (or similar program) (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under any applicable Plan
including any Plan sponsored by Parent that is a tax-qualified pension plan,
provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits to any Transferred Employee with
respect to the same period of service for such Transferred Employee.

  



  

(b) Parent shall or shall cause its Affiliates to provide each Transferred
Employee whose employment terminates (in a manner that would have entitled
such Transferred Employee to severance payments and benefits under any
Transferred Companys applicable severance plan as in effective on the date
of this Agreement as disclosed in _Section 7.8(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Severance Plans_ ")) during the one year period from and
after the Closing with severance payments and benefits, calculated based on
service earned with the Transferred Companies or any Affiliate, at least
equal to the severance payments and benefits such employee would have
received under the applicable Transferred Companys severance plan applicable
to such Transferred Employee, but only to the extent such plan is listed in
_Section 7.8(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule and provided further that Parent
and/or its Affiliates shall have the same right to amend, modify or terminate
such Severance Plans after the Effective Time as the Transferred Company had
under the terms of the applicable plan or under applicable Law.

  



  

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods and
service requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Transferred Employees under any Plan and (ii) provide each
Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Closing for the calendar year in which

  



        
   

  



  

the Closing occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any analogous Plan.

  



  

(d) The EDandF Parties shall be solely responsible for (i) claims for the
type of benefits described in Section 3(1) of ERISA whether or not
covered by ERISA (" _Welfare Benefits_ ") that are incurred under any Plans
by or with respect to any Transferred Employee or his or her beneficiaries
or dependents on or before the Closing Date and (ii) claims relating
to continuation coverage under COBRA attributable to "qualifying events"
with respect to any Transferred Employee or his or her beneficiaries and
dependents that occur on or before the Closing Date.

  



  

(e) Parent and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for (i) claims for
Welfare Benefits that are incurred by or with respect to any Transferred
Employee or his or her beneficiaries or dependents after the Closing Date and
(ii) claims relating to continuation coverage under COBRA attributable to
"qualifying events" with respect to any Transferred Employee or his or her
beneficiaries and dependents that occur following the Closing Date.

  



  

(f) For purposes of this _Section 7.8_, a medical, dental or vision
claim shall be considered incurred when the services are rendered, the
supplies are provided or medications are prescribed, and not when the
condition arose. A disability claim shall be considered incurred when the
disability claim is properly filed.

  



  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the ability of Parent or its
Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee for any
reason at any time after the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section 7.8_
or any other provision of this Agreement shall (i) be construed to establish,
amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement (including any EDandF Plan transferred to Parent or any of its
Affiliates) or (ii) limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Effective Time, the Transferred Companies) to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained
by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including any EDandF Plan transferred to
Parent or any of its Affiliates).

  



  

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Transferred Companies shall cause
the sponsorship of each of the Plans sponsored or maintained by the
Transferred Companies, that are qualified defined benefit pension plans
covering Transferred Employees in the U.S. (all of which are set forth in
_Section 7.8(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedule and are referred to hereinafter,
collectively, as the " _Transferred Plans_ ") to be assumed by EDandF or any of
its Affiliates (provided such Affiliate is not a Transferred Company) and
(ii) the Transferred Companies shall transfer all assets (or, as applicable,
the Transferred Companies rights in the trusts holding such assets),
liabilities, rights and obligations relating to the Transferred Plans to EDandF
or any of its Affiliates (provided such Affiliate is not a Transferred
Company). Prior to the Effective Time, the Transferred Companies shall also
cause the transfer of all records, consents and election forms with respect
to the Transferred Plans to EDandF or any of its Affiliates (provided such
Affiliate is not a Transferred Company). Prior to the Effective Time, neither
EDandF nor any of its

  



        
   

  



  

Affiliates will take any action to terminate any of the Transferred Plans
pursuant to Section 4041 of ERISA.  From and after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) shall have any liability under or attributable to the Transferred
Plans or any other qualified defined benefit pension plan of EDandF. EDandF
shall take all actions necessary so that each of the Transferred Companies
ceases to be a participating employer in the EDandF Man Holdings, Inc.
Retirement Income Plan prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(i) With respect to Transferred Employees who are covered by a collective
bargaining agreement listed in _Section 5.19(a)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules or any replacement, renewal or extension of any such
agreement, Parent agrees to honor or cause to be honored all such agreements
and provide such Transferred Employees with compensation and benefits as set
forth in such agreements, including benefits under any Multiemployer Plan.

  



  

(j) EDandF shall take, or cause to be taken, all such action as may be
necessary so that effective at or prior to the Effective Time, (i) either (A)
Westway Terminal or Westway Feed shall become the plan sponsor of the
tax qualified defined contribution retirement plan in which Transferred
Employees in the United States currently participate (the "401(k) Plan") and,
in accordance with section 414(l) of the Code, the assets in the trust of
the 401(k) Plan that relate to individuals who are not Transferred
Employees shall be transferred from the 401(k) Plan to a new tax qualified
defined contribution retirement plan to be established by EDandF or an
Affiliate thereof that is not a Transferred Company, or (B) Westway
Terminal or Westway Feed shall establish a new tax qualified defined
contribution retirement plan substantially similar to the 401(k) Plan and the
assets in the trust of the 401(k) Plan that relate to individuals who are
Transferred Employees shall be transferred from the 401(k) Plan to such new
plan in accordance with section 414(l) of the Code, (ii) the benefit plans
that provide life insurance, health care, dental care, accidental death and
dismemberment insurance, disability, severance benefits and other group
welfare benefits in which the Transferred Employees in the United States
currently participate are assumed by one of the Transferred Companies (or
substantially similar plans shall be established by a Transferred Company)
and (iii) any related third-party administration agreements shall be assigned
to or established by a Transferred Company.

  



  

(k) EDandF shall take, or cause to be taken, all such action as may be
necessary in accordance with all applicable Law so that effective prior to
the Effective Time, (i) either (A) a Transferred Company becomes the plan
sponsor of the defined contribution retirement plan in which Transferred
Employees in Canada currently participate (the "Canadian Plan") and, in
accordance with applicable law, the assets in the trust of the Canadian Plan
that relate to individuals who are not Transferred Employees are transferred
from the Canadian Plan to a new defined contribution retirement plan to be
established by EDandF or an Affiliate thereof that is not a Transferred
Company, or (B) a Transferred Company establishes a new defined contribution
retirement plan substantially similar to the Canadian Plan and the assets in
the trust of the Canadian Plan that relate to individuals who are Transferred
Employees are transferred from the Canadian Plan to such new plan in
accordance with applicable law, (ii) the benefit plans that provide life
insurance, medical coverage, accidental death and dismemberment

  



        
   

  



  

insurance, disability and other group welfare benefits in which
the Transferred Employees in Canada currently participate are assumed by one
of the Transferred Companies (or substantially similar plans are established
by a Transferred Company) and (iii) any related third-party
administration agreements are assigned to or established by a Transferred
Company.

  



  

(l) With respect to Transferred Employees of Agman Holdings Limited (the "
_UK Employees_ "), notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
7.8_, EDandF and Parent shall take all actions necessary in accordance with
all applicable Law so that (i) such employees remain employed by
Agman Holdings Limited immediately following the Effective Time, but are
seconded to Westway Terminals UK in accordance with the terms of the Shared
Services Agreement, (ii) subject to the provision of the Shared Services
Agreement, the UK Employees continue to participate in all benefit plans such
employees participated in immediately prior to the Effective Time to the
extent such plans continue to be maintained by Agman Holdings Limited,
_provided_ that following the Effective Time, UK Employees will no longer
participate in the Axa PPP UK Medical Insurance Scheme maintained by Agman
Holdings Limited but will instead participate in a substantially similar plan
established by Parent or one of its Affiliates to be effective as of the
Effective Time and (iii) any automobile lease used by UK Employees
immediately prior to the Effective is transferred to Parent or one of its

(as well as all assets and liabilities) of all benefit plans maintained by

Westway Terminals Hibernian Limited adopts benefit plans substantially
similar to the benefits plans maintained by Westway Terminals Hibernian

(p) EDandF shall take all actions necessary in accordance with all applicable
Law to provide that the employees listed in _Section 7.8(p)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule cease to be employees of any of the Transferred

(q) With respect to any Transferred Employees that have a right to
information and consultation under applicable law due to the transactions

reasonable efforts to cooperate to provide such information and consultation
within the applicable time periods.

until the Effective Time, EDandF shall cause the Transferred Companies to
maintain in full force and effect the policies of insurance listed in _Section
5.21_ of the Disclosure Schedule, subject only to variations required by the
ordinary operation of their businesses, or else will obtain, prior to the
lapse of any such policy, the same or, if not available upon commercially
reasonable economic terms and conditions, substantially similar coverage with
insurers of recognized standing and approved in advance writing by Parent,
which approval Parent will not unreasonably withhold or delay.  EDandF shall
promptly advise Parent in advance in writing of any change of insurer or
material change of type of coverage in respect of the policies listed in
_Section 5.21_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

Section 7.10. _Proxy Statement; Parent Stockholders  Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
prepare and file a proxy statement of Parent with the SEC (as such proxy
statement is amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") for the
purpose of soliciting proxies from Parents stockholders to obtain the
requisite approval of the transactions contemplated hereby and the other
matters to be voted on at a meeting of the holders of Parent Common Stock to
be called and held for such purpose (the " _Parent Stockholders  Meeting_").
As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent
shall prepare and file any other filings required under the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act or any other Laws relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby (collectively, the " _Other Filings_ "). Parent shall notify EDandF
promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of
any request by the SEC or its staff or any other Governmental Authority for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing or for
additional information. As promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
Parent shall provide EDandF and its counsel with copies of all written
correspondence between Parent or any of its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC, or its staff or other

  



        
   

  



  

government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement
or any Other Filing. Parent shall permit EDandF and its counsel to participate
in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and any exhibits, amendment or
supplement thereto and shall consult with EDandF and its advisors concerning
any comments from the SEC with respect thereto and shall not file the Proxy
Statement or any exhibits, amendment or supplement thereto or any response
letters to any comments from the SEC without the prior written consent of
EDandF, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall be permitted to make such filing or response in
the absence of such consent if the basis of EDandFs failure to consent is
EDandFs unwillingness to permit the inclusion in such filing or response of
information that, based on the advice of outside counsel to Parent, is
required by the SEC and United States securities Laws to be included therein.
Parent agrees that the Proxy Statement and the Other Filings will comply in
all material respects with all applicable Laws and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which would reasonably be
expected to result in the Proxy Statement containing any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, Parent or EDandF, as the case may be, shall promptly
inform the other party of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing
to stockholders of Parent, an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement.
The Proxy Statement will be sent to the stockholders of Parent for the
purpose of soliciting proxies from holders of Parent Common Stock to vote at
the Parent Stockholders Meeting in favor of: (i) the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Parent
Stockholder Approval_ "); (ii) the change of the name of Parent to "Westway
Group, Inc."; (iii) the amendment and restatement of Parents certificate
of incorporation in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_; (iv)
the issuance and sale of shares of Parent Common Stock to the extent that
such issuance requires stockholder approval under the rules of any
stock exchange on which Parents common stock is or will be listed; (v)
the election of the Proposed Initial Directors to serve as the Board of
Directors of Parent, effective immediately following the Closing; and (vi)
the adjournment of the special meeting and (vii) the adoption of an
Equity Incentive Plan, in a form to be agreed upon by Parent and EDandF (the
matters described in clauses (i) through (vii), the " _Voting Matters_ ").

  



  

(b) As soon as practicable following its approval by the SEC, Parent shall
distribute the Proxy Statement to the holders of Parent Common Stock and,
pursuant thereto, shall call the Parent Stockholders Meeting in accordance
with the DGCL and, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, solicit
proxies from such holders to vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
and the approval of the Transaction and the other Voting Matters.

  



  

(c) Parent shall comply, and EDandF shall provide Parent, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, with such information concerning the Transferred
Companies reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary for the
information concerning the Transferred Companies in the Proxy Statement and
the Other Filings to comply, with all applicable provisions of and rules
under the Exchange Act and all applicable provisions of the DGCL in the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, the

  



        
   

  



  

solicitation of proxies thereunder, and the calling and holding of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall ensure
that the Proxy Statement does not, as of the date on which it is distributed
to the holders of Parent Common Stock, and as of the date of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (
_provided_ that Parent shall not be responsible for the accuracy or
completeness of any information relating to the Transferred Companies or any
other information furnished in writing by EDandF for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement).

  



  

(d) Subject to the fiduciary duties of its board of directors, Parent shall
include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of its board of directors
that the holders of Parent Common Stock vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Transaction and the other Voting Matters,
and shall otherwise use best efforts to obtain the Parent Stockholder
Approval.

  



  

Section 7.11. _Form 8-K Filings_. Parent and EDandF shall cooperate in
good faith with respect to the preparation of, and as promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall file with the SEC, a
Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act to report the
execution of this Agreement. Parent and EDandF shall cooperate in good faith
with respect to the preparation of, and at least five days prior to the
Closing, Parent shall prepare a draft Form 8-K announcing the Closing,
together with, or incorporating by reference, the financial statements
prepared by EDandF and its accountant, (" _Transaction Form 8-K_ "). Prior to
Closing, Parent and EDandF shall prepare the press release announcing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Press Release_ ").
Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent shall file the Transaction Form 8-K
with the SEC and distribute the Press Release.

  



  

Section 7.12. _Certain Transfers_.

  



  

(a) Prior to or at the Closing, EDandF shall cause to be transferred or
assigned to a Transferred Company (i) all Intellectual Property owned by EDandF
or an Affiliate of EDandF (other than a Transferred Company) that is used
solely in the Business, (ii) all rights in and to the name "Westway" owned
by EDandF or an Affiliate of EDandF (other than a Transferred Company), (iii)
each Contract to which EDandF or an Affiliate of EDandF (other than
a Transferred Company) is a party that relates solely to the use of
Intellectual Property in connection with the Business; _provided_ , _however_
, that upon Closing, EDandF and its Affiliates shall have an "as is," non-
exclusive, fully-paid up, worldwide, sublicenseable license to use the
Westway name and any common law trademark rights associated therewith in the
same manner as used prior to Closing for twelve (12) months immediately
following the Closing Date and (iv) the Contracts or other assets and related
liabilities listed in _Section 7.12(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, EDandF shall cause to be transferred or
assigned to EDandF or an Affiliate of EDandF that is not a Transferred Company
(i) all Intellectual Property that is owned by a Transferred Company and used
by EDandF and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) for
purposes unrelated to the Business, (ii) each

  



        
   

  



  

Contract to which a Transferred Company is a party that relates
to Intellectual Property used by EDandF and its Affiliates (other than
the Transferred Companies) for purposes unrelated to the Business and (iii)
the Contracts or other assets and related liabilities listed in _Section
7.12(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(c) At any time during the 60 days immediately following the date hereof,
EDandF may amend:

  



  

(i) _Section 7.12(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule to (x) add or revise a
description therein of any Intellectual Property, Contract or other asset the
failure of which description to be included therein, or the failure of which
description to be so revised, would cause the representation and warranty in
the second sentence of _Section 5.7_ to be inaccurate, or (y) remove or
revise the description therein of any Intellectual Property, Contract or
other asset if the inclusion of or failure to revise such description would
result in the transfer or assignment to a Transferred Company of any
Intellectual Property, Contract or other asset that does not constitute a
part of the Business as of the date hereof; or

  



  

(ii) _Section 7.12(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule to remove or revise the
description therein of any Intellectual Property, Contract or other asset the
inclusion of which description, or the failure of which description to be so
revised, would cause the representation and warranty in the second sentence
of _Section 5.7_ to be inaccurate.

  



  

For all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of (1)
determining the fulfillment of the condition precedent set forth in _Section
8.2(a)_ and (2) _Section 10.2_, any such amendment shall be given effect
as if it had been made on the date hereof.

  



  

Section 7.13. _No Claim Against Trust Account_. Notwithstanding anything
else in this Agreement, the EDandF Parties acknowledge that they have read
Parents final prospectus dated May 24, 2007 (the " _Prospectus_ ") and
understand that Parent has established the trust account at First
Republic Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust (the "
_Trust Account_ "), initially set in the amount of $119,400,000, for the
benefit of the stockholders of Parent who purchased shares in Parents
initial public offering and any of their transferees and that Parent may
disburse monies from the Trust Account only (i) to such stockholders in the
event of the redemption of their shares or the liquidation of Parent or (ii)
to Parent after it consummates an initial Business Combination (as defined in
the Prospectus). Each of the EDandF Parties hereby agrees that it does not
have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in
the Trust Account (" _Trust Account Claim_ ") and hereby waives any Trust
Account Claim it may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of,
any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Parent and will not seek
recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever. This paragraph
will survive this Agreement and will not expire and will not be altered in
any way without the express written consent of Parent.

  



  

Section 7.14. _Collection of Receivables_. EDandF shall, and shall cause the
Transferred Companies to, by letter prepared by Parent or the Surviving LLCs
(the " _Letter_ ") and reasonably acceptable to EDandF, authorize, instruct and
direct that the account parties of all accounts, notes

  



        
   

  



  

and receivables (including insurance proceeds) included in the assets of the
Transferred Companies (such parties, the " _Seller Account Parties_ ") shall
make and deliver all payments relating thereto on or after the Closing to
such location, bank and account as Parent or the applicable Surviving LLC
shall specify.  If any of the Seller Account Parties remits payments on or
after the Closing to an EDandF Party, EDandF shall, and shall cause the
other EDandF Parties to, deliver all such payments to Parent or the Surviving
LLC or pay to Parent or the applicable Surviving LLC an amount equal to
such payments and Parent or the applicable Surviving LLC shall reimburse
EDandF for its reasonable expenses directly related thereto. If any Person
remits payments on or after the Closing to Parent or any Transferred Company
which are not due and payable to a Transferred Company, but are instead due
and payable to EDandF or a Subsidiary of EDandF that is not a Transferred
Company, Parent shall, and shall cause the Transferred Companies to, deliver
all such payments to EDandF or pay to EDandF an amount equal to such payments
and EDandF shall reimburse Parent or such Transferred Company for its
reasonable expenses directly related thereto.

  



  

Section 7.15. _Dividend_. Except as set forth in this _Section 7.15_, prior
to the Closing, Parent shall not declare, set aside or pay any dividends on
or make any other distributions (whether in cash, stock, equity securities or
property) in respect of any capital stock or split, combine or reclassify any
capital stock or issue or authorize the issuance of any other securities
in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for any capital stock.
Notwithstanding anything in the previous sentence to the contrary, Parent
shall use its best efforts, to the extent permitted under the DGCL and
Parents certificate of incorporation, to declare and pay a special dividend
of $1.00 per share to each holder of Parent Common Stock immediately
following the Closing.  Parent has obtained from Parent Founder a waiver of
such special dividend and EDandF agrees to waive its rights and shall cause
each other Stock Acquiror to waive its rights to receive such special
dividend when declared by the board of directors of Parent.

  



  

Section 7.16. _Financing_. Each party hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the condition set forth in _Section
8.1(f)_ to be satisfied.

  



  

Section 7.17. _Directors and Officers of Parent and the Surviving LLCs_.

cases of the preceding clauses (i) through (iv), at the time of the Closing.

  



         
 

  



  

(b) Subject to applicable Law, Parent shall take all necessary action to
nominate for election to serve as the directors of Parent effective
immediately following the Closing the following individuals (collectively,
the " _Proposed Initial Directors_ "):

  



  

(i) three individuals designated by EDandF (whom EDandF shall designate in
writing to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof);
and

  



  

(ii) the three individuals listed in _Section 7.17(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule; and

  



  

(iii) one individual, designated in writing to EDandF by Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof after reasonable consultation
with EDandF, who (w) has previously served as a director of a company the
shares of which are listed on a national securities exchange or market, (x)
is reasonably qualified to serve as a director of Parent, (y) would, upon

(z) is reasonably acceptable to EDandF.

nominate for election to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of Parent the
individual listed in _Section 7.17(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule under
the caption "Chief Executive Officer of Parent."

  



  

Section 7.18. _OTC Bulletin Board Listing_. Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to continue listing of the Parent Common
Stock on the OTCBB, _provided_ , _however_ , that if the lenders under
the Parent Credit Facility require that the Parent Common Stock be listed
for trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC or the NYSE Alternext US LLC,
Parent and EDandF shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
listing for trading of the Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market,
LLC or the NYSE Alternext US LLC. Subject to the foregoing proviso, if
continued listing is not secured by the Closing, the parties shall continue
to use their commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing to obtain such
listing.

  



  

Section 7.19. _Trust Account Disbursement_. The Trust Account shall be
disbursed to Parent immediately upon the Closing in an amount not less than
$138,000,000, less any payments and reserves contemplated hereby, including
as follows:

  



  

(a) Adequate reserves shall be made by Parent for payments to stockholders of
Parent electing to convert their shares of Parent common stock into cash as
provided in Parents Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

(b) To the extent permitted under the DGCL and Parents certificate of
incorporation, adequate reserves shall be made by Parent for payment of the
special dividend referred to in _Section 7.15_.

  



  

(c) All other liabilities of Parent and the Merger Subs due and owing or
incurred at or prior to the Closing Date shall be paid as and when due,
including all

  



        
   

  



  

Parent Tax liabilities and the payment at Closing of professional and other
fees and expenses related to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and adequate reserves shall be made against amounts distributed from the
Trust Account therefor.

  



  

Section 7.20. _SEC Reports_. Subject to EDandFs compliance with
its obligations under _Section 7.10_, Parent shall file all Parent
SEC Documents required to be filed by it from the date of this Agreement to
the Closing Date and shall use its best efforts to do so in a timely manner.
Parent shall cause such Parent SEC Documents (i) to be prepared in accordance
and comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of
the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and (ii) not, at
the time they are filed (and if amended or superseded by a filing prior
to the date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing and as so
amended or superseded), to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

Section 7.21. _Ownership and Acquisition of Parent Common Stock_.  No EDandF
Party nor any of its Affiliates owns beneficially or of record, and during
the period from the date hereof until the Closing, the EDandF Parties shall
not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, purchase or otherwise acquire
beneficial or record ownership of, any shares of Parent Common Stock, or any
securities convertible into, exchangeable for or carrying the right to
acquire, any shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

Section 7.22. _Denmark Newco_. Prior to the Closing, EDandF shall cause to be
organized a Danish private limited company (" _Denmark Newco_ "),
the outstanding capital stock of which will, immediately prior to the
Closing, be wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by EDandF. At or prior to the
Closing, EDandF shall cause Westway Terminals Danmark ApS to transfer and
assign to Denmark Newco all of the assets and liabilities described in
_Section 7.22_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Danish Asset Transfer_ ").
Denmark Newco shall upon its organization pursuant to this _Section 7.22_ be
a "Purchased Company" for all purposes hereunder. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, to the extent that any representation or warranty of
the EDandF Parties contained herein with respect to a Transferred Company
speaks as of the date of this Agreement or any other date prior to the date
of the Danish Asset Transfer, such representation or warranty shall,
with respect solely to Denmark Newco, be deemed to speak as of the date of,
and after giving effect to, the Danish Asset Transfer.

  



  

Section 7.23. _Audited Year-End Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) As soon as practicable, but in any event prior to December 10, 2008, EDandF
shall deliver to Parent the combined balance sheets of the Business as of
October 31, 2007 and 2006 and the combined statements of operations and cash
flows of the Business for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, each as audited and reported on by Ernst and Young LLP (collectively, the
" _Audited Year-End Financial Statements_ ").

  



  

(b) Upon delivery of the Audited Year-End Financial Statements, the EDandF
Parties shall be deemed to have represented and warranted to Parent and the
Merger Subs

  



        
   

  



  

that: (i) the Audited Year-End Financial Statements have been derived from
the books and records of the Transferred Companies; (ii) the Audited Year-End
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP except as
otherwise expressly stated therein; and (iii) each of the balance sheets in
the Audited Year-End Financial Statements fairly presents in all material
respects the consolidated financial condition of the Business as of its
respective date, and each statement of operations in the Audited Year-End
Financial Statements fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations of the Business for the period covered thereby. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the date
on which EDandF delivers the Audited Year-End Financial Statements to Parent
pursuant to clause (a) of this _Section 7.23_, (x) the EDandF Parties shall
not have any liability with respect to, or any indemnification obligation to
any Parent Indemnified Party for Losses arising out of or relating to, the
Unaudited Year-End Financial Statements, (y) the representations and
warranties contained in clause (a) of _Section 5.5_ and all of clause (c)
of  _Section 5.5_ except for the first sentence thereof shall be deemed to
have expired and (z) the term "Financial Information" shall be deemed for all
purposes of the Agreement to mean, collectively, the Interim Financials and
the Audited Year-End Financial Statements.

  



  

(c) In the event that the consolidated financial condition and results of
operations of the Business reflected in the balance sheet of the Business as
of October 31, 2007 and the combined statements of operations and cash flows
of the Business for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007 (in each case
contained in the Audited Year-End Financial Statements) are, in the
reasonable, good faith judgment of Parent, materially worse than the
consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Business
reflected in the balance sheet of the Business as of October 31, 2007 and the
combined statements of operations and cash flows of the Business for the
fiscal year ended October 31, 2007 (in each case contained in the Unaudited
Year-End Financial Statements) (an " _Audit Difference_ "), Parent may elect
to terminate the Agreement, if, and only if, Parent notifies EDandF in writing
of such election no later than seven days after delivery to Parent of the
Audited Financial Statements. If Parent fails timely to provide such notice,
the Audit Difference will be disregarded for all purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of determining whether the condition to Closing set
forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ (or any other condition to Closing set forth in
_Article VIII_) has been satisfied. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will an Audit Difference
constitute a Loss or otherwise give rise to any right of indemnification on
the part of any Parent Indemnified Party under _Section 10.2_ or otherwise.

(e) by Parent, if it and the Merger Subs are not in material breach of
their obligations under this Agreement and if (i) at any time any of
the representations and warranties of the EDandF Parties herein become untrue
or inaccurate such that _Section 8.2(a)_ would not be satisfied (treating
such time as if it were the Closing Date for purposes of this _Section
9.1(e)_); or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of any EDandF Party of
any of their covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that

(i) and (ii), such breach has not been cured within 30 days after written
notice to EDandF, if curable;

  



  

(f) by EDandF, if neither it nor any of the other EDandF Parties is

(g) by Parent in accordance with _Section 7.23(c)_.

7.13_, _Section 10.3_ and _ARTICLE XI_ will survive termination of this
Agreement and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for
any willful breach of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
liabilities hereunder (i) shall not include any consequential, special,
indirect or punitive damages (except to the extent any such consequential,
special, incidental, indirect or punitive damages are paid to a third party
in a third party claim), but (ii) may, notwithstanding clause (i), include
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, penalties and reasonable costs and
expenses attributable to diminution of value (including lost profits to the
extent that a court applying New York law would take lost profits into

time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of
any condition based on the accuracy of any representation, or warranty, or on
the performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreements, will
not affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on such

Section 10.2. _Indemnification_.

and Holdings agree to indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving LLCs,

Parties_ ") without duplication against and in respect of any and all Losses
of the Parent Indemnified Parties (including, after the Closing, the

Consideration up to the Stock Sale Consideration and as an indemnity for the
excess. Any payment to be made to any Indemnified Party under this Agreement
shall be made to an account or accounts

  



        
   

  



  

designated by such Indemnified Party not less than two Business Days prior to
such payment for one or more Indemnified Parties.

  



  

Section 10.3. _Method of Asserting Claims, etc_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 7.5_, all claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party hereunder shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in
this _Section 10.3_. An Indemnified Party entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving
a claim or demand made by, or an action, proceeding or investigation
instituted by, any Person (whether or not a party to this Agreement) (an "
_Indemnity Claim_ "), must notify the Indemnifying Party in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of the Indemnity Claim as promptly as practicable after
such Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnity Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Such written notice (the " _Claim
Notice_ ") shall (i) describe such Indemnity Claim in as much detail as is
reasonably practicable, including a reference to sections of this Agreement
which form the basis for such claim, and (ii) to the extent possible, set
forth the amount or the estimated amount thereof (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such claim and demand) along with copies of
all written evidence thereof.

  



  

(b) If an Indemnity Claim is made against an Indemnified Party by a third
party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") (except with respect to a Tax Proceeding,
which shall be exclusively governed by _Section 7.5_), such Indemnified
Party shall promptly, but in no event more than 30 days following such
Indemnified Partys receipt of such Third Party Claim, deliver a Claim Notice
to the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
failure to provide such notice within the time period required shall not
affect the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party was materially prejudiced thereby. The
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from the personal delivery or mailing
of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party
whether or not it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third
Party Claim. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim described in a Claim Notice that (i) seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief as a primary remedy, (ii) is a criminal claim, or
(iii) primarily relates to a claim or demand of, or a dispute with, a
material customer of the Business. All costs and expenses incurred by
the Indemnifying Party in defending such claim or demand shall be a liability
of, and shall be paid by, the Indemnifying Party.  In the event that the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period
that it desires to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, except as
herein provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to do so by
appropriate proceedings. If the Indemnifying Party has the right to and
elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and
competence; shall take all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim; and shall diligently pursue the
resolution of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party desires
to participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement, it may do
so at its sole cost and expense,

  



        
   

  



  

it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense;
_provided_ , _however_ , __ that the Indemnifying Party shall pay
all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of one outside counsel in connection
with such participation (i) if it requests the Indemnified Party to
participate or (ii) if in the reasonable written opinion of outside counsel
to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make
joint representation of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party impermissible under applicable standards of professional conduct. If
the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim,
all of the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Subject to attorney-client privilege, such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys reasonable
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
which are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder; _provided,_ _however_ , that
any out-of-pocket cost incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
such copying or employee availability shall be at the Indemnifying Partys
expense. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may only settle or compromise a Third Party
Claim with the Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party may settle or compromise such a Third Party Claim without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party if such settlement or compromise
(x) provides solely for the payment of money by the Indemnifying Party and
includes a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from
all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim and (y) does not subject
the Indemnified Party to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy. If
the Indemnifying Party does not defend the Indemnified Party against a Third
Party Claim for which the Indemnifying Party has an indemnification
obligation hereunder, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely
notice as provided above or otherwise, then the amount of any such Third
Party Claim, or, if the same be contested by the Indemnified Party, then that
portion thereof as to which such defense is unsuccessful shall be the
liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, subject to the limitations set
forth in this _ARTICLE X_ , _provided_  that whether or not the Indemnifying
Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim, or consent to the
entry of any judgment, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party.

  



  

Section 10.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Except with respect to breaches of the EDandF Fundamental Representations
and of the representations and warranties in _Section 5.17_ (Taxes),
EDandF and Holdings shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless the

_Section 10.2(a)_ until the aggregate amount of all such Losses with respect
to which a Claim Notice was delivered in accordance with _Section 10.3_
exceeds $7,000,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which event EDandF and
Holdings shall be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for
all Losses in excess of the Basket Amount.

  



         
 

  



  

(b) Except with respect to breaches of the EDandF Fundamental Representations

indemnify or hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties for Losses under
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ in the aggregate in excess of $30,000,000 (the " _Cap_
").

  



  

(c) EDandF and Holdings shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless the
Parent Indemnified Parties for any Losses arising or resulting from any
breach of _Section 5.28_ (Proxy Statement) except to the extent such Losses

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither EDandF
nor Holdings shall have any liability under _Section 10.2(a)_ for any
individual item or series of related items where the Loss relating thereto is
less than $75,000 and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of
_Section 10.4(a)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, solely for purposes of
determining whether the amount of a Loss for a Tax indemnifiable under
Section 10.2(a)(iii) is less than $75,000, no offset or reduction for any
other Tax included in the determination of Merger Closing Date Net
Indebtedness or Stock Sale Closing Date Net Indebtedness shall be taken into
consideration.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except with
respect to Losses resulting or arising from (i) EDandF Indemnifiable Taxes,
(ii) breaches of the EDandF Fundamental Representations or the representations
and warranties in _Section 5.17_ (Taxes) and (iii) the Designated Pre-
Closing Activities, the aggregate liability of EDandF and Holdings for Losses
under _Section 10.2(a)_ shall not in any event exceed the Adjusted Stock
Sale Purchase Price.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither EDandF
nor Holdings shall have any obligation to indemnify or hold harmless any
Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses resulting or arising from
any breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Section
5.15_ (Environmental Matters), any Additional Indemnification Matter or any
claim relating to any environmental matters, Environmental Liabilities,
Hazardous Substances or Environmental Laws to the extent any such Loss or
claim relates to, arises out of or is triggered by any condition that is
discovered or identified as a result of any environmental investigation,
testing or sampling conducted by or on behalf of Parent after the Closing
other than any such investigation, testing or sampling that is (i) required
by a Governmental Authority (except to the extent such requirement results
from a condition caused by the Parent after the Closing or results from
the solicitation or encouragement of Parent or its Affiliates after the
Closing) or (ii) required by a third party purchaser in connection with the
sale of a terminal facility.

  



  

(g) For purposes of this _ARTICLE X_ , the determination of (i) whether
there has been a breach of a representation or warranty and (ii)
Losses resulting or arising from such breach shall be made without regard to
any materiality qualification (including any reference to Business Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect), except for such
qualifications contained in the representations and warranties set forth in

  



        
   

  



  

 _Sections 5.5(c)_ , _Section 5.5(e)_, the first sentence of _Section 5.6_,
and _Sections 5.11(a)_ , _5.11(c)_ ,  _5.11(f)_ , _5.12(g)_ and _5.28_.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a Parent
Indemnified Partys right to commence any claim under clauses _(iv)_ and
_(v)_ of _Section 10.2(a)_ shall terminate on the date that is the second
anniversary of the date of this Agreement, and neither EDandF nor Holdings
shall have any obligation to indemnify or hold harmless any
Parent Indemnified Party under clauses _(iv)_ and _(v)_ of _Section
10.2(a)_ unless and except to the extent that a bona fide Claim Notice
specifically relating thereto is delivered prior to such date in accordance
with _Section 10.3(a)_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither EDandF
nor Holdings shall have any obligation to indemnify or hold harmless any
Parent Indemnified Party under _Section 10.2(a)(v)_ to the extent the claim
for indemnification relates to any environmental matters,
Environmental Liabilities, Hazardous Substances or Environmental Laws.

  



  

Section 10.5. _Losses Net of Insurance, etc._ The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided shall be net of (i) any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party (which shall include a party receiving
payment) pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification or other
agreement with any third party, (ii) any insurance proceeds or other cash
receipts or sources of reimbursement actually received as an offset against
such Loss (net of any costs incurred to recover such amounts, proceeds or
receipts, such as deductibles, all handling and collection charges by
any claims handler appointed by EDandF and Holdings and any increased
premiums, including retroactive premium increases, associated with such
recovery or the Tax actually incurred in connection with such amounts,
proceeds or receipts), (iii) the value of any Tax benefit actually realized
by the Indemnified Party as a result of such Loss within five years following
the incurrence of any such Loss; it being understood that if the Indemnified
Party receives any Tax benefit in respect of any Loss after the Indemnified
Party has been indemnified therefor by an Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly remit in cash the amount of such Tax benefit to such
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall be required
to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all amounts described in
clauses (i)  (iii) of this _Section 10.5_, and (iv) any amounts set forth,
provided for or reserved against in the Merger Closing Balance Sheet, the
Stock Sale Closing Balance Sheet or the Financial Information. If under
the terms of this Agreement one party is liable to indemnify or reimburse
another party the payment shall, if required by law, include an amount equal
to any VAT thereon not otherwise recoverable by the other party, subject to
that other party using all commercially reasonable efforts to recover such
amount of VAT as may be practicable. For the avoidance of doubt, all
indemnification payments due under this _ARTICLE X_ shall be made in the
currency in which the loss was incurred (except as specified below). For
purposes of the Basket, the Cap and other dollar denominated limitations on
indemnification, foreign currencies shall be converted into U.S. dollars
using the exchange rate at which such foreign currencies are offered on the
date on which an indemnification payment is made for U.S. dollars as reported
in The Wall Street Journal on the day following the day on which payment is
made.

  



  

Section 10.6. _Sole Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that after the Closing, the indemnities provided in _Section 10.2_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the

  



        
   

  



  

parties at law or in equity for any breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or other claim arising out of this Agreement,
_provided_ that nothing contained herein shall limit any partys remedies in
respect of any intentional misrepresentation or omission by any other party.

  



  

Section 10.7. _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable
steps to mitigate their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Loss that is indemnifiable hereunder.

  



  

Section 10.8. _No Set-Off_. Neither Parent nor EDandF or any of
their Affiliates shall have any right to set-off any Losses against any
payments, or deduct from, holdback or otherwise reduce in any manner, any
payments to be made by any of them pursuant to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, or otherwise.

  



  

Section 10.9. _Provisions in Financial Information_. No EDandF Party shall
have any liability under this Agreement in respect of any Indemnity Claim if
and to the extent that proper allowance, provision or reserve is made in the
Financial Information for the matter or matters giving rise to the Indemnity
Claim.

(c) of this _Section 11.1_.

  



  

Section 11.2. _Exhibits and Schedules_. All exhibits and schedules attached
hereto are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set
forth in full herein.  Any matter disclosed in any section of the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in all other sections of the
Disclosure Schedule where it is reasonably apparent on its face that the
matters so disclosed are applicable to such other sections.  Disclosure of
any item in a section of the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an
admission that such item represents a material item, fact, exception of fact,
event or circumstance or that occurrence or non-occurrence of any change or
effect related to such item would result in a Business Material Adverse
Effect, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the
ability of any party to consummate any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

Section 11.3. _Time of the Essence; Computation of Time_. Time is of
the essence for each and every provision of this Agreement. Whenever the last
day for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder
shall fall upon a day that is not a Business Day, the party having such
privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on the
next succeeding day which is a regular Business Day.

  



  

Section 11.4. _Expenses_. Regardless of whether the transactions provided for
in this Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise provided herein, each
party hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ ,

  



        
   

  



  

 _however_ , that, if the Closing is consummated, all accountants fees and
expenses incurred by any party hereto in connection with (a) the audit of any
financial statements relating to the Business or any Transferred Company or
(b) the preparation, filing, amendment and distribution of the Proxy
Statement shall be paid by Parent. Any transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid, or caused to be paid 50% by EDandF and 50% by
Parent, and, subject to _Section 7.5(g)_, all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such transfer Taxes, fees and charges
shall be filed by the party required by Law to file them.

  



  

Section 11.5. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the rights and duties
of the parties hereto hereunder will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or
rules are not mandatorily applicable by statute and would require or permit
the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction. The parties irrevocably
and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or, if such court does
not have jurisdiction, the New York State Supreme Court in the Borough of
Manhattan, in any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement.  The
parties irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of the interpretation
and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or with respect to any such action or
proceeding, will be heard and determined in such a New York federal or State
court, and that such jurisdiction of such courts with respect thereto will be
exclusive, except solely to the extent that all such courts lawfully decline
to exercise such jurisdiction.  Each party hereby waives, and agrees not to
assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation
or enforcement hereof or of any such document or in respect of any such
transaction, that it is not subject to such jurisdiction. Each party
hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document or in respect of any such
transaction, that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is
not maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced
in or by such courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of
any such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers
in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section 11.1_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law, will be
valid and sufficient service thereof.

  



  

Section 11.6. _Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Rights_.
Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not, without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto, be assigned by operation
of Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and void.
 Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
successors, permitted assigns and legal representatives.  This Agreement
shall be for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their
respective heirs, successors, permitted assigns and legal representatives and
is not intended, nor shall be construed, to give any Person, other than the
parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors, assigns and legal
representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim hereunder.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 11.7. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts for the convenience of the parties hereto, each of which
shall be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and
the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
to this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a mutually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.8. _Titles and Headings_. The titles, captions and table of
contents in this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not in
any way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or
otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.9. _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise contemplated herein,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (a) constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof (other
than the Confidentiality Agreement); and (b) other than parties to the
Ancillary Agreements are not intended to confer upon any other Persons any
rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder. The parties acknowledge that
each of the parties hereto participated in the drafting of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements and agree that any rule of Law or any legal decision
that may or would require interpretation of any alleged ambiguities in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements against the party that drafted it has
no application and is expressly waived. In the event of a conflict or
inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement (including the
representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions hereof)
and the terms of any other documents delivered or required to be delivered in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement
shall supersede such conflicting or inconsistent terms in such other
documents and the terms of this Agreement shall define the rights and
obligations of the parties and their respective officers, directors,
employees, stockholders and Affiliates with respect to the subject matter of
such conflict or inconsistency.

  



  

Section 11.10. _Severability_. The invalidity of any portion hereof shall not
affect the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions hereof. If it
is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to permit
enforcement of such restriction to its fullest extent, such restriction shall
be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by Law.

  



  

Section 11.11. _No Strict Construction_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that this Agreement has been prepared jointly by the parties
hereto, and is not to be strictly construed against either party.  As a
consequence, the parties do not intend that the presumptions of any Laws or
rules relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any
particular clause should be applied to this Agreement and therefore waive
their effects.

  



  

Section 11.12. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any court
specified in _Section 11.5_, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 11.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto waives any
right it may have to trial by jury in respect of any litigation based on,
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or any course of
conduct, course of dealing, verbal or written statement or action of any
party hereto.

  



  

Section 11.14. _Failure or Indulgence not Waiver_. No failure or delay
on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
shall impair such right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall
any single or parties exercise of any such right preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or any other right. All rights and remedies
existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any
rights or remedies otherwise available.

  



  

Section 11.15. _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, by action taken by EDandF, Holdings, Westway Terminal,
Westway Feed, Parent and the Merger Subs, and after the Closing by EDandF,
Holdings, Parent and the Surviving LLCs. This Agreement (including the
provisions of this _Section 11.15_) may not be amended or modified except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties required
pursuant to the preceding sentence.
