**AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 

 

**AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER**   (the " _Agreement_ "),  dated  as of
April 1, 2007, by and among Xerox Corporation, a New York corporation 
(the " _Parent_ "),  RG  Acquisition I Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of  the  Parent (the " _Purchaser_ "),  and 
Global Imaging Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Seller_ ").

 

 

**_Recitals_**

 

 

A. The  boards of directors of each of the Purchaser, the Seller and the
Parent have  approved the acquisition of the Seller by the Parent on the
terms and conditions  set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

B. Pursuant  to this Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein,  the  Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer (the "
_Offer_ ")  to  purchase all the Seller's common stock, par value $0.01 per
share (" _Seller  Common Stock_ ")  at a  price per share of $29.00 net to
the selling stockholders in cash, without  interest (such amount or any
greater amount per share paid pursuant to the  Offer  being hereafter
referred to as the " _Offer  Price_ ").

 

 

C. The  board  of directors of the Seller has (A) by unanimous vote of the
directors (i)  determined that this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger (as
defined below)  are  advisable, and in the best interest of the Seller and
its stockholders, (ii)  approved the Offer and the merger of the Purchaser
with and into the Seller,  with the Seller as the surviving corporation (the
" _Merger_ " and,  with the Offer and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, the " _Transaction_ ")  in  accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ")  and  (iii) approved this
Agreement and (B) is recommending that the Seller's  stockholders accept the
Offer, tender their shares of Seller Common Stock into  the Offer, approve
the Merger and adopt this Agreement.

 

 

D. The  parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in  connection with the Transaction and to prescribe certain
conditions to the  Transaction.

 

 

**_Agreement_**

 

 

In  consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants,
representations,  warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending
to be legally bound  hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  I  -  THE  OFFER**

 

 

** 1.1  ** _**The  Offer.**_

 

 

(a) Provided  that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with  _Article  IX_  hereof  and none of the events set forth
in _Annex  I_   hereto  (the " _Tender  Offer Conditions_ ")  shall 
have occurred and be continuing, on April 4, 2007 (or such other day as the 
parties shall agree in writing), the Parent shall cause the Purchaser (and 
the  Seller shall cooperate with the Parent and the Purchaser) to commence
(within  the meaning of Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act) an offer to purchase
all  outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock at the Offer Price and shall
use  its  reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the
terms and  conditions hereof and thereof. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this  Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver of the Tender Offer
Conditions,  the  Purchaser shall, and the Parent shall cause it to,
promptly after the expiration  of the Offer, accept for payment, and pay for
(after giving effect to any  required withholding Tax), all shares of Seller
Common Stock validly tendered  pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn (the
time and date of acceptance for  payment, the " _Acceptance  Date_ "). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
waive, in  whole or in part, any Tender Offer Condition or modify the terms
of the Offer;  _provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written
consent of the  Seller, the Purchaser shall not decrease the Offer Price or
change the form  of  consideration payable in the Offer, waive or amend the
Minimum Condition (as  defined in _Annex I_ hereto), decrease the number of
shares of Seller  Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose
additional conditions  to the Offer or amend any other term of the Offer in
any manner adverse to  the  holders of shares of Seller Common Stock. The
Offer shall remain open until  12:00 midnight, New York time, on the date
that is twenty-five (25) Business  Days after the commencement (determined
pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under  the  Exchange Act) of the Offer (the "
_Expiration Date_ "), unless the Purchaser  shall have extended the period of
time for which the Offer is open pursuant  to,  and in accordance with, the
succeeding sentence or as may be required by  applicable Laws or
interpretations or positions of the Securities and Exchange  Commission or
its staff (the " _SEC_ "), in which event the term " _Expiration Date_ "
shall mean the latest time and date as the Offer, as so  extended, may
expire; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser may,  in its sole
discretion, provide a subsequent offering period after the  Expiration Date,
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. If  on  any then
scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Tender Offer Conditions is not 
satisfied or waived by the Purchaser, the Purchaser may extend the Offer
from  time to time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, on such Expiration Date, 
(i) if the waiting period under the HSR Act or under any applicable foreign 
statutes or regulations applicable to the Offer or the Merger shall have not 
expired or been terminated, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time 
to  time until the expiration or termination under the HSR Act or any other
material  applicable foreign statutes or regulations or (ii) if any of the
Tender Offer  Conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) or (b) of _Annex I_
hereto  shall have occurred and be continuing, the Purchaser shall extend the
Offer  from  time to time in consecutive increments of up to five (5)
Business Days each  until the time such condition or conditions shall no
longer exist or any of  the  matters described in such paragraphs (a) or (b)
shall have become final and  non-appealable; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ that the  Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date  (defined in _Section 9.1(b)_ below). Nothing
contained in this  paragraph shall affect any termination rights in _Article
IX_ _._   Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the
satisfaction of  all  the Tender Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Date,
the Purchaser will accept  for payment and pay for all shares of Seller
Common Stock validly tendered  and  not validly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer promptly after the Expiration Date  of the Offer.

(c) On  the  date of commencement of the Offer, the Parent and the Purchaser
shall (i)  file  or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement
on Schedule  TO (together with all  amendments and supplements thereto, the
" _Schedule  TO_ ")  with  respect to the Offer which shall contain the
offer to purchase and related  letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement and other ancillary documents  and instruments required thereby
pursuant to which the Offer will be made  (collectively with any supplements
or amendments thereto, the " _Offer  Documents_ ")  and  (ii) cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Seller  Common  Stock. The
Seller and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity  to  review
and comment on the Offer Documents prior to their filing with the  SEC,  and
the Parent and the Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith 
consideration to any comments made by Seller and their counsel. The Parent 
and  the Purchaser agree to provide the Seller with (i) any comments or
other  communications, whether written or oral, that may be received from
the  SEC or  its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt thereof  and  prior to responding thereto and (ii) a reasonable
opportunity to provide  comments on that response (to which reasonable and
good faith consideration  shall be given). If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information  relating to the Offer, the Merger, the
Seller, the Parent, the Purchaser  or any  of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered  by  the Seller or the Purchaser
which should be set forth in an amendment or  supplement to the Offer
Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not  contain  any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact  required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements  therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not  misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify  the  other
party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such 
information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders 
of  the Seller, as and to the extent required by applicable Law or any
applicable  rule or regulation of any stock exchange. The Seller shall
furnish to the  Parent  and the Purchaser all information concerning the
Seller required by the  Exchange  Act to be set forth in the Offer
Documents.

 

 

 

 

(d) The  Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the Purchaser on a
timely basis  the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Seller Common
Stock that the  Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer
and shall cause  the Purchaser to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

 

(e) The  Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration  otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of
shares of Seller Common  Stock such amounts as the Purchaser is required to
deduct and withhold with  respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state,  local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid  over to the appropriate Taxing
authority by the Purchaser, such withheld amounts  shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to  the  holder of the shares
of Seller Common Stock in respect of which such deduction  and withholding
was made by the Purchaser.

 

 

 

 

 

** 1.2  ** **_Seller  Actions_.**

 

 

 

(a) The  Seller shall, after affording the Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review  and  comment thereon, file with the SEC and mail to the holders of
shares of  Seller  Common Stock, as promptly as practicable on the date of
the filing by the  Parent  and the Purchaser of the Offer Documents, a
Solicitation/Recommendation  Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments  or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule  14D-9_ ")  reflecting
the

recommendation  of the Seller board of directors that holders of shares of
Seller Common Stock  tender their shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer and shall  disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required by Rule 14d-9
promulgated under  the  Exchange Act. The Schedule 14D-9 will set  forth,
and the Seller hereby represents, that the Seller board of directors,  at  a
meeting duly called and held at which a quorum was present throughout, has 
unanimously (i) determined and declared that this Agreement, the 
Transaction, and each of the Offer and the Merger, is advisable and in the 
best  interests of the Seller and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Offer
and  this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, (iii) recommended acceptance
of  the Offer, tender of the shares of Seller Common Stock into the Offer
and  adoption of this Agreement by the Seller Stockholders if such adoption
is  required by applicable Laws (together with the declarations in clause
(i),  the " _Seller  Recommendations_ "),  and  (iv) taken all other
action necessary to render Section 203 of the DGCL  inapplicable to each of
the Offer and the Merger; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Seller
Recommendations may be withdrawn, modified or amended only prior  to  the
acceptance for payment of shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to the 
Offer and in any case only to the extent permitted by _Section 7.2_.  The 
Seller hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Seller 
Recommendations.  If at  any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information relating to the Offer,  the  Merger, the Seller, the Parent, the
Purchaser or any of their respective  Affiliates, directors or officers,
should be discovered by the Seller or the  Purchaser which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the  Schedule 14D-9, so that the
Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to  be  stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light  of  the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, the party which  discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party, and an  appropriate

promptly upon the payment by the Purchaser of such number of shares of
Seller  Common Stock as represents at least a majority of the then-
outstanding shares  of  Seller Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and from
time to time thereafter,  the  Parent shall be entitled to designate such
number of directors, rounded up  to  the next whole number, on the Seller
board of directors as is equal to the  product of (x) the total number of
directors on the Seller board of directors  (determined after giving effect

Seller Common Stock beneficially owned by the Purchaser  or  any of its
Affiliates bears to the total number of shares of Seller Common  Stock  then
outstanding, and the Seller shall, upon request of the Parent, promptly  take
all actions necessary to cause the Parent's designees to be so elected or 
appointed (including, if necessary, seeking the resignations of one or more 
existing directors or increasing the size of the Seller board of directors) 
in  compliance with applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the
Parent shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors 
on the Seller board of directors (as long as the Parent and its Affiliates

of  the Seller);  _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  that  prior to the Effective
Time, the Seller board of directors shall always have  at  least two members
who are not officers, directors, employees or designees of  the  Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates (" _Purchaser  Insiders_ ").  If  the number of
directors who are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced below two  prior to the
Effective Time, the remaining director who is not a Purchaser  Insider shall
be entitled to designate a Person to fill such vacancy who is  not  a
Purchaser Insider and who shall be a director not deemed to be a Purchaser 
Insider for all purposes of this Agreement.

information required by such Section and Rule, as promptly as  practicable
following the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 and shall include in  the 
Information Statement such information with respect to the Seller and its 
officers and directors as is required under such Section and Rule in order 
to  fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.3_.  The  Parent will
supply to the Seller any information with respect to itself and  its 
officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section and  Rule.

there shall only be one director then  in  office who is not a Purchaser
Insider) and such authorization shall constitute  the authorization of the
Seller board of directors and no other action  on the  part of the Seller,
including any action by any other director of the Seller,  shall be required
to authorize.

(a) The  Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "
_Top-Up  Option_ "),  exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth
in this _Section 1.4_,  to  purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer
Price paid in the Offer up  to  that number of newly issued shares of Seller
Common Stock (the " _Top-Up  Shares_ ")  equal  to the lowest number of
shares of Seller Common Stock that, when added to the  number of shares of
Seller Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by the  Parent or the
Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall  constitute one
share more than 90% of the shares of Seller Common Stock  outstanding
immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (determined  on a "fully
diluted basis" (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative 
securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting
schedule  or other terms and conditions thereof)); _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that  (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of
shares of  Seller Common Stock in excess of the shares of Seller Common Stock
authorized  and unissued at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option and
(ii) the  Top-Up Option may not be exercised unless, following the time of
acceptance  by  the Purchaser of shares of Seller Common Stock tendered in
the Offer or after  a  subsequent offering period, eighty-five percent (85%)
or more of the shares  of  Seller Common Stock shall be directly or
indirectly owned by the Parent or  the  Purchaser. The Top-Up Option shall
be exercisable once at any time following  the  Acceptance Date and prior to
the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time  and  (b) the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

 

(b) The  parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up  Shares comply with all applicable Law, including compliance with
an applicable  exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act.  If  the Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, the
Purchaser shall give  the  Seller one Business Day prior written notice,
specifying (i) the number of  shares of Seller Common Stock directly or
indirectly owned by the Parent at  the  time of such notice and (ii) a place
and a time for the closing of such  purchase. The Seller shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such  notice, deliver written notice to the
Purchaser specifying, based on the  information provided by the Purchaser in
its notice, the number of Top-Up  Shares. At the closing of the purchase of
Top-Up Shares, the purchase price  owed  by the Purchaser to the Seller
therefor shall be paid to the Seller (i) in  cash, by wire transfer or
cashier's check or (ii) by issuance by the  Purchaser to the Seller of a
promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory  to  the Seller.

**ARTICLE  III-  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE SELLER CAPITAL STOCK; 
EXCHANGE OF  SHARES**

by virtue of the Merger and  without any action on the part of the holder of
any shares of the capital stock  of the Seller or capital stock of the
Purchaser:

 

 

(a) _Capital  Stock of the Purchaser_.  Each  share of the common stock of

** 3.2  ** **_Seller  Stock-Based Awards_.** **   **(a)   As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Seller board  of 
directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the
Seller  Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
as may  be  required to effect the following:

 

 

(i) adjust  the terms of each outstanding Seller Stock Option, whether vested
or unvested,  as necessary to provide that such Seller Stock Option will
become fully  exercisable and may be exercised before the Effective Time at
such applicable  time or times as specified in the relevant Seller Stock
Plan, and, at the  Effective Time, each Seller Stock Option outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be canceled and the holder
thereof shall then become  entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the
rights of such holder with  respect thereto, as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time, a single  lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of Seller  Common Stock for which such Seller Stock
Option shall not theretofore have  been  exercised and (B) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the  exercise price per share of such
Seller Stock Option;

 

 

(ii) adjust  the terms of all outstanding Seller Restricted Shares as
necessary to provide  that, as of the Effective Time, each Seller Restricted
Share outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated in
accordance with  _Section 3.1(c)(ii)_;  and

 

 

(iii) make  such  other changes to the Seller Stock Plans as the Seller and
the Parent may agree  are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.

 

 

(b) All  amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_  shall be  subject to
any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest  as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) Prior  to  the Closing Date, the Seller shall ensure that following the
Effective Time  no  holder of a Seller Stock Option or Seller Restricted
Share (or former holder  of  a Seller Stock Option or Seller Restricted
Share) or any current or former  participant in any Seller Stock Plan, Seller
Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit  Agreement shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any capital stock of the  Seller, the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries or any other equity  interest therein (including "phantom" stock
or stock appreciation  rights).

 

 

 

** 3.3  ** **_Exchange  of Certificates_.** **** The  procedures for
exchanging outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock for the  Merger
Consideration are as follows:

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.   Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall (i)
designate, or cause to  be  designated, a bank or trust company that is
reasonably acceptable to the  Seller (the  " _Paying  Agent_ ")  and 
(ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably 
acceptable to the Seller, with such Paying Agent to act as agent for the 
payment  or exchange in accordance with this _Article III_  of the  Merger
Consideration (such cash being referred to as the " _Exchange  Fund_ ").  On
or  before the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit with the Paying
Agent  the  Exchange Fund for the benefit of the holders of Seller Common
Stock. The  Paying  Agent shall make payments of the Merger Consideration
out of the Exchange  Fund  in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for  any  unrelated other purpose.

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedures_.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of  a  certificate or certificates or evidence
of shares held in book-entry form which  immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Seller  Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ")  whose  shares were converted pursuant to _Section
3.1(c)_  into the  right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal (which  shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to  the  Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying  Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as the Parent  may  reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of  the Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of  a  Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or  agents as may be appointed by
the Parent, together with such letter of  transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be  required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled  to receive in exchange therefor
cash equal to the Merger Consideration payable  in respect of the shares of
Seller Common Stock previously represented by such  Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.  In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Seller Common Stock which is not  registered in the
transfer records of the Seller, payment may be made to a  Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is  registered, if
such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied  by  all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and  by 
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until 
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_,  each  Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent  only the right
to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No  interest shall
be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any  Certificate.

 

 

(c) _No  Further Ownership Rights in Seller Stock_.  The  Merger
Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates  in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered 
(and  paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Seller  Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further  registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving  Corporation of the shares of Seller Common Stock which were
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time,  Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent  for  any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this  _Article III_.

 

 

(d) _Termination  of Exchange Fund_.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the  holders of Seller Common Stock nine
months after the Effective Time shall be  delivered to the Parent, upon
demand, and any holder of Seller Common Stock  who  has not previously
complied with this _Section 3.3_  shall,  subject to _Section 3.3(e)_, 
thereafter look  only  to the Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger
Consideration.

  (e) _No  Liability_.  To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of
the Parent, the  Purchaser, the Seller, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall  be  liable to any holder of shares of Seller Common
Stock delivered to a public  official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar  law.  If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to two years after  the  Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any Merger  Consideration would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any  Governmental Authority), any such
Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall,  to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving  Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously  entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) _Investment  of Exchange Fund_.  The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as  directed by the Surviving Corporation. Any
net profit resulting from, or  interest or income produced by, such
investments, shall be payable to the  Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(g) _Withholding  Rights_.  Each of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall  be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable  pursuant to this Agreement (including any
payments made in respect of the  Dissenting Shares) to any holder of shares
of Seller Common Stock, such amounts  as it reasonably determines that it is
required to deduct and withhold with  respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable  provision of Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving  Corporation, the Parent or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld  amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been  paid  to the holder of the
shares of Seller Common Stock in respect of which such  deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, the Parent  or  the
Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 

 

(h) _Lost  Certificates_.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the  making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate  to  be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by the Surviving Corporation,  the  posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving  Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against  it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange  for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration  deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

 

** 3.4  ** **_Appraisal  Rights_**.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares
of Seller Common Stock  that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and  that  are held by Seller Stockholders who, in
accordance with Section 262 of the  DGCL (the " _Appraisal  Rights
Provisions_ ")  (i)  have not voted in favor of adopting and approving this
Agreement, (ii) shall  have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
shares, and (iii) have  not  effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to
perfect their rights to appraisal  (collectively, the " _Dissenting  Shares_
"),  will  not be converted as described in _Section 3.1_,  but at  the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the  part 
of the holder thereof, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall 
represent the right to receive only those rights provided  under the
Appraisal Rights Provisions; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  all shares of
Seller Common Stock held by Seller Stockholders who shall have  failed to
perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights  to
appraisal of such shares of Seller Common Stock under the Appraisal Rights 
Provisions shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled and to have been 
converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger 
Consideration relating thereto, without interest, in the manner provided

its consolidated  subsidiaries, that is required to be disclosed by the
Seller in the reports  it  files under the Exchange Act is made known to its
principal executive  officer  and principal financial officer or other
appropriate members of management  as  appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure;  (ii)  designed and maintained a system of
internal control over financial reporting  (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and

regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in  accordance  with GAAP,
including reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are executed  in 
accordance with management's general or specific authorizations and recorded
as  necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity

applicable Laws,  disclosed  in such report or in any amendment thereto any
change in the Seller's internal  control over financial reporting that

affect the Seller's ability to record,  process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud,  whether  or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a  significant role in the
Seller's internal control over financial reporting. To  the knowledge of the

has previously made available to the Parent complete and accurate  copies 
of each Contract of the type described in this _Section 5.15_  (collectively
referred to herein as the " _Seller  Contracts_ ").  All  of the Seller
Contracts are valid and in full force and effect, except  to the  extent
they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or if  the 
failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, 
would  not reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.
Neither  the  Seller nor any of its subsidiaries has, and to the knowledge
of the Seller,  none  of the other parties thereto have, violated any
provision of, or committed  or  failed to perform any act, and no event or
condition exists, which with  or  without notice, lapse of time or both
would constitute a default under  the  provisions of, any Seller Contract,
except in each case for those violations  and  defaults which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably  be  expected to result in a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Seller  nor  any of its
subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Seller, no other party  thereto, is
in material default under any Acquisition Agreement or any  Major  Supplier
Contract. The Seller has made available all agreements or instruments 
related or ancillary to each Acquisition Agreement. During each of the 
three  most recently completed fiscal years of the Seller, no Person (taken
together  with its Affiliates) accounted for more than 3% of the consolidated
revenues  of  the Seller. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the
Seller nor any  of its  subsidiaries has received notice from any Major
Supplier of an intent to  terminate or modify its relationship with the
Seller and its subsidiaries  in a  way which, individually or in the
aggregate, is or would reasonably be  expected  to be material in relation
of the Seller and its subsidiaries, taken as  a  whole.

Representatives may furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic  information

unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if and only to the extent that (i) the 
Acceptance Date has not occurred, (ii) the board of directors of the Seller 
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor,

such Person  that  contains confidentiality and other provisions that are
substantially similar  to  and no less favorable to Seller than the
Confidentiality Agreement dated  as of  December 7, 2006 by and between the
Parent and Seller (the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_ ")  and  (iv) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from the breach of this  _Section 
7.2_;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Seller shall promptly provide the

(e) Notwithstanding  _Section  7.2(d)_ ,  at any  time prior to the
purchase of any share of Seller Common Stock into the Offer,  the board of
directors of the Seller may make an Adverse Recommendation Change  if the
board of directors of the Seller determines in good faith after  consultation
with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action  would  be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to the Seller or its 
Stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  (I)
such action may only be taken at a time that is after the fourth  (4th)
Business Day following the Parent's receipt of written notice from  the
Seller that the board of directors of the Seller will take such action 
(which notice will specify the material terms of any applicable Acquisition 
Proposal) (such notice, an " _Adverse  Recommendation Change Notice_ ") 
and  (II) at the end  of  such period, the board of directors of the Seller
determines in good faith,  after taking into account all amendments or
revisions irrevocably committed  to  by the Parent and after consultation
with its financial advisors, that such  Acquisition Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal relative to the Transaction,  as  supplemented by any
Counterproposal (an " _Adverse  Recommendation Change Determination_ ")  (it
is  agreed that if the third party making the Acquisition Proposal referred
to  in  this sentence modifies a material term of its proposal, the four (4)
Business  Day period referred to in this sentence shall recommence). During
any such  four  (4) Business Day period, the Parent shall be entitled to
deliver to the Seller  a  counterproposal to such Acquisition Proposal (a "
_Counterproposal_ ")  and  the Seller shall in good faith negotiate such
Counterproposal with the Parent.  If an Adverse Recommendation Change
Determination is not made at the end  of such  four (4) Business Day period,
the Adverse Recommendation Change Notice shall  be  deemed withdrawn. If the
board of directors of the Seller makes an Adverse  Recommendation Change in
favor of a Superior Proposal at the end of the four  (4)  Business Day
period referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7.2(e),  the parties
hereby agree that, subject to compliance with this  Section 7.2(e) and in
order to enable such board of directors to be  sufficiently comfortable that
the Superior Proposal resulting in such Adverse  Recommendation Change will
remain available to the Seller when and if this  Agreement is terminated, the
Seller may enter into a binding agreement with  the  Person making such
Superior Proposal, which agreement (x) may provide that  such Person is
obligated, on behalf of the Seller, to make the payment required  to be made
by the Seller pursuant to the relevant provisions of Section 9.2(b)  of this
Agreement upon the termination of this Agreement and (y) may attach  as an
exhibit thereto a fully negotiated and executed agreement and plan  of 
merger (a " _Conditional  Merger Agreement_ ")  relating to such Superior
Proposal providing that such Conditional Merger  Agreement is binding on the
Seller and the Person making such Superior Proposal  at that time, but will
only become effective on and after (and in no event  before) both the (i)
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its  terms  and (ii) the
payment by such Person of the fee required to be paid under  Section  9.2(b)
on behalf of the Seller to the Parent hereto. Notwithstanding the  foregoing,
the parties further agree that in the circumstances described  in the 
immediately preceding sentence, until the termination of this Agreement in 
accordance with its terms, (1) in no event may the Seller make any SEC or 
other  regulatory filings in connection with the transactions contemplated by
such  letter agreement and Conditional Merger Agreement until the termination
of  this  Agreement except as required by Law or permitted under Section
7.2(g), and  (2)  the Seller shall otherwise remain subject to all of its
obligations under  this  Agreement (including Section 7.1 and this  Section
7.2).

 

 

 

 

(f) From  and  after the execution of this Agreement, the Seller shall
notify the Parent  as  promptly as practicable (but in any event within
twenty-four hours) of the  receipt, directly or indirectly, of any inquiries,
discussions, negotiations,  proposals or expressions of interest with respect
to, or that may reasonably  be  expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal
(including a copy of such  Acquisition Proposal and a summary of the material
terms and conditions thereof,  including price, and the identity of the
Person or Persons involved). Commencing  upon the provision of any notice
referred to above, (A) once, and not more  than  once, each day at mutually
reasonably agreeable times, the Seller (or its  outside counsel) shall, in
person or by telephone, provide the Parent (or  its  outside counsel) a
summary of the progress of negotiations concerning any  Acquisition Proposal
and the material resolved or unresolved issues (including  the positions of
the parties to such negotiations on such issues) related  thereto, including
material amendments or proposed amendments as to price  and  other material
terms of any  such  Acquisition Proposal and (B) the Seller shall, promptly
upon receipt or delivery  thereof, provide the Parent (or its outside
counsel) with copies of all drafts  and final versions (and any comments
thereon) of agreements (including schedules  and exhibits thereto) relating
to any such Acquisition Proposal exchanged  between the Seller or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the  person making an Acquisition
Proposal or any of its Representatives, on the  other hand.

  (g) Nothing  in this  _Section  7.2_   shall  prohibit the Seller from
complying with Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation  M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal  if, in the
good faith judgment of the board of directors of the Seller, after 
consultation with its outside counsel, doing so would be inconsistent with 
its  obligations under applicable Laws (it being understood that any such
disclosure  made in order to so comply may constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change  under  Section 7.2(d)). The Seller shall provide the
Parent with a copy of the  text of any disclosure proposed to be made in
order to so comply at the earliest  reasonably practicable time in advance of
such disclosure.

 

 

(h) For  the  purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior  Proposal_ " shall 
mean any _  bona  fide_   binding  unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal made by any party (other than the  Parent and its subsidiaries) that
did not result from a breach of this  _Section 7.2_,  if  consummated,
would result in such third party (or in the case of a direct merger  between
such third party and the Seller, the stockholders of such third party) 
acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the 
Seller Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Seller and 
its  subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the board of directors of the
Seller  determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor, to  be  more favorable to the Stockholders than the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement from a financial point of view, taking into
account all financial,  regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal, including  the  likelihood of consummation.

 

 

 (i) For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition  Proposal_ " means 
any proposal or offer for a direct or indirect (i) merger, tender offer, 
exchange offer, binding share exchange, recapitalization, reorganization, 
liquidation, dissolution, business combination or consolidation, or any
similar  transaction, involving the Seller or one or more subsidiaries
thereof, (ii)  sale, lease exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
acquisition or  assumption of 15% or more of the fair value of the assets of
the Seller and  subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one or a series of related
transactions,  or  (iii) purchase, tender offer, exchange offer or other
acquisition (including  by  way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or
otherwise) of beneficial  ownership (the term "beneficial ownership" for
purposes of this Agreement having  the meaning assigned thereto in Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules  and regulations thereunder) of
securities representing fifteen percent (15%)  or  more of the voting power
of the Seller; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the term " _Acquisition 
Proposal_ " shall  not include the Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated  hereby.

 

 

 (j) It  is  agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section  7.2_   by any  Representative of the Seller or any of its
subsidiaries shall be deemed to  be a  breach of this _Section  7.2_   by
the  Seller.

 

 

** 7.3 ** **_Access  to Information_.**

 

 

 

(a) Upon  reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange  of  information, the Seller, shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries  to,  afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other  representatives of the Parent, reasonable access, during normal
business  hours  during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of
its properties,  books,  contracts, commitments and records. The Seller also
shall provide the Parent  with reasonable access to the Seller's officers,
employees and agents. Neither  the Seller nor any of its subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access  to or  to disclose information where such
access or disclosure would contravene  any  law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, or binding agreement entered  into prior to the date of
this Agreement or would reasonably be expected  to  violate or result in a
loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work  product  privilege. The
parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to make  appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which  the 
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. No investigation by the Parent 
or  any of its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives  and no receipt of information by the Parent or any of its
officers, employees,  accountants, counsel and other representatives shall
operate as a waiver  or  otherwise affect any representation or warranty of
the Seller or any covenant  or  other provision in this Agreement (other
than as otherwise expressly specified  in this Agreement with respect to the
Seller Letter).

(b) With  respect to all information furnished by the Seller to the Parent or
its  representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall comply with,
and  shall  cause their respective representatives to comply with, all of
their respective  obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

**7.4 ** **_Employment  and Benefit Matters_.**

 

 

(a) _Provision  of Benefits_.  For the  period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on December 31, 2007,  the  Parent agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain the compensation  levels, including base
salary, annual cash incentive opportunities (but  not  particular historic
levels of achievement), retirement, health and welfare  benefits, but not any
stock-based benefits, for the employees of the Seller  who  remain employed
after the Effective Time (the " _Seller  Employees_ ")  at  levels which
are, in the aggregate, comparable to those in effect for the  Seller 
Employees on the date hereof; _provided_   that  neither the Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries  shall have any
obligation to maintain any plans or arrangements providing  for  stock-based
or stock-related compensation or benefits; _provided_ _further_ ,  that no 
such plans or arrangements of the Seller or any of its subsidiaries shall 
be  taken into account in determining whether compensation levels are
comparable  in  the aggregate. The Parent will treat, and cause the
applicable benefit  plans to  treat, the service of the Seller Employees
with the Seller or any subsidiary  of  the Seller attributable to any period
before the Effective Time as service  rendered to the Parent or any
Subsidiary of the Parent (i) for purposes  of  eligibility for vacation
under the Parent's vacation program, (ii) for purposes  of eligibility and
participation under any health or welfare plan maintained  by  the Parent
(other than any post-employment health or post-employment welfare  plan) and
(iii) for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the Parent's  defined
contribution plans (in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and  (iii), 
solely to the extent that the Parent makes such plan or program of the 
Parent  available to the Seller Employees and not in any case where credit
would  result  in duplication of benefits for the same period of service).
Without limiting  the  foregoing, to the extent that any Seller Employee
participates in any health  or  other group welfare benefit plan of the
Parent following the Effective  Time,  (A) the Parent shall cause any pre-
existing conditions or limitations,  eligibility waiting periods or required
physical examinations under any  health  or similar welfare plan of the
Parent to be waived with respect to the  Seller  Employees and their
eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the  corresponding plan in
which the Seller Employee participated immediately  prior  to the Effective
Time, and (B) any deductibles paid by Seller Employee  under any of the
Seller's or its Subsidiaries' health plans in the plan year in  which the
Effective Time occurs shall be credited towards deductibles under  the 
health plans of the Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent. The Parent  will
use  reasonable efforts to make appropriate arrangements with its insurance 
carrier(s) to ensure such result.

(b) _Continuation  of  Plans_.  The  Parent shall have sole discretion
with respect to the determination as to  whether or when to terminate, merge
or continue any employee benefit plans  and  programs of the Seller;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Parent shall continue to maintain the
Seller's 401(k) Retirement Plan and  the Seller's group welfare benefit plans
until the Seller Employees are  permitted to participate in the corresponding
similar plans of the Parent  or any  Subsidiary of the Parent in accordance
with _Section 7.4(a)_.

 

 

 

(c) _Continuation  of Employment_.  Without  limiting the scope of _Section
10.9_,  no  provision of this _Section 7.4_  shall  create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee  (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Seller or any subsidiary  of the
Seller in any respect, including in respect of continued employment  (or 
resumed employment) with the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of the 
Parent's Subsidiaries, and no provision of this _Section 7.4_  shall  create
such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may  be 
provided, directly or indirectly, under any Seller Benefit Plan, Seller
Benefit  Agreement, or any employee program or any plan or arrangement of the
Parent  or  any of its subsidiaries. No provision of this Agreement shall
constitute a  limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate after
the Effective  Time  any such plans or arrangements of the Parent, the
Seller or any of their  respective Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

** 7.5  ** **_Directors '  and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.**

 

 

(a) The  Parent agrees that any rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing  in  favor of the directors or officers of the Seller and the
directors or officers  of the Seller's Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified 
Parties_ " and,  each, an " _Indemnified  Party_ ")  as  provided in
their respective organizational documents, in effect as of the  date  hereof
and the indemnification agreements set forth in _Section 7.5_  of the 
Seller Letter, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Acceptance  Date shall survive the Merger (and with respect to the Seller,
shall be  reflected in the applicable organizational documents of such
entity) and  shall  continue in full force and effect until the expiration
of the applicable  statute  of limitations. During such period, the Parent
shall not, nor shall it permit  the Surviving Corporation to, amend, repeal
or otherwise modify such provisions  for indemnification in any manner that
would materially and adversely affect  the  rights thereunder of individuals
who at any time on or prior to the Acceptance  Date were directors or
officers of the Seller or directors or officers of  any  Subsidiary of the
Seller in respect of actions or omissions occurring at  or  prior to the
Acceptance Date (including the transactions contemplated by  this 
Agreement), unless such modification is required by law; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that in  the event any claim or claims are asserted or made
either prior to the  Acceptance Date or the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations,  all  rights to indemnification in respect of any
such claim or claims shall continue  until disposition of any and all such
claims.

(b) At  or  prior to the Effective Time, the Seller shall purchase a "tail"
directors' and  officers' liability insurance policy for the Seller and its
directors and  officers in a form reasonably acceptable to the Parent that
shall provide  such  directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years
following the Effective  Time of not less than the existing coverage and have
other terms not materially  less favorable to the insured Persons (including
the Seller) than the directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage
presently maintained by the Seller;  _provided_ _that_   the  aggregate
cost of such policy shall not exceed 350% of the annual premium  paid  by
the Seller for its existing directors' and officers' liability insurance 
coverage (the " _Premium  Limit_ "),  which  350% amount the Seller
represents and warrants to be equal to $1,522,500,  and in  the event that
the Premium Limit is insufficient for such coverage, the  Seller  shall
purchase the maximum amount of coverage that is available for such  amount. 
The Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain 
such  policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations  thereunder.

 

 

(c) The  obligations under this _Section 7.5_  shall  not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any  indemnitee to whom this
_Section 7.5_  applies  without the consent of such affected indemnitee. It
is expressly agreed  that the  indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.5_ 
applies  shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_  and 
shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein.

 

 

(d) In  the  event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person  and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such  consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially  all  of its properties and assets, then, and in each such
case, to the extent  necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns  of  the Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, assume the  obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_.

 

 

** 7.6  ** **_Additional  Agreements_.** **   **In  case  at any time
after the Acceptance Date (including after the Effective Time)  any  further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the Transaction or  to vest 
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, 
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, 
the  proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their  respective subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may
be  reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, the Parent.

 

 

 

** 7.7  ** **_Advice  of Changes_.** **   **The  Parent and the Seller
shall each promptly notify the other party of any  change  or event having a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Seller Material  Adverse  Effect, as the
case may be, or which it believes would otherwise be reasonably  likely to
cause or constitute a material breach of its representations,  warranties or
covenants contained herein; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section  7.7_   shall  not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the  party  receiving
such notice.

The Parent and the Purchaser, on the one  hand, and the  Seller, on the
other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable,  consult  with each
other before making, and give each other a reasonable opportunity  to 
review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements  with 
respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such press  release

securities  exchange or national securities quotation system. The parties
agree  that all  formal Seller employee communication programs or
announcements with  respect to  the transactions contemplated by this

agreement not to be unreasonably withheld  or  delayed).

 

 

** 7.9  ** **_Rule  16b-3 Actions_.** **** Promptly  after the date hereof
and prior to the Expiration Date, the Seller  shall take  all such steps as
may be required to cause any dispositions of shares  of Seller  Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Seller  Common  Stock)

individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section  16(a) of
the  Exchange Act with respect to the Seller to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable 
Law.

 

 

** 7.10  ** **_Rule  14d-10 Matters_.** **   **(a)   Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller  and its 
Subsidiaries will not, after the date hereof, enter into, establish,  amend
or  modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which 
compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are  provided,
in  each case to any Seller Personnel unless, prior to such entry into, 
establishment, amendment or modification, the Seller Compensation Committee 
shall have taken all such steps as may be necessary to (i) approve  as an 
Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement  or 
arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive  safe
harbor  under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such 
plan,  program, agreement, arrangement, understanding, payment or  benefit.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) In  the  event that, during the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and  ending  not less than five days prior to Expiration Date, the
Parent requests that  the  Seller Compensation Committee consider whether
any plan, program, agreement  or  arrangement that the Parent would like to
enter into, establish, amend or  modify  pursuant to which compensation is
paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits  are provided, in each case to
any Seller Personnel (each such plan, program,  agreement or arrangement, a "
_Post-Signing  Arrangement_ "),  would  constitute an Employment
Compensation Arrangement and provides the Seller  with  such information
with respect to such Post-Signing Arrangement as the Seller  may  reasonably
request, the Seller Compensation Committee will promptly, and  in any  event
prior to the Expiration Date, consider such Post-Signing Arrangement  at a 
meeting duly called and held. In the event that, following such
consideration,  the Seller Compensation Committee believes in good faith that
such Post-Signing  Arrangement constitutes an Employment Compensation
Arrangement, at such meeting  the Seller Compensation Committee shall take
all such steps as may be necessary  to (i) approve as an Employment
Compensation Arrangement such plan, program,  agreement or arrangement and
(ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive  safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to  such  plan, program,
agreement, arrangement, understanding, payment or  benefit.
