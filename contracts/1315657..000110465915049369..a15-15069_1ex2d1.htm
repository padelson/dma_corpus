1.9_ and _3_ hereof). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are
defined in Exhibit A.

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub

DGCL. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the
Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

B. The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously: (a)
approved this Agreement and the Merger; (b) determined that the Merger is
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; (c)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger; and (d)
resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement.

 



 

C. The respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
this Agreement and the Merger.

 



 

D. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause the Merger
to be consummated, certain stockholders of the Company are executing voting

E. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause the Merger
to be consummated, each party listed on _Schedule A_ hereto is executing a
noncompetition and non-solicitation agreement in favor of Parent concurrently

AGREEMENT

 



 

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 



 

 **Section 1.** **DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION**

 



 

1.1 _Merger of Merger Sub into the Company_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in
_Section 1.3_), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

1.2 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

1.3 _Closing; Effective Time_. The consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, 555 California Street, San
Francisco, California 94104, at 8:00 a.m. (California time) on a date to be
designated by agreement between the Company and Parent, which shall be no
later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last
to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6_ and _7_
(other than the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.5_ and _7.3_ , which by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions). The date on which the
Closing actually takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the
applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company in
connection with the Closing and, concurrently with or as soon as practicable
following the Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of such
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as may be specified in such certificate of merger with the
consent of Parent (the time as of which the Merger becomes effective being
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in its entirety pursuant to the Merger at the Effective Time or
immediately thereafter to conform to the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at
the Effective Time or immediately thereafter to conform to the Bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 



 

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

1.5 _Conversion of Shares_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

 



 

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this _Section 1.5(a)_
and subject to _Sections 1.5(b)_ , _1.5(c)_ , _1.7_ and _1.8_ , each share of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ "), without interest; and

 



 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending
at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are
changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during such
period, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during
such period, then the consideration to be delivered in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(iii)_ shall be adjusted to
the extent appropriate.

 



 

(c) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other Contract with the Company or under which the Company has
any rights, then (except to the extent provided in any binding agreement
between the Company and the holder thereof and except to the extent Parent
otherwise elects), the Merger Consideration delivered in exchange for such
shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition and need not be paid
until such time as such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition lapses or otherwise terminates. The Company shall take all action
that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set
forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract. The
Company shall perform the obligations set forth on _Schedule 1.5(c_ ).

 



 

1.6 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time: (a) all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of
any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer
books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid
certificate previously representing any

 



      
 

 



 

shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to the Paying Agent (as
defined in _Section 1.7_) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such
Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided
in _Section 1.7_.

 



 

1.7 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ").
Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within one business day
thereafter), Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash
sufficient to make payments of the cash consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 1.5_ (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that (i) no such
investment of or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments
required by this _Section 1_, or affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock, and following any
losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent in
the amount of any such losses, and (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement. Any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to such
funds shall become part of the Payment Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under this Agreement shall be promptly returned to either
Parent or the Surviving Corporation. The Payment Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) pay all charges and expenses, including those of the
Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common
Stock and the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five business
days thereafter), the Paying Agent will mail to the Persons who were record
holders of Company Stock Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time:
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that
delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such
Company Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book Entry
Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal) and in such form reasonably acceptable to the Company; and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates
and Book Entry Shares in exchange for Merger Consideration. Exchange of any
Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Paying Agents
customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.
Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share to the
Paying Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal
and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent:
(A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 1.5_,
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate; and (B) the
Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company
Common Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than

 



      
 

 



 

the holder in whose name the Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share
formerly representing such shares is registered if (1) any such Company Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and (2) such holder shall have paid any fiduciary or surety bonds and
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of such
Merger Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such bonds and Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable). Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 1.7(b)_, each Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share
shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 1.5_. If
any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the delivery of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate
to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as
Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 1.7_.

 



 

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates as of the date that is 270 days after the date on
which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand,
and any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have
not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry
Shares in accordance with this _Section 1.7_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Common Stock or a Company Equity Award such amounts as may be required
to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(e) If any Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share has not been
surrendered by the earlier of: (i) the fifth anniversary of the date on which
the Merger becomes effective; or (ii) the date immediately prior to the date
on which the cash amount that such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry
Share represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Body, then such cash amount shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other
Person

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar

any and all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or
nonperformance directly against either or both of Holdings and Parent in the
first instance. This _Section 1.9_ shall not be amended, modified or

Corporations, including all buildings, structures, fixtures and other
improvements leased to the Acquired Corporations, are referred to as the "
_Leased Real Property_.") The present use and operation of the Leased Real
Property is authorized by, and is in material compliance with, all applicable
Legal Requirements. There is no Legal Proceeding pending, or to the Knowledge
of the Company threatened, that challenges or adversely affects, or would
challenge or adversely affect, the continuation of the present use or
operation of any Leased Real Property. There are no subleases, licenses,
occupancy agreements or other contractual obligations that grant the right of
use or occupancy of any of the Leased Real Property to any Person other than
the Acquired Corporations, and there is no Person in possession of any of the
Leased Real Property other than the Acquired Corporations.

 



   

     
 

 



 

(b) All servers, other material hardware relating to any Company Service and
other material items of equipment and other tangible assets owned by or leased
to the Acquired Corporations are adequate for the uses to which they are being
put, are in good and safe condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) and, with due regard to the age thereof, taken as a whole are
adequate for the conduct of the businesses of the Acquired Corporations in the
manner in which such businesses are currently being conducted.

in the name of any of the Acquired Corporations (whether exclusively, jointly
with another Person or otherwise) (" _Company Registered IP_ "); and (B) the
jurisdiction in which such item of Company Registered IP has been registered
or filed. No Person has, or has alleged in writing to have, or, to the

Corporation that such Person has, an ownership interest in any item of Company
Owned IP;

 



 

(ii) in Part 2.9(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule each item of

Agreements), licenses for Open Source Code, and non-exclusive agreements for
any third-party Intellectual Property that is generally available to the
public on standard commercial terms at a cost of less than $75,000 in any
calendar year, provided that such Intellectual Property is not distributed by
any Acquired Corporation, or is not incorporated into any Company Service, or
is not otherwise material to the Acquired Corporations business); and (y)
whether the licenses or rights granted to the Acquired Corporation in each
such Contract are exclusive or non-exclusive (for purposes of this Agreement,
a covenant not to sue or not to assert infringement claims shall be deemed to
be equivalent to a license).

each standard form of the following documents and Contracts used by any

that do not materially differ in substance from the applicable form Made
Available to Parent pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_, Contracts identified in
Part 2.9(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (or expressly excluded by
_Section 2.9(a)(iii)_ from an obligation to so identify in Part 2.9(a)(iii)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule) or agreements for third-party Intellectual
Property that is generally available to the public) free and clear of any
Encumbrances (other than: (x) non-exclusive rights granted by any Acquired
Corporation in connection with the provision of Company Services in the
ordinary course of business; or (y) as would not, and would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the
use of such Company Owned IP in providing any Company Services). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing:

 



 

(i) the Acquired Corporations have secured from each Company Associate who is
or was involved in the creation or development of any Company Owned IP,
Company Service or Company Service Software a valid and enforceable agreement
(" _Personnel Agreements_ ") containing: (A) an irrevocable (except to the
extent limited by reversionary rights under U.S. copyright law) assignment of
all Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights created or
developed by such Company Associate in the course of that Company Associates
work for any Acquired Corporation, including all such Intellectual Property
and Intellectual Property Rights pertaining to any Company Owned IP, Company
Service or Company Service Software; and (B) confidentiality provisions
protecting confidential portions of such Company Owned IP, Company Service or
Company Service Software;

 



 

(ii) no Company Associate has any claim, right (whether or not currently
exercisable) or interest to or in any Company Owned IP (other than a non-
exclusive license as a customer or user of any Company Service pursuant to the
applicable form Made Available to Parent pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_);

 



 

(iii) no funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Body or any
university, college, research institute or other educational institution have
been or are being used, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of any
Acquired Corporation, to develop or create, in whole or in part, any Company
Owned IP, Company Service or Company Service Software, and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, no Company Associate who was involved in, or who contributed
to, the creation or development of any Company Owned IP performed services for
any Governmental Body,

 



      
 

 



 

university, college, research institute or other educational institution
during a period of time during which such Company Associate was also
performing services for any Acquired Corporation, in each case, except as
would not have and would not reasonably be expected to have or result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(iv) each Acquired Corporation has taken reasonable steps to maintain the
confidentiality of and otherwise protect and enforce its rights in all Trade
Secrets and other proprietary or confidential information pertaining to the
Acquired Corporations, the Company Owned IP, the Company Service, or the
business of the Acquired Corporations, other than upon the issuance or
publication of a Patent;

 



 

(v) none of the Acquired Corporations is now or has ever been a member or
promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or any similar
organization that requires or obligates any of the Acquired Corporations to
grant or offer to any other Person any license or right to any Company Owned
IP;

 



 

(vi) except as would not be material to the Acquired Corporations taken as a
whole, to the extent that any development work has been performed by or on
behalf of any Acquired Corporation alone, jointly with a Distribution Provider
or by any other Person to integrate any Acquired Corporations systems with
the systems or technology of any Distribution Provider, no Distribution
Provider or any other Person involved therewith has any ownership claim,
ownership right (whether or not currently exercisable) or ownership interest
to or in any Company Owned IP, Company Service or Company Service Software and
arising out of such development work;

 



 

(vii) to the Knowledge of the Company, the Acquired Corporations own or
otherwise have, and immediately after the Closing the Surviving Corporation
will continue to have, all Intellectual Property Rights that are necessary to
the provision of any Company Service by the Acquired Corporations as currently
provided; and

 



 

(viii) the Company has Made Available to Parent a full and complete copy of
that certain agreement, as amended, listed on Schedule 2.9(c)(viii).

 



 

(d) All Company Registered IP (other than pending applications) is subsisting
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, valid and enforceable, as of the date of
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the
date of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) all filings, payments and other actions required to be made or taken by an
Acquired Corporation to maintain each item of Company Registered IP in full
force and effect have been properly made and taken, except where the Company
has reasonably decided to cease prosecution or maintenance or to otherwise
abandon such Company Registered IP; and

 



 

(ii) no interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination, cancellation or
other Legal Proceeding of any nature is or has been pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any Acquired Corporation or
Company

 



      
 

 



 

Registered IP, since January 1, 2011, in which the scope, validity or
enforceability of any Company Registered IP is being, has been or would
reasonably be expected to be contested or challenged, other than office
actions or similar communications issued by any Governmental Body in the
ordinary course of prosecution of any pending applications for registration of
Company Registered IP, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no
reasonable basis for a claim that any Company Registered IP is invalid or
unenforceable.

 



 

(e) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will, with or without notice or the lapse of time, pursuant to any
Company Contract, result in or give any other Person the right or option to
cause, create, impose or declare: (i) a loss of, or Encumbrance on, any
Company Owned IP; or (ii) the grant, assignment or transfer to any other
Person of any license or other right or interest under, to or in any of the
Company Owned IP.

 



 

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has infringed, misappropriated
or otherwise violated, and no Person is infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating, any Company Owned IP, except as would not have and would
not reasonably be expected to have or result, individually or in the
aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Part 2.9(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule: (i) accurately identifies (and the Company has provided
to Parent an accurate and complete copy of) each letter or other written or
electronic communication or correspondence that has been sent or otherwise
delivered by or to any of the Acquired Corporations or any Representative of
any of the Acquired Corporations since January 1, 2011 regarding any actual,
alleged or suspected infringement or misappropriation of any Company Owned IP;
and (ii) provides a brief description of the current status of the matter
referred to in such letter, communication or correspondence.

 



 

(g) None of the Acquired Corporations and none of the exploitation of Company
Owned IP, Company Services or Company Service Software infringes, violates or
makes unlawful use of any Intellectual Property Right of, or contains any
Intellectual Property misappropriated from, any other Person, or has ever
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
Right of any other Person; _provided that_ , with respect to patent and
trademark rights, the foregoing statement is made only to the Knowledge of the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, _Sections
2.9(g)-(i)_ contain the only representations or warranties made by the
Company with respect to infringement, misappropriation or violation of
Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person.

 



 

(h) No claim or Legal Proceeding with respect to infringement,
misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property Right of any other
Person is or, from January 1, 2011 through the date of this Agreement, has
been pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any
Acquired Corporation or, to the Knowledge of the Company, against any other
Person who is, or has asserted to any Acquired Corporation in writing (or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, other than in writing) that it is entitled to be
indemnified, defended, held harmless or reimbursed by any Acquired Corporation
with respect to such claim or Legal Proceeding (including any claim or Legal
Proceeding that has been settled, dismissed or otherwise concluded), and, from
January 1, 2011 through the date of this Agreement, none of the Acquired
Corporations has received any written requests or written

 



      
 

 



 

notices (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, other requests or notices) from
any third party alleging that the Company or any other Acquired Corporation is
obligated to indemnify, defend, or hold them harmless with respect to any such
claim or Legal Proceeding.

 



 

(i) Since January 1, 2011, (A) none of the Acquired Corporations has received
any written notice or other written communication relating to any actual,
alleged or suspected infringement, misappropriation or violation of any
Intellectual Property Right of another Person by any of the Acquired
Corporations, the Company Services or the Company Service Software, and, (B)
to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Acquired Corporations has
received any non-written notice or other non-written communication relating to
any actual, alleged or suspected infringement, misappropriation or violation
of any Intellectual Property Right of another Person by any of the Acquired
Corporations, the Company Services or the Company Service Software (in the
case of (A) and (B) including any letter or other communications suggesting or
offering that the Company obtain a license to any Intellectual Property Rights
of another Person in a manner that reasonably implies such infringement,
misappropriation or violation).

 



 

(j) To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, none of
the Company Service Software contains any bug, defect or error (including any
bug, defect or error relating to or resulting from the display, manipulation,
processing, storage, transmission or use of data) that materially and
adversely affects the use, functionality or performance of such Company
Service Software or any Company Service using, containing or including such
Company Service Software.

 



 

(k) Part 2.9(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies and
describes: (i) each item of Open Source Code that is contained or embodied in,
distributed with or used in the development of the Company Service Software or
from which any part of the Company Service Software is derived; (ii) the
version or versions of each such item of Open Source Code; (iii) the Company
Service Software to which each such item of Open Source Code relates; and (iv)
whether (and if so, how) each such item of Open Source Code has been
distributed or modified by or for the Company. Each Acquired Corporations
use, marketing, distribution, licensing, and sale of Company Service Software
does not materially violate any license terms applicable to any item of Open
Source Code, and each Acquired Corporation has all rights in each item of Open
Source Code disclosed, or required to be disclosed, in Part 2.9(k) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule as needed for the Acquired Corporations to conduct
the business of the Acquired Corporations as currently conducted, without
material violation of any license terms pertaining to such Open Source Code.
The Company has complied in all material respects with all applicable
licensing terms pertaining to each item of Open Source Code disclosed, or
required to be disclosed, in Part 2.9(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
No Company Service Software contains, is combined with, is derived from, is
distributed, by or on behalf of any Acquired Corporation, with or is being or
was developed using Open Source Code in a manner that, or using Open Source
Code that is licensed, in connection with the manner in which such Open Source
Code has been used by or on behalf of any Acquired Corporation, under terms
that: (A) imposes or would impose a requirement or condition that any Company
Service Software or part thereof (other than such Open Source Code): (1) be
disclosed or distributed in source code form; (2) be licensed for the purpose
of making modifications or derivative works; or (3) be redistributable at no
charge; or (B) otherwise imposes or would

 



      
 

 



 

impose any other material limitation, restriction, or condition on the right
or ability of the Acquired Corporations to use or distribute any Company
Service Software (other than such Open Source Code), other than requirements
of attribution, copyright notices or warranty disclaimers, or restrictions on
the use with code licensed under other incompatible open source licenses.

 



 

(l) No Company Source Code has been delivered, licensed or made available to
any escrow agent or other Person (other than (i) employees of any Acquired
Corporation and (ii) consultants and independent contractors working on behalf
of any Acquired Corporation under a commercially reasonable form of
nondisclosure agreement). None of the Acquired Corporations has any duty or
obligation (whether present, contingent or otherwise) to deliver, license or
make available any Company Source Code to any escrow agent or other Person.
Part 2.9(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Company
Contract pursuant to which any Acquired Corporation is or may become obligated
pursuant to the terms thereof (with or without the passage of time, the
occurrence of certain events or otherwise) to provide Company Source Code to
any Person. No event has occurred, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time) will result in the delivery, license or disclosure of the source code
for any Company Service Software from any escrow agent to any other Person.

 



 

(m) The Company IT Systems are in reasonably good working condition to
effectively perform all information technology operations necessary to conduct
the business of the Acquired Corporations, except as would not have and would
not reasonably be expected to have or result, individually or in the
aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Acquired Corporations
maintain and are in compliance with policies and procedures regarding data
security, back-up, disaster recovery and privacy that are commercially
reasonable and, in any event are in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements, except in any event as would not have and would not reasonably
be expected to have or result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither any Acquired
Corporation, nor any subcontractor or agent of any Acquired Corporation, since
January 1, 2011, has failed, or has had a material problem or non-conformity
identified in, any audit (whether internal or external) of the Company IT
Systems. To the Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2013, there have
been no (i) material failures of computer services or other information
technology assets that have caused disruptions that are material to the
business of any Acquired Corporation, or (ii) security breaches relating to,
violations of any security policy regarding or any unauthorized access of any
data used in the business of any Acquired Corporation or (iii) legally
required notices sent to individuals of any such information security event,
incident, or breach.

 



 

(n) As of the date of this Agreement, no claim or Legal Proceeding relating to
any and all Personal Data or other data and information concerning individuals
used or disseminated by the Acquired Corporations since January 1, 2013 has
been pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing
against any Acquired Corporation or, to the Knowledge of the Company, against
any other Person who is, or has asserted or would reasonably be expected to
assert that it is, entitled to be indemnified, defended, held harmless or
reimbursed by any Acquired Corporation with respect to such claim or Legal
Proceeding (including any claim or Legal Proceeding that has been settled,
dismissed or otherwise concluded), and, since January 1, 2013, none of the
Acquired Corporations has received any

 



      
 

 



 

written requests or written notices from any third party alleging that the
Company or any other Acquired Corporation is obligated to indemnify, defend,
or hold them harmless with respect to any such claim or Legal Proceeding.

 



 

(o) _Privacy Policies_. The Company, the Company Service Software and the
collection, use and dissemination of any and all data and information
concerning individuals by the Acquired Corporations, have complied at all
times with the privacy policies and terms of use of the Acquired Corporations
and with all applicable Legal Requirements relating to the collection, use,
storage, dissemination or transfer of any such data or information or
otherwise pertaining to privacy, User Data, Personal Data or spyware, to the
Knowledge of the Company. Each registered user of any Acquired Corporation Web
Site is presented with web site terms of use and privacy policy in the form
Made Available to Parent, which are intended to be legally valid and
enforceable. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement or any of the other agreements, documents or
instruments referred to in this Agreement; the consummation of the Merger or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result in any
violation of any privacy policy of any Acquired Corporation or terms of use of
any Acquired Corporation Web Site or any applicable Legal Requirement
pertaining to privacy, User Data or Personal Data. Part 2.9(o) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains each Acquired Corporation Privacy Policy in
effect at any time since May 22, 2012. At all times, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the appropriate Acquired Corporation Privacy Policy was displayed on
the applicable Acquired Corporation Web Site. To the Knowledge of the Company,
none of the Acquired Corporations has obtained, collected, used or transferred
any User Data, or possessed any data that is not publicly available in a
manner where, if such collection, use or transfer violated or breached of any
Acquired Corporation Privacy Policy, Company Contract, or applicable Legal
Requirement, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227,
EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC as
implemented by EU Member States (which in relation to the EU Data Protection
Directive 95/46/EC and the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC shall apply to all
Personal Data whether User Data or otherwise).

 



 

(p) _Ownership and Use of Data_. All Acquired Corporation Data is owned by the
Acquired Corporations free and clear of all Encumbrances and is not subject to
any Company Contract or the Acquired Corporations otherwise have all
applicable rights as may be necessary in such Acquired Corporation Data to
conduct the business of the Company as currently conducted. The Acquired
Corporations have all necessary and required rights to use, reproduce, modify,
create derivative works of, license, sublicense, distribute and otherwise
exploit the data contained in the Acquired Corporation Data, in each case as
such is conducted in connection with the operation of the business of each
Acquired Corporation.

 



 

(q) _Information Security_. All Company IT Systems have been properly
maintained, in all material respects, by technically competent personnel, in
accordance with standards set by the manufacturers or otherwise in accordance
with standards prudent in the industry, including the Payment Card Industry
Data Security Standard, as adopted by the PCI Security Standards Council, LLC
(the " _PCI DSS_ "), designed to ensure their proper operation, monitoring and
use and the security of Personal Data and User Data. The Acquired Corporations
have established and are in compliance in all material respects with a written
information security program that: (i) includes administrative, technical and
physical safeguards designed to

 



      
 

 



 

safeguard the security, confidentiality, and integrity of transactions and
Acquired Corporation Data; (ii) is designed to protect against unauthorized
access to the Company IT Systems or Acquired Corporation Data and the systems
of any third party service providers that have access to Acquired Corporation
Data or Company IT Systems; and (iii) satisfies the requirements of the PCI
DSS. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Acquired Corporations is in
breach of any Contract related to any Company IT Systems or is aware of any
event that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would
constitute a breach of any Company Contract related to any Company IT Systems
or the requirements of the PCI DSS, except as disclosed in Part 2.9(q) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(r) The Acquired Corporations have taken commercially reasonable measures to
provide for the back-up and recovery of the data and information necessary to
the conduct of the business of the Acquired Corporations (including such data
and information that is stored on magnetic or optical media in the ordinary
course) without material disruption to, or material interruption in, the
conduct of the business of the Acquired Corporations except as would not have
and would not reasonably be expected to have or result, individually or in the
aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(s) _User Agreements_. Part 2.9(s) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
accurately and completely identifies each Acquired Corporation User Agreement
in effect at any time since April 23, 2013, and identifies, with respect to
each Acquired Corporation User Agreement, the period of time during which such
Acquired Corporation User Agreement was or has been in effect. Each Acquired
Corporation User Agreement is binding and enforceable with respect to each and
every applicable user of each Company Service Software.

(h) Each of the Acquired Corporations has performed in all material respects
all obligations required to be performed by it under each Company Employee
Plan, and each Company Employee Plan has been established and maintained in

provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Legal Requirements. Any Company
Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has
obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable)
as to its qualified status under the Code. All Company Employee Plans required
to have been approved by any non-U.S. Governmental Body have been so approved,
no such approval has been revoked (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has
revocation been threatened) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has

Company Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA; (ii) "multiemployer plan"

Section 413 of the Code. No Company Employee Plan is or has been funded by,
associated with or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary association"
within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Company Employee Plan
subject to ERISA holds stock of any of the Acquired Corporations as a plan
asset. Except as would not otherwise result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or
the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations, with respect to all current and former participants in such
Foreign Plan according to the reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations
most recently used to determine employer contributions to and obligations
under such Foreign Plan, and neither the Merger nor any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will cause any such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.

 



 

(j) None of the Acquired Corporations maintains, sponsors or contributes to
any Company Employee Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan (as such
term is defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and that is, in whole or in part,

cost to the Acquired Corporations), or reflects or represents any Liability of
any of the Acquired Corporations to provide, post-termination or retiree life
insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other post-
termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any reason,
except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal Requirements.
Other than commitments made that involve no future costs to any of the
Acquired Corporations, none of the Acquired Corporations has ever represented,
promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Company
Associate (either individually or to Company Associates as a group) or any
other Person that such Company Associate(s) or other Person would be provided
with post-termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree
health benefit or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits,
except to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. There are no
liabilities of the Acquired Corporations with respect to any Company Employee
Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the financial statements
of the Company in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(k) Except as expressly required or provided by this Agreement, neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement would reasonably be expected to
(either alone or upon the occurrence of termination of employment) constitute
an event under any Company Employee Plan, Company Employee Agreement, trust or
loan that may result (either alone or in connection with any other
circumstance or event) in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company Associate,
or to create or otherwise result in any Liability with respect to any Company
Employee Plan.

 



 

(l) Each of the Acquired Corporations: (i) is in compliance in all material
respects with any Order or arbitration award of any court, arbitrator or any

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Body respecting employment, employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment, wages, hours or other labor related matters; and
(ii) has withheld and reported all amounts required by applicable Legal
Requirements or by Contract to be withheld and reported with respect to wages,
salaries and other payments to Company Associates. No Acquired Corporation or
Company Affiliate: (A) is liable for any arrears of wages or any taxes or any
interest or penalty for failure to comply with the Legal Requirements
applicable of the foregoing; or (B) is liable for any payment to any trust or
other fund governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body
with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social security, social
charges or other benefits or obligations for Company Associates (other than
routine payments to be made in the normal course of business and consistent
with past practice).

 



 

(m) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
director or officer or other employee of an Acquired Corporation, and no
payments have been made or will be made to any director or officer or other
employee of an Acquired Corporation, that, considered individually or
considered collectively with any other such Contracts or payments, will, or
would reasonably be expected to, result in any payment that will not be
deductible by the Acquired Corporations by reason of Section 280G of the Code,
or give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount that would
not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code (or any comparable
provision under U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax Legal Requirements). No
Acquired Corporation is a party to or has any obligation under any Contract to
compensate any Person for excise taxes payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code or any taxes required by Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(n) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither: (i) the execution or delivery of
this Agreement; nor (ii) the carrying on of the business of any Acquired
Corporation as presently conducted or any activity of any director or officer
or other employee of an Acquired Corporation in connection with the carrying
on of the business of any Acquired Corporation as currently conducted, will or
would reasonably be expected to conflict with, result in a breach of the
terms, conditions or provisions of or constitute a default under any Contract
by which any such director or officer or other employee is now bound.

 



 

(o) Since January 1, 2011, none of the Acquired Corporations has effectuated a

facility of any of the Acquired Corporations.

 



 

(p) Each Company Employee Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has
been operated and administered in material compliance with Section 409A of the
Code.

operations of any of the Acquired Corporations); or

 



 

(vi) result in, or increase the likelihood of, the disclosure or delivery to
any escrowholder or other Person of any Company Owned IP (including Company

for engaging in such conduct in such jurisdiction without a Money Transmitter
License; and (IV) each jurisdiction which would require any Acquired

(xvii) enter into any Contract covering any Company Associate, or, other than

considered individually or considered collectively with any other such
Contracts or payments, will, or would reasonably be expected to, be
characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code or give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of
any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code
(or any comparable provision under U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax Legal
Requirements);

 



 

(xviii) take any action or omit to take any action that is reasonably likely
to result in any of the conditions to the merger set forth in _Section 6_ not
being satisfied;

 



 

(xix) fail to take any actions in order to maintain in full force and effect

(xx) except as set forth in Part 4.2(b)(xx) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, enter into any Contracts with Distribution Providers or any other
Person to provide Company Services in any country in which any of the Acquired
Corporations are not currently conducting business;

 



 

(xxi) cancel any insurance policies identified in Part 2.18 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or reduce the amount of any insurance coverage provided by

(xxii) agree or commit to take any of the actions described in clauses "(i)"
through "(xxi)" of this _Section 4.2(b)_.

 



 

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, (i) the Company shall promptly notify
Parent in writing of: (x) any Stockholder Litigation; and (y) any fact, event
or circumstance known to it that would reasonably be expected, individually or
taken together with all other existing facts, events and circumstances known
to it, to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section
6_ to be satisfied; and (ii) Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would reasonably
be expected, individually or taken together with all other existing facts,

that that no notification given by any party pursuant to this _Section
4.2(c)_ shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement.

 



 

4.3 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Following the execution of this Agreement: (i) the Company shall, and
shall ensure that the other Acquired Corporations and each Person that is a
Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions or
negotiations with, any Person relating to any Acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; and (ii) the Company shall promptly request
each Person that has previously executed a confidentiality or similar
agreement in connection with such Persons consideration of an Acquisition
Proposal or investment in any Acquired Corporation to return to the Company or
destroy any non-public information previously furnished to such Person or to
any of such Persons Representatives by or on behalf of any of the Acquired
Corporations.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.2(d)_ and except as permitted by this _Section
4.3(b)_, the Company shall not (and shall not publicly propose to) directly or
indirectly, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
other Acquired Corporations and each Person that is a Representative of any of
the Acquired Corporations do not (and do not publicly propose to) directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, assist, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate the submission, announcement or making of any Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry by any Person, or take any action that would reasonably
be expected to lead a Person to disclose, announce, commence, submit or
otherwise make an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry ( _provided,
however_ , that supplying non-public information in the ordinary course of
business not in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry and where not reasonably expected to lead a Person to
disclose, announce, commence, submit or otherwise make an Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry, shall not be prohibited by this clause "(i)"); (ii)
furnish or otherwise provide access to any information regarding any of the
Acquired Corporations to any Person in connection with or in response to an
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; or (iii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry; _provided, however_ , that, subject to _Section 4.3(c)_
and the other provisions of this Agreement, prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company may, without
being deemed to violate this _Section 4.3(b)_, furnish non-public information
regarding the Acquired Corporations to, and enter into and maintain (but only
during such period of time such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Offer) discussions or negotiations
with, any Person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal that is submitted to the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn),
but only if: (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of any
of the provisions set forth in this _Section 4.3_ or in _Section 5.2_; (B)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after having taken into account
the advice of an independent financial advisor and the advice of the Companys
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Offer; and (C) prior to furnishing
any such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, the Company (1) gives Parent written notice of
the identity of such Person and of the Companys intention to furnish non-
public information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, and (2) receives from such Person, and delivers to Parent a copy of,
an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(c) Prior to furnishing or otherwise permitting the transmittal of any non-
public information to any Person pursuant to the proviso to _Section 4.3(b)_,
the Company shall (as a condition to furnishing or otherwise permitting the
transmittal of such non-public information to such Person) furnish such non-
public information to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has
not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent).

 



   

     
 

 



 

(d) If the Company, any other Acquired Corporation or any Representative of
any Acquired Corporation receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry or any request for non-public information at any time following the
execution of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, then the Company
shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request) advise Parent in writing
of such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request (including the
identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal,
Acquisition Inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions thereof).
Following the execution of this Agreement: (i) the Company shall promptly (and
in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide Parent with copies of
all documents and communications received by any Acquired Corporation or any
Representative of any Acquired Corporation setting forth the terms and
conditions of, modifications or amendments (or proposed modifications or
amendments) to, and other material documents and communications relating to,
any Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request for non-public
information made by any Person prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably fully informed on a reasonably current
basis with respect to the status of any material developments in such
Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request and any material
modification or proposed modification thereto.

 



 

(e) The Company: (i) agrees that it will not, and shall ensure that each other
Acquired Corporation will not, at any time, release or permit the release of
any Person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any
provision of, any confidentiality or similar agreement or provision to which
any of the Acquired Corporations is or becomes a party and (ii) will use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such
agreement or provision at the request of Parent. Other than contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, none of the
Acquired Corporations are party to any effective "standstill" or similar
agreement or provision.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act
or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board or any committee thereof, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Delaware
law (it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of
a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
shall not in and of itself constitute an Adverse Change Recommendation);
_provided, however_ , that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act other than (A) a "stop, look and listen"
communication limited solely to the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act or (B) any express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal, shall be deemed to be an Adverse Change Recommendation. No change,
withdrawal or modification in the recommendation of the Company Board to the
Companys stockholders with respect to this Agreement or the Merger shall
change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any state
takeover Legal Requirement (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or other state
Legal Requirement to be inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, further_ that this _Section
4.3(f)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to take any of

 



      
 

 



 

the actions referred to in _Section 5.2(c)_ except to the extent permitted by
_Section 5.2(d)_ and _Section 5.2(e)_.

 



 

(g) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any action in violation of any
provision set forth in this _Section 4.3_ or _Section 5.2_ that is taken by
any Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations shall be deemed to
constitute a breach of such provision by the Company.

 



 

 **Section 5.** **ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES**

 



 

5.1 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable (but no later than ten
business days after the date of this Agreement unless Parent, in good faith,
requests additional time to review the Proxy Statement), the Company shall
prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall consult with Parent and provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and any amendments or
supplements thereto (and to review and comment on any comments of the SEC or
its staff on the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto),
and shall reasonably consider all comments made by Parent, prior to the filing
thereof. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and all other applicable Legal
Requirements. The Company shall promptly provide Parent and its legal counsel
with a copy or a description of any comments received by the Company or its
legal counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereto, and shall respond promptly to any such
comments. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the earlier of: (i)
receiving notification that the SEC or its staff is not reviewing the Proxy
Statement; or (ii) the conclusion of any SEC or staff review of the Proxy
Statement. If any event relating to any of the Acquired Corporations occurs,
or if the Company becomes aware of any information, that should be disclosed
in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, then the Company shall
promptly inform Parent thereof and shall promptly file such amendment or
supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, mail such amendment or supplement
to the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

5.2 _Company Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal
Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of
Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose
of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Company Stockholders
Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company and Parent) as
promptly as practicable after the commencement of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Companys stockholders. The Company shall ensure that all
proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are
solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.2(d)_, the Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that: (A) the Company Board: (i) has unanimously
determined and believes that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, and (ii) unanimously recommends that the
Companys stockholders vote to adopt

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting; and (B) the Company Board
has unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement and unanimously approved
the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL. (The unanimous
determination by the Company Board that the Merger is advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders and the unanimous
recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys stockholders vote to
adopt this Agreement are collectively referred to as the " _Company Board
Recommendation_.") The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement includes
the opinions of the financial advisors referred to in _Section 2.25_.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (i) except as
provided in _Section 5.2(d)_ or _Section 5.2(e)_, withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or permit the withdrawal or
modification in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub of, the Company Board
Recommendation; (ii) recommend the approval, acceptance or adoption of, or
approve, endorse, accept or adopt, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" or in "(iv)," to the extent relating to
clauses "(i)" or "(ii)," being referred to as an " _Adverse Change
Recommendation_ "); (iii) approve or recommend, or cause or permit any
Acquired Corporation to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar document or Contract constituting or relating
directly or indirectly to, or that contemplates or is intended or would
reasonably be expected to result directly or indirectly in, an Acquisition
Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into
pursuant to _Section 4.3(b)_; or (iv) agree or publicly propose to, or permit
any Acquired Corporation or any Representative of any Acquired Corporation to
agree or publicly propose to, take any of the actions referred to in this
_Section 5.2(c)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.2(c)_,
at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make an Adverse Change
Recommendation and thereafter terminate this Agreement to enter into a
binding, definitive agreement to effect a Superior Offer (a " _Specified
Definitive Acquisition Agreement_ ") if: (i) an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (ii) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of _Section 4.3(b)_ or
_Section 5.2(c)_ of this Agreement; (iii) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after having taken into account the advice of an independent
financial advisor and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer and the failure to make the
Adverse Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board under applicable Delaware law; (iv) Parent shall have
received from the Company a prior written notice (a " _Recommendation Change
Notice_ ") of the Companys intention to make an Adverse Change Recommendation
with respect to such Superior Offer and, if applicable, terminate this
Agreement to enter into a Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement, at least
three business days prior to making any Adverse Change Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement to enter into a Specified Definitive Acquisition
Agreement, which Recommendation Change Notice shall specify the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Offer, including the identity of the Person
making the Superior Offer, and attach copies of all documents and
communications relating to such Superior Offer required to be provided to
Parent in accordance with _Section 4.3(d)_ and not previously delivered; (v)
throughout the period between the delivery of such

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation Change Notice and any Adverse Change Recommendation, the
Company engages (to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations
(and causes its Representatives to engage in good faith negotiations) with
Parent and its Representatives to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
such Superior Offer would no longer constitute a Superior Offer; (vi) after
considering the results of such negotiations with Parent and taking into
account the proposals made by Parent, if any, and after having taken into
account the advice of an independent financial advisor and the advice of the
Companys outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith that such Superior Offer remains a Superior Offer and that the
failure to make the Adverse Change Recommendation and, if applicable,
terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Definitive Acquisition
Agreement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
under applicable Delaware law; and (vii) if the Company intends to terminate
this Agreement to enter into a Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement, the
Company shall have complied with _Section 8.1(f)_. The provisions of this
_Section 5.2(d)_ shall also apply to any material change to any Acquisition
Proposal, in which case such change shall require a new Recommendation Change
Notice and the Company shall be required to comply again with the provisions
of this _Section 5.2(d)_ (except that any reference to three business days
shall instead be two business days; _provided_ that such new period shall in
no event shorten the original three business day period).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.2(c)_,
the Company Board may make an Adverse Change Recommendation, if: (i) there is
a material event, material development or material change in circumstances
that (A) does not relate to any Acquisition Inquiry or Acquisition Proposal
and (B) was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the
date of this Agreement, which event, development or change in circumstance
becomes known to the Company Board prior to the Requisite Stockholder Approval
(any such material event, material development or material change in
circumstances unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal being referred to as an "
_Intervening Event_ "); (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
having taken into account the advice of an independent financial advisor and
the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Intervening Event, failure to make an Adverse Change Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Delaware law; (iii) Parent shall have received from the Company a prior
written notice (an " _Intervening Event Notice_ ") of the Companys intention
to make an Adverse Change Recommendation with respect to such Intervening
Event at least three business days prior to making any Adverse Change
Recommendation, describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail; (iv)
throughout the period between the delivery of such Intervening Event Notice
and any Adverse Change Recommendation, the Company engages (to the extent
requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations (and caused its
Representatives to engage in good faith negotiations) with Parent and its
Representatives to amend this Agreement in such a manner that that failure to
make an Adverse Change Recommendation as a result of such Intervening Event
would no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
under applicable Delaware law; and (v) after considering the results of
negotiations with Parent and taking into account the proposals made by Parent,
if any, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith that the failure to make the Adverse
Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board under applicable Delaware law. The provisions of this _Section
5.2(e)_ shall also apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances
relating to an Intervening Event, in which case such

 



      
 

 



 

change shall require a new Intervening Event Notice and the Company shall be
required to comply again with the provisions of this _Section 5.2(e)_ (except
that any reference to three business days shall instead be two business days;
_provided_ that such new period shall in no event shorten the original three
business day period).

 



 

(f) Subject to the Companys termination rights set forth in _Section 8.1_,
the Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with _Section 5.2(a)_ shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement,
submission or making of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, any
Intervening Event or by any withdrawal or modification of the Company Board
Recommendation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
agrees not to adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose to adjourn, postpone or
cancel) the Company Stockholders Meeting (without Parents prior written
consent), except that the Company may adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting for up to three business days to the extent required to obtain the
Requisite Stockholder Approval.

 



 

5.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Option
that is vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including all Company Options that vest upon and contingent on the
Merger) (each, a " _Vested Company Option_ ") to be cancelled, terminated and
extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon the cancellation thereof the
holder of each such Vested Company Option shall be granted the right to
receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Vested Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation, an amount
(subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to: (i) the Per
Share Merger Consideration; _minus_ (ii) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (it being understood that,
if the exercise price payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock
subject to any such Company Option equals or exceeds the Per Share Merger
Consideration, then the amount payable under this _Section 5.3(a)_ with
respect to such Company Option shall be zero). Each holder of a Vested Company
Option cancelled as provided in this _Section 5.3(a)_ shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash
consideration (if any) specified in this _Section 5.3(a)_, without interest.
Parent shall cause the cash payments described in this _Section 5.3(a)_ to be
paid promptly following the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Company Option
that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
with respect to which the exercise price payable in respect of a share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option exceeds the Per Share
Merger Consideration (each, an " _Underwater Unvested Company Option_ ") to be
fully vested and exercisable and each such vested Underwater Unvested Company
Option that is not exercised as of the Effective Time shall be cancelled,
terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time without any payment to
the holder of such Underwater Unvested Company Option. Each holder of an
Underwater Unvested Company Option that is cancelled as provided in this
_Section 5.3(b)_ shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time, and with respect to which
the Per Share Merger Consideration equals or exceeds the exercise price
payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option (each, an " _In-the-Money Unvested Company Option_ "), shall be
converted into and become an option to purchase shares of Holdings Common
Stock, with such conversion effected through Holdings: (i) assuming such In-
the-Money Unvested Company Option; or (ii) replacing such In-the-Money
Unvested Company Option by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement stock
option to purchase Holdings Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either
case in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan and the terms of the stock
option agreement by which such In-the-Money Unvested Company Option is
evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under In-the-Money
Unvested Company Options assumed or replaced by Holdings shall thereupon be
converted into options with respect to Holdings Common Stock. Accordingly,
from and after the Effective Time: (A) each In-the-Money Unvested Company
Option assumed or replaced by Holdings may be exercised solely for shares of
Holdings Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Holdings Common Stock
subject to each In-the-Money Unvested Company Option assumed or replaced by
Holdings shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were subject to such In-the-Money Unvested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined
below), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Holdings Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the
Holdings Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each In-the-Money Unvested
Company Option assumed or replaced by Holdings shall be determined by dividing
the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-
Money Unvested Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to
the nearest whole cent; and (D) subject to the terms of the stock option
agreement by which such In-the-Money Unvested Company Option is evidenced, any
restriction on the exercise of any In-the-Money Unvested Company Option
assumed or replaced by Holdings shall continue in full force and effect and
the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such In-
the-Money Unvested Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result
of the assumption or replacement of such In-the-Money Unvested Company Option;
_provided, however_ , that (i) Holdings board of directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board
or any committee thereof with respect to each In-the-Money Unvested Company
Option assumed or replaced by Holdings, (ii) each In-the-Money Unvested
Company Option shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent with
those in effect under Holdings equity compensation plan and (iii) in the case
of any In-the-Money Unvested Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code
is intended to apply by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the
Code (an " _Incentive Stock Option_ "), the exercise price of the option to
purchase Holdings Common Stock, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to
such option to purchase Holdings Common Stock and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option to purchase Holdings Common Stock shall be determined
in order to comply with Section 424 of the Code and any In-the-Money Unvested
Company Option that is not an Incentive Stock Option shall be adjusted in a
manner to comply with Section 409A of the Code. The " _Conversion Ratio_ "
shall be equal to the fraction having a numerator equal to the Per Share
Merger Consideration and having a denominator equal to the

 



      
 

 



 

average of the closing sale prices of a share of Holdings Common Stock as
reported on NASDAQ for each of the 10 consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that if, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or Holdings Common Stock are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or a record
date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then the
Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly.

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU and Company Performance Share
Award that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become a right to be issued Holdings Common Stock,
with such conversion effected through Holdings, at Holdings option, either:
(i) assuming such Company RSU or Company Performance Share Award; or (ii)
replacing such Company RSU or Company Performance Share Award by issuing a
reasonably equivalent replacement right to be issued Holdings Common Stock in
substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan
and the terms of the award agreement by which such Company RSU or Company
Performance Share Award is evidenced; _provided_ that the performance
conditions applicable to any such award shall be deemed satisfied at the
target level specified in the Company Equity Plan or the terms of the
applicable award agreement. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock
under Company RSUs or Company Performance Share Awards assumed or replaced by
Holdings shall thereupon be converted into rights to be issued Holdings Common
Stock upon settlement of such assumed or replaced Company RSUs or Company
Performance Share Awards. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A)
each Company RSU or Company Performance Share Award assumed or replaced by
Holdings will represent a right to be issued solely shares of Holdings Common
Stock upon settlement thereof; (B) the number of shares of Holdings Common
Stock subject to each Company RSU or Company Performance Share Award assumed
or replaced by Holdings shall be determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company RSU or
Company Performance Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Holdings Common Stock; and (C) subject to the terms of the
award agreement by which such Company RSU or Company Performance Share Award
is evidenced, any restriction on the issuance of shares under any Company RSU
or Company Performance Share Award assumed or replaced by Holdings shall
continue in full force and effect and the term, vesting schedule and other
provisions of such Company RSU or Company Performance Share Award shall
otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of
such Company RSU or Company Performance Share Award; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) Holdings board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to
the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof
with respect to each Company RSU or Company Performance Share Award assumed or
replaced by Holdings and (ii) each Company RSU and Company Performance Share
Award shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent with those in
effect under Holdings equity compensation plan.

 



 

(e) Parent shall cause to be filed with the SEC, no later than 20 business
days after the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 relating
to the shares of Holdings Common Stock issuable with respect to the assumed
and replaced

 



      
 

 



 

In-the-Money Unvested Company Options and outstanding unvested Company RSUs
and Company Performance Share Awards, in each case to the extent that such
shares of Holdings Common Stock can be registered on a Form S-8.

 



 

(f) At the Effective Time, if Holdings so elects, Holdings may assume any or
all of the Company Equity Plans or merge any such Company Equity Plan into any
equity incentive plan of Holdings. If Holdings elects to so assume or merge
any Company Equity Plan, then, under such Company Equity Plan, Holdings shall
be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable
Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of such Company Equity Plan as of
the Effective Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves as a
result of the termination of In-the-Money Unvested Company Options that are
assumed or replaced by Holdings pursuant to _Section 5.3(c)_), except that:
(i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Holdings Common Stock;
(ii) all references in such Company Equity Plan to a number of shares of
Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of
shares of Holdings Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of
referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Conversion Ratio, and
rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Holdings Common Stock; and (iii) Holdings board of directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board
or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Company
Equity Plan; and (iv) all awards granted under such Company Equity Plan shall
be subject to administrative procedures consistent with those in effect under
Holdings equity compensation plan.

 



 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 5.3_ and to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, holders of Company Equity Awards have no rights with respect
thereto other than those specifically provided in this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

5.4 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) If Parent and Holdings elect not to maintain the Surviving Corporations
health, vacation or 401(k) plans after the Effective Time, then, subject to
any necessary transition period and subject to any applicable Parent or
Holdings plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal Requirements: (i)
all employees of the Acquired Corporations who continue employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") shall be
eligible to participate in Parents or Holdings health, vacation and 401(k)
plans, to substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of
Parent; and (ii) for purposes of determining a Continuing Employees
eligibility to participate in such plans (other than any sabbatical program),
such Continuing Employee shall receive credit under such plans (other than any
sabbatical program) for his or her years of continuous service with the
Acquired Corporations prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) For a period commencing upon the Effective Time and continuing through
December 31, 2016, Parent shall provide to the Continuing Employees total

 



      
 

 



 

compensation and benefits that in the aggregate are substantially comparable
to the compensation and benefits provided by Parent to other similarly
situated employees of Parent.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent. Except
for Indemnified Persons to the extent of their rights pursuant to _Section
5.5_, no Company Associate, and no Continuing Employee, shall be deemed to be
a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 5.4(c)_
shall limit the effect of _Section 9.8_.

 



 

(d) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least five business
days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken)
all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the
day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company
Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify
under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_"). If the Company
is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall
provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption
by the Company Board of resolutions authorizing the termination of such
Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which shall be subject to the
prior review and approval of Parent). The Company also shall take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may
reasonably request. If the distributions of assets from the trust of any
Company 401(k) Plan that is terminated pursuant to this _Section 5.4(d)_ are
reasonably anticipated to cause or result in liquidation charges, surrender
charges or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or
beneficiary of such Company 401(k) Plan or upon the Company or any
participating employer, then the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to estimate the amount of such charges or other fees and provide its
estimate of that amount in writing to Parent at least three business days
prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are
imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to this Agreement or the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall consult with Parent and shall ensure that such notification or
consultation requirements are complied with prior to the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any Company Affiliate shall
communicate with Continuing Employees regarding post-Closing employment
matters, including post-Closing employee benefits and compensation, without
the prior written approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 



 

5.5 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Acquired Corporations pursuant to: (i) each indemnification agreement as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company and any individual
who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was,
a director or officer of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ "); and
(ii) any indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses) and any
exculpation provision set forth in the articles of organization or bylaws of
the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Parents and the
Surviving Corporations obligations under

 



      
 

 



 

the preceding sentence shall continue in full force and effect for a period of
six years from the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that all rights to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any
claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent (or, at Parents option, the Company)
shall purchase a prepaid "tail" policy on the existing policy of directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of
this Agreement (" _D andO Insurance_") for a period of six years from the
Effective Time and otherwise on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable than as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum aggregate premium for such
DandO Insurance that Parent shall be required to expend shall not exceed 300% of
the amount per policy period the Company paid in its last full fiscal year
prior to the date of this Agreement as set forth in Part 2.18 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Current Premium_ ") and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that,
in the Surviving Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium.
The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have
been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by
the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors
and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect
to claims arising from acts or omissions that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the amount paid for such prepaid
policies does not exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor
the obligations thereunder.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person (that, in only the case
of the Surviving Corporation, is not an Affiliate of Parent) and shall not be
the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.5_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 5.5_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware law or any other applicable

 



   

     
 

 



 

Legal Requirement or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of
the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section 5.5_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person to whom this
_Section 5.5_ applies unless the affected Indemnified Person shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Persons to whom this _Section 5.5_ applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.5_).

 



 

5.6 _Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other
documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by any
such Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall, within ten business days after the date of this
Agreement, prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed: (i) the
notification and report forms required to be filed under the HSR Act; and (ii)
any notification or other document required to be filed in connection with the
Merger under any applicable foreign Legal Requirement relating to antitrust or
competition matters. Parent shall pay all filing fees and related expenses
with respect to the filings contemplated by the preceding sentence. The
Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable to: (A) any
inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for additional information or
documentation (including a formal request for additional information and
documentary information); and (B) any inquiries or requests received from any
state attorney general, foreign antitrust or competition authority or other
Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or competition matters. At the
request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold
separate or otherwise take or commit to take any other action with respect to
any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Acquired Corporations,
provided that any such action is conditioned upon the Closing.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.6(c)_, Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger and make effective the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but
subject to _Section 5.6(c)_, each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make
all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and
given by such party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be
obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or
otherwise) by such party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
including any Consents with state banking departments or similar agencies
required in connection with a change of control of any Acquired Corporation
holding a Money Transmitter License; (iii) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) shall
use commercially reasonable efforts

 



      
 

 



 

to promptly take, and cause its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take, all
reasonable actions and steps requested or required by a Governmental Body as a
condition to granting any consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance
and approval, to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period and to resolve such objections, if any, of the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Body, provided that Parent and Company shall only be required to
take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or
restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or restriction
is contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing; _provided, however,_ that,
with respect to the obligations to obtain a Consent relating to a change of
control of any Acquired Corporation holding a Money Transmitter License, only
after the later of (I) the End Date and (II) the time at which (1) all of the
Specified Registrations have been obtained and (2) there are no more than ten
states in the aggregate for which a Consent is required but has not been
obtained (the " _Specified Registration Approval Date_ "), Parent and the
Company agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to identify possible
alternatives that eliminate the need to obtain any Consent that has not yet
been obtained, including: (x) to the extent feasible, ceasing operations of
the Acquired Corporations, as of the Effective Time, in the applicable
jurisdiction to the extent the operations in such jurisdiction require the
Acquired Corporations to have a Money Transmitter License and surrendering
such Money Transmitter License as of the Effective Time in accordance with the
Money Transmitter Requirements in such jurisdiction, (y) entering into
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Parent (or consenting to the entry by
an Acquired Corporation into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Parent)
with Affiliates or third parties that possess the necessary licenses providing
the ability to create agency relationships to enable the Acquired Corporations
to continue to provide the Company Services in the applicable jurisdiction, or
(z) obtaining verbal or written assurances reasonably acceptable to Parent
from the applicable Governmental Body that its Consent is forthcoming and no
adverse action related to the failure to obtain such Consent will be taken
against any of the Acquired Corporations or Parent in connection with the
continued conduct of the operations of the Acquired Corporations (or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) in the
applicable jurisdiction notwithstanding the pendency of any such Consent
(clauses "(x)," "(y)" and "(z)" each, an " _Alternate Arrangement_ "). Without
limiting the rights of Parent or Merger Sub under _Section 6_ or this
_Section 5.6_, each of the Company and Parent agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another and implement and cause any
Alternate Arrangements reasonably satisfactory to it to become effective as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Specified Registration Approval
Date in order to permit the Effective Time to occur as promptly as reasonably
practicable thereafter (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6_ and _Section 7_). Each of the parties
hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cooperate with each
other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Body in
connection with the Merger and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry by or before a Governmental Body relating to the Merger, including any
proceeding initiated by a private Person, (B) keep the other party informed in
all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
or any other Governmental Body and of any material communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding the Merger, (C) subject to applicable Legal Requirements relating to
the exchange of information, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult
with the other party

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to information relating to the other parties and their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third Person and/or any Governmental Body
in connection with the Merger, other than "4(c) and 4(d) documents" as those
terms are used in the rules and regulations under the HSR Act, and (D) to the
extent permitted by the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice or such other applicable Governmental Body or other
person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.6_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement (other than with respect to Alternate Arrangements
after the Specified Registration Approval Date), neither Parent, Holdings nor
Merger Sub shall have any obligation under this Agreement (nor shall any
Acquired Corporation be permitted to agree unless Parent so directs them (and
they shall, if Parent so directs, agree to, so long as such agreements are
conditioned upon the Closing)): (i) to dispose of or transfer or cause any of
its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to commit to cause
any of the Acquired Corporations to dispose of or transfer any assets; (ii) to
discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any
product or service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to
discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise
make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make
available to any Person any technology, software or other Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Right, or to commit to cause any of the
Acquired Corporations to license or otherwise make available to any Person any
technology, software or other Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property
Right; (iv) to hold separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate
any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to
commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to hold separate any assets
or operations; (v) to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any
commitment, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to make any
commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future
operations or the future operations of any of the Acquired Corporations,
unless, in the case of this clause "(v)," such commitment relates solely to
the Acquired Corporations and would not reasonably be expected to adversely
affect in any material respect the benefits to Parent arising from this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or the ability of any of
the Acquired Corporations to operate their businesses in substantially the
same manner as conducted prior to the date hereof; or (vi) to contest any
Legal Proceeding or any order, writ, injunction or decree relating to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any of
the foregoing, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). The Company and Parent shall
provide each other with copies of any notice, report or other document filed
with, sent to or received from any Governmental Body on behalf of any of the
Acquired Corporations or Parent, as the case may be, in connection with the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company shall also provide Parent (x) any material notice, report or other
document received by any of the Acquired Corporations from any Governmental
Body in connection with Money Transmitter Requirements promptly following the
receipt of such notice, report or other document and (y) notice of any inquiry
from a Governmental Body regarding the Companys compliance with Legal
Requirements promptly following the receipt of such inquiry.

 



 

5.7 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its

 



      
 

 



 

part under applicable Legal Requirements and the rules and policies of NASDAQ
to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common
Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event no more than 10 days after the Closing Date. The Surviving Corporation
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Common Stock to
no longer be quoted on the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

 



 

5.8 _Disclosure_.

 



 

(a) Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or making any other public statement, or scheduling a press
conference or conference call with investors or analysts, with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (a " _Public Disclosure_ ");
_provided, however_ , that, either party may, without consulting the other
party, make a Public Disclosure if (i) such Public Disclosure is consistent
with such partys prior Public Disclosures that were made after consultation
with the other party; or (ii) it is not reasonably practicable to allow the
other party time to comment on such Public Disclosure in advance of such
issuance, solely to the extent such Public Disclosure is required by
applicable Legal Requirement, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or securities
quotation system. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have no obligation
to consult the Company prior to regularly scheduled earnings calls.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to consult
with Parent before issuing any press release or making any other public
statement with respect to an Adverse Change Recommendation effected in
accordance with _Section 5.2(d)_ or _Section 5.2(e)_ or with respect to its
receipt and consideration of any Acquisition Proposal in accordance with
_Section 4.3(f)_. Following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall issue a joint press release acceptable to both
parties.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, no Acquired Corporation shall communicate (and
the Acquired Corporations shall ensure that no Representative of the Acquired
Corporations communicates) with any Company Associate, in each case, regarding
post-Closing employment matters with Parent or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of
Parent, including post-Closing employee benefit plans and compensation, in any
manner that is inconsistent with the terms of employment and related matters
communicated to such Persons by or on behalf of Parent, in each case, without
the prior written approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 



 

5.9 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at or prior to
the Effective Time the resignation, effective as of the Effective Time or, at
the option of Parent, at a later date, of each officer and director of each of
the Acquired Corporations.

 



 

5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such reasonable steps as are required to cause the disposition of Company
Common Stock and Company Options in connection with the Merger, by each
officer or director of the Company who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

the Company, to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

5.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing of, and shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate fully and actively in the defense and settlement,
of any Stockholder Litigation. No compromise or full or partial settlement of
any Stockholder Litigation shall be agreed to by the Company without Parents
prior written consent. Subject to the foregoing, following the Effective Time,
the Indemnified Persons may continue to retain counsel retained prior to the
Effective Time to defend any Stockholder Litigation; _provided, however_ ,
that, in no event shall Parent be required to retain more than one pre-
Effective Time counsel for all the Indemnified Persons as a group, unless
required by conflicts of interest between or among the Indemnified Persons.

 



 

5.12 _Company Debt Payment_. If requested by Parent not less than ten business
days prior to the Closing, the Company shall (i) deliver all notices and take
all other actions reasonably necessary to effect the termination of
commitments and the repayment of all outstanding obligations under the
Existing Credit Facilities and any other existing indebtedness of the Acquired
Corporations and (ii) procure payoff letters in connection with the repayment
and termination of such existing indebtedness in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent. The Company shall request that the payoff letter for
the Existing Credit Facilities shall (A) indicate the total amount required to
be paid to fully satisfy all outstanding and unpaid principal, interest,
breakage costs, fees and other costs and expenses, or similar outstanding and
unpaid obligations related to all indebtedness and other obligations owed
under the Existing Credit Facilities as of the anticipated Closing Date (and
the daily accrual thereafter) (the " _Payoff Amount_ "), (B) state that upon
receipt of the Payoff Amount, the Existing Credit Facilities and related
notes, guaranties, security agreements and other instruments supporting the
repayment of the Existing Credit Facilities shall be terminated (except for
obligations that by the terms of the Existing Credit Facilities survive such
termination), and (C) state that all Liens on the assets of any Acquired
Corporation securing the obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities
shall be, upon the payment by the Company or the Parent of the Payoff Amount
on the Closing Date, released. Prior to or at Closing, the Company shall have
obtained documents, including an authorization to file UCC termination
statements upon payment of the Payoff Amount, as are reasonably necessary to
release all Liens on the assets of any Acquired Corporation securing the
obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities.

 



 

 **Section 6.** **CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT AND MERGER
SUB**

 



 

The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger and otherwise
consummate the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject
to the satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following
conditions:

 



 

6.1 _Accuracy of Representations_.

made as of a specific earlier date, which shall have been accurate in all
respects as of such earlier date) and shall be accurate in all respects as of
the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (other than any such
representation and warranty made as of a specific earlier date, which shall
have been accurate in all respects as of such earlier date), except that any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties will be disregarded if the
circumstances giving rise to all such inaccuracies (considered collectively)
do not constitute, and would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes
of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties as of the
foregoing dates: (i) all Company Material Adverse Effect and materiality
qualifications limiting the scope of such representations and warranties shall
be disregarded; and (ii) any update of or modification to the Company
Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on or after the date
of this Agreement shall be disregarded.

 



 

(b) Each of the Specified Representations, except for the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 2.3(a)_ and _Section
2.3(e)_, shall have been accurate in all material respects as of the date of
this Agreement (other than any such Specified Representation made as of a
specific earlier date, which shall have been accurate in all material respects
as of such earlier date) and shall be accurate in all material respects as of
the Closing Date (other than any such Specified Representation made as of a
specific earlier date, which shall have been accurate as of such earlier
date); _provided, however_ , that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of
such Specified Representation as of the foregoing dates: (i) all Company
Material Adverse Effect and materiality qualifications limiting the scope of
such representations and warranties shall be disregarded; and (ii) any update
of or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or purported to
have been made on or after the date of this Agreement shall be disregarded.

 



 

(c) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section
2.3(a)_ and _Section 2.3(e)_, shall have been accurate in all respects as of
the date of this Agreement (other than any such representation and warranty
made as of a specific earlier date, which shall have been accurate in all
respects as of such earlier date) and shall be accurate in all respects as of
the Closing Date (other than any such representation and warranty made as of a
specific earlier date, which shall have been accurate in all respects as of
such earlier date), except for _de minimus_ inaccuracies.

 



 

6.2 _Performance of Covenants_. All of the covenants and obligations in this
Agreement that the Company is required to comply with or to perform at or
prior to the Closing shall have been complied with and performed in all
material respects.

 



 

6.3 _Stockholder Approval_. This Agreement shall have been duly adopted by the
Requisite Stockholder Approval.

 



      
 

 



 

6.4 _Consents_. All Consents (other than Governmental Authorizations) required
to be made or obtained in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been made or obtained
and shall be in full force and effect, except where the failure to make or
obtain such Consents has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have
or result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

6.5 _Closing Certificate_. Parent shall have received a certificate executed
by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company
confirming that the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ , _6.2_ , _6.3_ ,
_6.4_ , _6.6_ and _6.9_ , have been duly satisfied.

 



 

6.6 _No Company Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date of this Agreement,
there shall not have occurred any Company Material Adverse Effect, and no
event shall have occurred or circumstance shall exist that, in combination
with any other events or circumstances, would reasonably be expected to have
or result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

6.7 _Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(a) (i) The waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under
the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated; and (ii) the Required
Registrations and Consents shall have been made or obtained, as applicable,
and shall remain in full force and effect and all statutory waiting periods
relating to such Required Registrations and Consents shall have expired or
been terminated (in each case, without the imposition of any Burdensome
Condition); _provided, however_ , that any Consent required in a specific
jurisdiction in connection with a change in control of the Acquired
Corporations holding a Money Transmitter License shall not be a condition to
Closing for purposes of this _Section 6.7_ if both (A) an Alternate
Arrangement reasonably acceptable to Parent shall have been implemented in
such jurisdiction, and (B) as a result of the implementation of such Alternate
Arrangement in such jurisdiction, the failure to obtain the applicable Consent
with respect to such Money Transmitter License in such jurisdiction and the
continued conduct of the operations of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and its Subsidiaries on the basis of the Alternate Arrangements in such
jurisdiction shall not reasonably be expected to be a violation of applicable
Legal Requirements. For purposes of this _Section 6.7(a)_, " _Required
Registrations and Consents_ " means any Consent or other registration,
declaration, notice or filing related to Money Transmitter Licenses (each, a "
_Registration_ ") with any Governmental Body listed on _Schedule 6.7(a)_ and
all other Registrations and Consents in each case required to be made or
obtained prior to the Closing, except for such other Registrations or Consents
not listed on _Schedule 6.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule the
failure of which to be obtained or made prior to the Closing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Any waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under any
applicable foreign antitrust or competition law or regulation shall have
expired or been terminated.

 



 

(c) Any Governmental Authorization or other Consent required to be obtained
under any applicable antitrust or competition law or regulation shall have
been obtained and shall remain in full force and effect.

 



      
 

 



 

6.8 _No Restraints_. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other Order preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have
been issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body
and remain in effect, and there shall not be any Legal Requirement enacted or
deemed applicable to the Merger that makes consummation of the Merger illegal.

writing any Legal Proceeding in which a Governmental Body is, or is threatened
to, become a party or is otherwise involved, and neither Parent nor the
Company shall have received any communication from any Governmental Body in

Legal Proceeding or taking any other action: (a) challenging or seeking to
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or any of the other

of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and seeking to obtain

as if made on and as of the Closing Date (other than any representation and
warranty made as of a specific earlier date, which shall have been accurate in
all material respects as of such earlier date), except where the failure of
the representations and warranties of the Parent Companies to be accurate
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Parent to consummate the Merger; _provided, however_ , that, for
purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties as
of the foregoing dates, all materiality qualifications limiting the scope of
such representations and warranties shall be disregarded.

Agreement that Parent and Merger Sub are required to comply with or to perform

7.6 _No Restraints_. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent

 **Section 8.** **TERMINATION**

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Effective
Time (whether before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite
Stockholder Approval) by written notice of the terminating party (acting
through such partys board of directors or its designee) to the other parties:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

(b) by Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated
before 5:00 p.m. prevailing Pacific Time on the date that is six months
following the date of this Agreement (the " _End Date_ "); _provided, however_
, that if, by the third business day prior to the End Date, (i) the conditions
set forth in _Section 6.7_, _Section 6.8_ (with regard to matters pertaining
to the HSR Act or any applicable foreign antitrust or competition laws),
_Section 6.9_ (with regard to matters pertaining to the HSR Act or any
applicable foreign antitrust or competition laws), _Section 7.5_ or _Section
7.6_ (with regard to matters pertaining to the HSR Act or any applicable
foreign antitrust or competition laws) (collectively, the " _Regulatory
Conditions_ ") have not been satisfied and all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7_ have been satisfied or duly waived by the Company (other than
those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing
Date but which would be capable of being satisfied if the Closing occurred on
the End Date), Parent may, by written notice delivered to the Company, extend
the End Date to a date that is 60 days following the End Date (any extension
pursuant to this clause "(i)" or by clause "(ii)", the " _Extended End Date_
") and, if the conditions in this clause "(i)" continue to apply as of the
Extended End Date, Parent may further extend the Extended End Date to a date
that is 60 days following the initial Extended End Date, with any further
extensions beyond the aggregate 120-day extension to be mutually agreed by
Parent and the Company (the last extended End Date pursuant to this clause
"(i)" or by clause "(ii)", the " _Final End Date_ "); and (ii) the Regulatory
Conditions have not been satisfied and all of the other conditions set forth
in _Section 6_ have been satisfied or duly waived by Parent (other than those
conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date but
which would be capable of being satisfied if the Closing occurred on the End
Date), the Company may, by

 



      
 

 



 

written notice delivered to Parent, extend the End Date to a date that is 60
days following the End Date and, if the conditions in this clause "(ii)"
continue to apply as of the Extended End Date, the Company may further extend
the Extended End Date to a date that is 60 days following the initial Extended
End Date, with any further extensions beyond the aggregate 120-day extension
to be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no party shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(b)_ if the failure to consummate the Merger by the End
Date, the Extended End Date or the Final End Date, as applicable, is
attributable to a failure on the part of such party to perform any covenant or
obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such party at or
prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(c) by Parent or the Company if a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Body shall have issued a final and nonappealable Order having the
effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party whose
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the issuance,
promulgation, enforcement or entry of any such Order;

 



 

(d) by Parent or the Company if: (i) the Company Stockholders Meeting
(including any adjournments and postponements thereof) shall have been held
and completed and the Companys stockholders shall have taken a final vote on
a proposal to adopt this Agreement; and (ii) this Agreement shall not have
been adopted at the Company Stockholders Meeting (and shall not have been
adopted at any adjournment or postponement thereof) by the Requisite
Stockholder Approval; _provided, however_ , that: a party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if
the failure to have this Agreement adopted by the Requisite Stockholder
Approval is attributable to a failure on the part of such party to perform any
covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such
party at or prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(e) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Requisite Stockholder Approval) if a Triggering Event shall have occurred;

 



 

(f) by the Company (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Requisite Stockholder Approval), in order to accept a Superior Offer and enter
into a Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement relating to such Superior
Offer, if: (i) such Superior Offer shall not have resulted from any breach of
_Section 4.3_ or _Section 5.2_, (ii) the Company Board, after satisfying all
of the applicable requirements set forth in _Section 5.2(d)_, shall have
authorized the Company to enter into a Specified Definitive Acquisition
Agreement and (iii) the Company enters into the Specified Definitive
Acquisition Agreement and pays the Designated Amount as provided in _Section
8.3(c)_ concurrently with the termination of this Agreement (it being
understood that this Agreement may not be terminated by the Company unless and
until any fee required to be paid by the Company at the time of such
termination pursuant to _Section 8.3_ shall have been paid and made in full);

 



 

(g) by Parent if: (i) any of the Companys representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of this
Agreement, or

 



      
 

 



 

shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) such that the condition set
forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ or _Section 6.1(b)_ would not be satisfied (it
being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such
representations or warranties as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
subsequent date: (A) all materiality qualifications limiting the scope of such
representations or warranties shall be disregarded; and (B) any update of or
modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been
made on or after the date of this Agreement shall be disregarded); or (ii) any
of the Companys covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement shall
have been breached such that the condition set forth in _Section 6.2_ would
not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of clauses "(i)"
and "(ii)" of this sentence, if an inaccuracy in any of the Companys
representations or warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement or a breach of a covenant or obligation by the Company is curable by
the Company prior to the End Date and the Company is continuing to exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then Parent
may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(g)_ on account of
such inaccuracy or breach unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain
uncured for a period of 30 days commencing on the date that Parent gives the
Company notice of such inaccuracy or breach; _provided further, however_ ,
that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(g)_ if either Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub is in breach of its
obligations under this Agreement such that the Company would be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_; or

 



 

(h) by the Company if: (i) any of Parents representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ would not be
satisfied (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy
of such representations or warranties as of the date of this Agreement or as
of any subsequent date, all materiality qualifications limiting the scope of
such representations or warranties shall be disregarded); or (ii) any of
Parents covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement shall have been
breached such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ would not be
satisfied; _provided, however_ , that if an inaccuracy in any of Parents
representations or warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement or a breach of a covenant or obligation by Parent is curable by
Parent by the End Date and Parent is continuing to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(h)_ on account of such
inaccuracy or breach unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for
a period of 30 days commencing on the date that the Company gives Parent
notice of such inaccuracy or breach; _provided further, however_ , that the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(h)_ if the Company is in breach of its obligations under this
Agreement such that Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in _Section 8.1_ this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect without liability of any party to each other party hereto; _provided,
however_ , that: (i) this _Section 8.2_, the last sentence of _Section 4.1_,
_Section 8.3_ and _Section 9_ and the applicable definitions in _Exhibit A_
or elsewhere in this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and shall remain in full force and effect; and (ii) the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
knowing or intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement delivered in connection herewith or any fraud.

 



 

8.3 _Expenses; Termination Fees_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent shall pay all fees and expenses, other than attorneys fees,
incurred in connection with the filing by the parties hereto of the premerger
notification and report forms relating to the Merger under the HSR Act and the
filing of any notice or other document under any applicable foreign antitrust
or competition law or regulation.

 



 

(b) If: (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_ (but only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited
from terminating the Agreement pursuant to the last sentence of _Section
8.1(b)_) or _Section 8.1(d)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_; (ii)
at or prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been disclosed publicly, announced, commenced, submitted
or otherwise made and not irrevocably publicly withdrawn at least five
business days prior to the termination of this Agreement (in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_) or at least
five business days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (in the case of
a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_); and (iii) within 12 months after
the date of any such termination, an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not
relating to such Acquisition Proposal) is consummated or a definitive
agreement contemplating an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not relating to
such Acquisition Proposal) is executed ( _provided that_ , for purposes of
this _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_, all percentages in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be replaced with 50%), then the Company shall pay to Parent, in
cash, a non-refundable fee in an amount equal to the Designated Amount (as
defined in _Section 8.3(d)_ below).

 



 

(c) If: (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_, or by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ at any time
after the occurrence of a Triggering Event; or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_, then the Company
shall pay to Parent, in cash, a non-refundable fee in an amount equal to the
Designated Amount.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this _Section 8.3_, the " _Designated Amount_ " shall be
$29,919,618.

 



 

(e) Any fee required to be paid to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.3(b) _shall

(f) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and obligations
contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these covenants and obligations, Parent would not have entered into
this Agreement.

 



 

(g) If the Company fails to pay when due any amount payable under this
_Section 8.3_, then: (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and
expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection
with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by Parent of
its rights under this _Section 8.3_; and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent
interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such

(b) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy.

 



 

(c) No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
unless the

 



      
 

 



 

waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth
in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party;
and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the
specific instance in which it is given.

 



 

9.3 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the

(including the Company Disclosure Schedule) and _Section 3_ of this Agreement
and any certificate or schedule delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (i)
neither the Company, Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub makes any other
representations or warranties and each hereby disclaims any other
representations or warranties made by itself or any of its Representatives,
with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, notwithstanding
the delivery or disclosure to any other party or any other partys
Representatives of any document or other information with respect to any one
or more of the foregoing and (ii) none of the other parties makes or has made
any representation or warranty with respect to any projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans or budgets relating to the future business or financial
performance of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or
hereafter delivered to or made available to the other parties. This Agreement
may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The
exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
facsimile or by electronic delivery shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

9.5 _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement shall
be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action between any
of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties:
(a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in

jurisdiction over the matter, in which case each of the parties irrevocably
and unconditionally consents and submits to the jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware); (b) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from such court; and (c) agrees that it will not bring any such action
in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and

jurisdiction over the matter, in which case each of the parties agrees that it
will not bring such action in any court other than the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware). Service of any process, summons, notice
or document to any partys address and in the manner set forth in _Section
9.9_ shall be effective service of process for any such action.

 



      
 

 



 

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES, AGREES AND CERTIFIES
THAT: (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD, IN THE EVENT

UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS

THIS _SECTION 9.5_.

 



 

9.6 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged in separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections
contained in _Section 2_, and the information disclosed in any numbered or
lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the particular
representation or warranty set forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered
section in _Section 2_, and shall not be deemed to relate to or to qualify
any other representation or warranty, except where it is reasonably apparent
from the wording of such exception or disclosure that such exception or
disclosure is intended to qualify such representation or warranty. The
inclusion of any matter or event in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not
be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms of the Agreement to be disclosed, is
material to the Acquired Corporations, whether considered individually or in
combination with other matters or events disclosed herein, has resulted in or
would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the ordinary
course of business. The information set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no
information set forth therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever, including any violation of
law or breach of any Contract. The information in the Company Disclosure
Schedule is disclosed confidentially, and Parent and Merger Sub agree by their
receipt of the Company Disclosure Schedule that such information shall be held
subject to the obligations of the Confidentiality Agreement. In disclosing
the information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
expressly does not waive any attorney-client privilege associated with any
such information or any protection afforded by the "work product doctrine"
with respect to any of the matters disclosed herein.

 



 

9.7 _Attorneys  Fees_. In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce this
Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing party
in such action or suit shall be entitled to receive its reasonable attorneys

suit.

 



 

9.8 _Assignability_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however_ , that
neither this Agreement nor any of a partys rights, interests or obligations
hereunder may be assigned or delegated by such party, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other

 



      
 

 



 

parties, and any attempted assignment or delegation of this Agreement or any
of such rights, interests or obligations by such party without the other
parties prior written consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided
further_ , that Merger Sub may assign in its sole discretion and without the
consent of any other party, all (but not less than all) of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, provided such Subsidiary of Parent is a
Delaware corporation and that such assignment shall not impair, delay or
prevent the consummation of the Merger, but no such assignment shall relieve
Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding
sentence and except as specifically provided in _Section 5.5_, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of the Indemnified
Persons under _Section 5.5_ shall not arise unless and until the Effective
Time occurs.
