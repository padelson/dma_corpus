of the FBCA, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall
make any and all other filings or recordings required under the FBCA. The
Merger shall become effective on the date and at the time the Articles of
Merger have been duly filed pursuant to the FBCA with the Florida Department
of State or at such later date and time as Parent and Company shall agree in
writing and shall specify in the Articles of Merger, provided that such date
and time shall be on or after the time of filing of the Articles of Merger and

as so amended shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions
thereof and applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of

Surviving Corporation shall be "PSS World Medical, Inc.", and as so amended
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with the provisions thereof, the articles of incorporation of

virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of Company, Parent,
or Merger Sub:

 

(a) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Company (such
shares, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled or to remain
outstanding in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_) shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
$29.00 in cash payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax;

 

(b) each Share held by Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; _provided_ that, for
the avoidance of doubt, each Share that is owned by a direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Company shall remain outstanding; and 

(c) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Company, or securities convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of the capital stock of Company, respectively, shall occur as a result
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date
during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, if
necessary and without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ , _that_
nothing in this sentence shall be construed to permit Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement, including _Section 5.1_.

 



3 Section 2.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, at the Effective
Time, each option or similar right (each, a " _Stock Option_ ") to purchase
Shares granted under any stock option, stock purchase, director compensation
or other equity compensation plan, arrangement or agreement of Company, other
than the PSS World Medical Employee Stock Purchase Plan (" _Company ESPP_ ")
(the " _Company Equity Plans_ "), or otherwise, whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares
subject to such Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the
per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share subject to
such Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to
be rounded to the nearest cent), less the amount of any required withholding
Tax (the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Option Consideration shall be paid
as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and in no
event later than 10 Business Days after the Effective Time). No holder of a
Stock Option that has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater
than the per Share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any payment with
respect to such cancelled Stock Option before or after the Effective Time.
Payment of any cash amounts to be paid pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_
shall be made through Companys (or the Surviving Corporations) payroll.

(b) Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, at the Effective
Time, each Share subject to restrictions on transfer and/or forfeiture granted
under a Company Equity Plan or otherwise (the " _Restricted Stock_ "), that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully
vested and all restrictions on transfer and/or forfeiture shall lapse as of
the Effective Time, and shall thereafter represent the unrestricted right to
receive the Merger Consideration, less the amount of any required
withholding Tax.

(c) Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, at the Effective
Time, each restricted stock unit, deferred stock unit and each common stock
equivalent unit granted under a Company Equity Plan, whether time-vesting,
performance-based or in the nature of deferred compensation (each, a " _Stock
Unit_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall become fully vested (based on an assumed
attainment of performance goals at "target" level in the case of performance-
based awards) and each such vested Stock Unit shall cease to represent a
right to receive a Share of Companys common stock, and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
per Share Merger Consideration, less the amount of any required
withholding Tax (the " _Stock Unit Consideration_ "). The Stock Unit
Consideration shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time (and in no event later than 10 Business Days after the
Effective Time). Payment of any cash amounts to be paid pursuant to this
_Section 2.2(c)_ shall be made through Companys (or the Surviving
Corporations) payroll.

 



4 (d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement but in no
event later than the last day of the monthly Offering (as such term is
defined in the Company ESPP) during which the date of this Agreement occurs,
Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that (i) the Company ESPP,
and all options or other rights to purchase Shares under the Company ESPP,
shall be terminated immediately following the completion of such monthly
Offering (the " _Final Purchase Date_ "), (ii) funds credited to each
participants payroll withholding account under the Company ESPP as of the
Final Purchase Date shall be applied to the purchase of whole Shares in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP (and any amount remaining in
such account shall be returned to such participant), which shares shall be
treated in the manner described in _Section 2.1(a)_ subject to and upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time, and (iii) that no further Offerings shall
commence from and after the date hereof.

 

(e) Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, (i) the Company Equity Plans shall terminate and (ii) no
holder of Stock Options, Restricted Stock or Stock Units and no participant in
any Company Equity Plan or any other employee incentive or benefit plan,
program or arrangement or any non-employee director plan maintained by
Company shall have any rights to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the
capital stock of Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries, except the rights contemplated by _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2(a)_ ,
_(b)_ ,  _(c)_ and _(d)_.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Company Equity Plans or Company ESPP) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
transactions described in clauses (a) through (d) of this Section.

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall, in consultation with Parent,
deliver all required notices to each holder of Stock Options, Restricted
Stock, Stock Units or any participant in the Company Equity Plans or Company
ESPP, setting forth each holders or participants rights pursuant to the
applicable Company Equity Plan or Company ESPP, as applicable, and stating
that such Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Stock Units or any rights pursuant
to such Company Equity Plan or Company ESPP, as applicable, shall be treated
in the manner set forth in this _Section 2.2_.

 

Section 2.3 _Exchange and Payment for Shares_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall enter into an agreement (in a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent) with a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Parent to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment
of the Merger Consideration to which the shareholders of Company shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1_. At or promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in
an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration. The cash deposited with
the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_ shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to _Sections 2.1(a)_ or
_2.4_.

 



5 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) an outstanding
certificate (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares or (ii) uncertificated Shares recorded on the
books of Company and represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
which, in each case, were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by such Person shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, and shall contain such other provisions as Parent or the Paying
Agent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, payable with respect thereto pursuant to _Sections 2.1(a)_.
Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed,
and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to promptly pay,
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax), and such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. In the event payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, or the transfer
of such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred, and that the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or shall establish to the satisfaction
of Parent and the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender or
transfer, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, pursuant
to _Section 2.1(a)_, without any interest thereon.

(c) At the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-
Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

(d) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ ,  _that_ no such investment
or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares entitled to receive such consideration, and
Parent shall promptly provide 

 



6  additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in the amount of any such losses to the
extent necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration. Any interest or
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, upon demand, as Parent directs.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of
the Merger Consideration with respect to Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, without interest.

 

(f) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if determined by Parent in its sole discretion, the posting by
such Person of a bond in customary amount and on customary terms as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for
such affidavit regarding such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares,
Stock Options, Restricted Stock or Stock Units or otherwise pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law. The Paying Agent shall remit any such deducted and withheld amounts
to the Surviving Corporation for payment by the Surviving Corporation to the
appropriate taxing authority, and such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

knowledge of Company, by any Governmental Entity, with respect to Companys
stock option granting practices or other equity compensation practices.
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all Company
Equity Plans and the forms of all award agreements evidencing outstanding

Minority Interest Businesses, Company does not own, directly or indirectly,
any equity, membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest,

issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject to any preemptive
rights. All of the shares of capital stock or other voting securities or
equity interests of each Subsidiary or Company Minority Interest Business that
are owned, directly or indirectly, by Company are owned, directly or
indirectly, by Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims,
liens, charges, options, rights of first refusal, encumbrances and security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (including any limitation on
voting, sale, transfer or other disposition or exercise of any other attribute
of ownership) (collectively, " _Liens_ ") other than restrictions on transfer
under applicable securities Laws. No Subsidiary is party to any Contracts with
respect to the voting (including voting trusts and proxies) or sale or

acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) in

Bylaws and the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational or governing documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
except for the Convertible Note Hedge, the Warrant, the Indentures and the

the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

(a) Company and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished on a timely basis
with the SEC, all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by them with the SEC since April 2, 2010

businesses of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted other
than Intellectual Property owned by a third party that is licensed to Company
or a Subsidiary thereof pursuant to an existing license agreement and used by
Company or such Subsidiary within the scope of such license. The immediately
foregoing sentence in this _Section 3.20(b)_ shall not be interpreted as a
separate representation or warranty in addition to _Section 3.20(c)_ that (A)
the Intellectual Property owned by Company or its Subsidiaries, or its use or
exploitation in any manner by Company or its Subsidiaries and their customers,
licensees and end-users, does not or shall not infringe any Intellectual
Property of any Person or (B) in the operation of its or their businesses as

businesses as currently conducted. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice or claim asserting or suggesting
that any such infringement, misappropriation, or dilution is or may be
occurring or has or may have occurred, except where any such infringement,
misappropriation or dilution, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of
Company, no third party is misappropriating, infringing, or diluting any
Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except where any such infringement, misappropriation or
dilution, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected

any outstanding order, judgment, decree or stipulation restricting or limiting
in any material respect the use or licensing thereof by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not

Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable efforts to protect the

Agreement or by any Law or the terms of any Material Contract to which Company

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not
authorize or permit any Representatives of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage,
cooperate in any with, assist or take any other action (including taking any
affirmative action to exempt or cause to be inapplicable as to any individual
or entity (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) the provisions of Section
607.0901 or Section 607.0902 of the FBCA or any other analogous state Takeover
Law) designed to result in or facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with
respect to, or the announcement, making or completion of, any Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that may reasonably be expected to
lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person other
than Parent, Merger Sub or any Representatives of the foregoing Persons, any
non-public information or data (relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or otherwise) with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, assist or facilitate any Person that is seeking to
make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) approve, recommend,
declare advisable or enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, letter of
intent, term sheet or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or requiring Company to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations
hereunder or fail to consummate the Merger. Company shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Representatives of Company and its Subsidiaries to, (A)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing negotiations,
discussions or activities with any Person and its Representatives (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives) conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) request the prompt return or
destruction, to the extent required by any confidentiality agreement, of all
confidential information previously furnished to any such Person and its
Representatives, and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any
provision of any standstill agreement (including any standstill provisions
contained in any confidentiality or other agreement) to which it or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives is a party, unless, solely with respect to this
clause (C), the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel) that such action would be reasonably likely to result in

 



37  a breach of its fiduciary duties under Florida Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Shareholder Approval, (1) Company receives a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith to be bona
fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a material violation
of this _Section 5.2(a)_, (3) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, and (4) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take the actions
referred to in the following clause (x) or (y) would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Florida Law, then Company may (and may authorize its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to): (x) furnish non-public
information with respect to Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to
Parent, which copy may at Companys election be redacted to exclude the
identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal), _provided_ , _that_
any non-public information provided to any Person given such access shall
have previously been provided to Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior
to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person; and (y)
participate in negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
(and such Persons Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

(b) The Company Board (i)(A) shall not fail to make and shall not withdraw
(or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or publicly propose to
withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent) the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) shall not adopt, approve, or
publicly recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of
any Acquisition Proposal (each such action set forth in this _Section
5.2(b)(i)_ being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ")
and (ii) shall not cause or permit Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any definitive acquisition agreement, merger agreement, share
exchange agreement, consolidation agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or similar agreement (each, an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to _Section
5.2(a)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, and
only following compliance with _Section 5.2(c)_ and _Section 5.2(d)_, the
Company Board may, if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Florida Law, (i) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change (A) in response to a bona fide written unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof or (B) in response to an
Intervening Event or (ii) cause or permit Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and promptly thereafter enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (a "
_Superior Proposal Termination_ "); _provided_ , that no Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made in response to an Acquisition Proposal and
Company may not terminate this Agreement in order to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, unless the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors)
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 



38 (c) Prior to effecting any Adverse Recommendation Change or Superior Proposal
Termination, (1) Company shall notify Parent in writing, at least three
Business Days prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or
Superior Proposal Termination (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to
effect such Adverse Recommendation Change or Superior Proposal Termination
(which notice shall include the material terms and conditions of any Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person making such proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice Period of at least two Business
Days), or, if in a response to an Intervening Event, shall include reasonable
detail regarding the Intervening Event, (2) during the applicable Notice
Period, Company shall negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that the Superior Proposal ceases to be a
Superior Proposal or the Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the
Intervening Event is no longer necessary, as applicable, and (3) at the end of
the Notice Period, the Company Board shall determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such
Superior Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent) or the Intervening Event continues to
necessitate an Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable.

(d) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in _Sections
5.2(a),_ _(b)_ and _(c)_ , Company promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) shall advise Parent in writing in the event that after the date hereof
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for non-public information or to
engage in negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or that
contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, in each case together with the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or request, other
than the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or
request. Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects of the status (including after the occurrence of any material
amendment or modification) of any such Acquisition Proposal or request.
Without limiting any of the foregoing, Company shall promptly notify Parent if
Company determines to begin providing non-public information or to engage in
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Sections 5.2(a)_
or _(b)_ and shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging
in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this _Section 5.2_ to the
contrary, Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of any Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (A) if Company (or any of its Subsidiaries
or its or their Representatives) (x) continues to make available non-public
information with respect to Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal (or such Persons Representatives) for a period of
more than five Business Days following the date on which an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement was entered into with such Person or (y)
participates in negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal with the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal (or such Persons Representatives)
and (B) at least five Business Days prior to commencing any Notice Period with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal.

 



39 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit Company or the
Company Board from (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) taking and disclosing a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act, 
_provided_ , _that_ any such action taken or disclosure made that relates to
an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in
connection with such action or disclosure, or (iii) making any required
disclosure to the shareholders of Company if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel), failure to so
disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Florida Law;
_provided_ , _that_ in no event shall this _Section 5.2(e)_ affect the
obligations of Company specified in _Sections 5.2(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ ; and
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that a "stop, look and listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal, offer, indication of
interest or inquiry from any Person or group of Persons (other than Parent and
its Affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition, purchase,
license or lease, in one transaction or a series of transactions, including
any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, tender offer, self-
tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or
similar transaction, (A) of assets or businesses of Company and its
Subsidiaries that generate 20% or more of the net revenues or net income or
that represent 20% or more of the consolidated assets (based on fair market
value), of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior
to such transaction, (B) of 20% or more of any class of capital stock, other
equity security or voting power of Company or any resulting parent company of
Company or any of Companys Subsidiaries whose revenues, net income or assets,
individually or in the aggregate, represent 20% or more of the consolidated
assets (based on fair market value) of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, immediately prior to such transaction or (C) involving businesses of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, individually or taken together, which
businesses constitute 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or
consolidated assets (based on fair market value) of Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, in each
case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that any proposal, offer,
indication of interest or inquiry from any Person or group of Persons (other
than Parent and its Affiliates) primarily with respect to any direct or
indirect acquisition, purchase, license or lease, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, including any merger, reorganization, consolidation,
share exchange, tender offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition,
asset acquisition, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction, of the assets or business
of, or equity interests in, Gulf South Medical Supply, Inc. (such proposal,
offer, indication of interest or inquiry, a " _Gulf South Transaction
Proposal_ ") shall constitute an Acquisition Proposal hereunder.

 



40 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal made after the date hereof (with all percentages included in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" increased to 50%) that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
financial advisors), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects and risks of the proposal (including required conditions,
including any requirement of a shareholder vote of the Person making the
proposal, or financing requirements) and the Person making the proposal, (A)
would be more favorable to the shareholders of Company from a financial point
of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any
adjustment to the terms and conditions thereof proposed in writing by Parent
in response to any such Acquisition Proposal) and (B) if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis. For
the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that a Gulf South
Transaction Proposal cannot constitute a Superior Proposal hereunder.

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a fact, change, development, event or
circumstance that was not known to the Company Board on the date of this
Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not known to or
reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date hereof), which
event or circumstance, or any material consequences thereof, becomes known to
the Company Board prior to the time at which Company obtains the Shareholder
Approval and does not relate to any (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any
events or circumstances relating to the Merger, the transactions contemplated
hereby or Parent.

Section 5.3 _Proxy Statement; Shareholders  Meeting_.

(a) Company shall (i) as soon as reasonably practicable following the
execution of this Agreement (but in no event later than 15 Business Days
after the date of this Agreement), prepare and file with the SEC, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have cleared by the SEC and thereafter mail
to its shareholders the Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials
required in connection with the Shareholders Meeting, (ii) notify Parent and
Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent and
Merger Sub copies of all correspondence between Company or any of its
Representatives and the SEC, (iii) give Parent and Merger Sub and their
counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy Statement prior to its being
filed with the SEC and give Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel the
opportunity to review all amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement
and all responses to requests for additional information and replies to
comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC (and, in each
such case, give reasonable consideration to any comments made by Parent or its
Representatives), (iv) subject to  _Section 5.3(b)_ and the right of Company
to terminate this Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Shareholder Approval and (v) set
a record date for the Shareholders Meeting as early as

 



41  practicable following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC or a
determination by the SEC not to review the Proxy Statement and otherwise to
comply with all legal requirements applicable to the Shareholders Meeting.
Parent and Merger Sub will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Company all information reasonably requested by Company for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Company or Parent, or any of their respective directors or
officers, become known by Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of Company. 

(b) Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, take all action necessary in accordance with Florida Law and the
Company Charter and the Company Bylaws to (i) duly call, give notice of,
convene and (ii) hold a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Shareholders
Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable following clearance by the
SEC of the Proxy Statement solely for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder
Approval. Except in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically
permitted by _Section 5.2(b)_, Company, through the Company Board, shall (x)
recommend to Companys shareholders that they adopt this Agreement and (y)
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to
the first sentence of this _Section 5.3(b)_ shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Company
or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of
any Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _that_ the foregoing shall
not prohibit (i) Company, if it has complied with the provisions of _Section
5.2_ and this _Section 5.3_, from delaying the holding of the Shareholders
Meeting, for such time as is necessary for the Company Board to consider the
possible need for an Adverse Recommendation Change (and no such delay shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change), but only in the event that,
and only to the extent that, the Company Board (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) has determined that the failure to so delay would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Florida Law (ii) accurate disclosure in the Proxy Statement or otherwise (and
no such disclosure shall, in and of itself, be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change) of factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Company or the fact that an
Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the Person making such
proposal or the material terms of such proposal to the extent the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that such information, facts, identity or terms are required to be disclosed
under applicable Law.

 



42 Section 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, during the
period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, to
all their respective properties, assets, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, Company shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent: (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed, furnished or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities Laws and which is not generally available on the EDGAR
internet database and (ii) all other information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request (including all work papers of its auditors and all Tax Returns filed
and those in preparation); _provided_ , _that_ no investigation conducted, or
any reports, analyses or other information provided, pursuant to this
_Section 5.4_ shall affect or be deemed to modify, limit or supplement any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein; _provided_ , _further_
, that neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would, in the reasonable judgment of such party, (A) materially breach any
material agreement with any third party, (B) constitute a waiver of the
attorney-client or other privilege held by such party or (C) otherwise violate
any applicable Law. In the event any of the restrictions in clauses (A)
through (C) of the foregoing sentence shall apply, the parties will
make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting
additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive
material and to ensure compliance with applicable Laws. If any of the
information or material furnished pursuant to this _Section 5.4(a)_ includes
materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each party
understands and agrees that the parties have a commonality of interest with
respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual
understanding of the parties that the sharing of such material or
information is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way
the confidentiality of such material or information or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information provided by Company that is
entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such
protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint
defense doctrine.

(b) All such information shall be held confidential in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and Company, dated as
of July 26, 2012, as amended (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ or information provided,
made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement (other than
the Company Disclosure Letter) shall affect any of the representations or
warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 



43 Section 5.5 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including _Section 5.5(b)_), each of the parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party
in doing, all things that are necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, including using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish
the following: (i) obtain all required consents, approvals or waivers from
third parties, including under any Material Contract as may be necessary in
order to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby

approvals or waivers from third parties under any other Contract if the
parties determine that doing so is necessary or desirable in connection with
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), (ii) obtain all required actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities,
make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings and take all

any Action by, any Governmental Entity, including filings under the HSR Act
with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice within the time periods specified
thereunder (or, if such time period is not specified, within a reasonable

Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, the parties shall make
such filing within 10 Business Days of the date hereof, unless otherwise
agreed to by the parties), (iii) resist, contest or defend any Action
(including administrative or judicial Actions) challenging the Merger or the

and that could restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including by pursuing avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal, and (iv) execute and deliver any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and fully to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the other party. Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to each other party
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law
relating to the exchange of information, Parent and Company shall have the
right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall consult
with the other in connection with, all of the information relating to Parent
or Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of Parent and Company shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other

44  Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or third party with respect to
such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the circumstances,
shall consult with the other party in advance of, and provide the other party
and its counsel with the opportunity to attend and participate in, any meeting
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby at which
substantive matters are to be discussed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
will determine strategy, lead all proceedings and coordinate all activities
with respect to seeking any actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any
Governmental Entity or third party as contemplated hereby, and Company and its
Subsidiaries will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions
as reasonably requested by Parent in connection with obtaining any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers; _provided_ that Parent will in good
faith consider any views or input provided by Company with respect to such
matters.

 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, propose, negotiate,
offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and
effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or other agreement, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or effective as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or
offer to commit to take any action (including any action that limits its
freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to
retain or hold, any of the businesses, assets, product lines, properties or
services of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries) which it is lawfully capable of taking and if the offer is
accepted, take or commit to take such action, in each case as may be required
so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (any of the
foregoing, a " _Divestiture Action_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything contained in this Agreement that may be to the contrary, (1) neither
Parent nor Company shall be required to take any Divestiture Action that is
not conditioned upon consummation of the Merger, (2) Company shall not agree
to take any Divestiture Action without the consent of Parent, (3) none of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or accept (or
commit to take or accept) any action, condition, restriction, obligation or
requirement (each of the foregoing, for the purposes of this Section,
an "action") in order to obtain any approval, exemption or other
authorization of a Governmental Entity involving any business or asset of
Parent or its Subsidiaries that would otherwise be required by this _Section
5.5_ unless there is no action (including a Divestiture Action) that would
permit such approval, exemption or other authorization of a Governmental
Entity to be obtained that involves solely businesses or assets of Company and
its Subsidiaries and to which Parent is required by this _Section 5.5_, or
is otherwise willing in Parents sole discretion, to agree and (4) Parent
shall not be required to take (pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ or any other
provision of this Agreement) any action (including a Divestiture Action) to
the extent such action (including a Divestiture Action), individually or in
the aggregate with all other actions (including Divestiture Actions), would
reasonably be expected to result in a Substantial Detriment. " _Substantial
Detriment_ " means (i) any material limitation, restriction or prohibition on
the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries effectively to acquire, hold
or exercise full rights of ownership (including with respect to voting) of
the Shares or shares of the Surviving Corporation to be acquired or owned
pursuant to the

 



45  Merger or the assets of Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) a loss by Parent
and its Subsidiaries of a material benefit or material benefits (including
synergies), after taking into account the adverse effect of the proposed
actions on Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, for these purposes, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), arising from or relating to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) an
impact that is adverse in a material manner to the assets, business, results
of operation or financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries, assuming
for purposes of this determination that Parent and its Subsidiaries are of
equivalent size to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole or (iv) an impact that is adverse in a material manner to the assets,
business, results of operation or financial condition of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

(c) Neither Parent nor Company shall, and each of them shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with
or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or
equity in, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other
business organization or division thereof, in each case, that operate in the
specific industries in which Company and its Subsidiaries operate, if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of
such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to:
(i) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) materially increase the risk of
not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iii)
otherwise prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.6 _Takeover Laws_. Each of Company and Parent and their respective
Boards of Directors shall (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure no
Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if any Takeover Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable consistent with applicable Law on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Takeover Law with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication would reasonably be expected to be material to Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relates to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby, or (c) any change, condition or
event (i) that renders or would reasonably be expected to render
any representation or warranty of such

 



46  party set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate to an extent
such that the condition set forth in _Sections 6.2(a)_ or _6.3(a)_ , as
applicable, would not be satisfied if the Closing were to then occur or (ii)
that results or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement (including any condition set forth in Article VI) to
be complied with or satisfied by such party hereunder; _provided_ , _that_ no
such notification, nor any failure to make such notification, shall affect any
of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

Section 5.8 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume and perform all rights to indemnification existing in

Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement (and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause its Subsidiaries to assume and perform all such rights
to the current and former directors and officers of such Subsidiaries
as provided in the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of each such Subsidiary as applicable to such
persons as in effect on the date of this Agreement) for (i) the fact that such
person is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) matters, acts or omissions
arising, existing or occurring prior to and through the Effective Time
(including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), and
such rights shall continue in full force and effect until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such
directors and officers arising out of such matters, acts or omissions, except
as otherwise required by applicable Law, and to include and cause to be
maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporations (or any successors)
articles of incorporation (or in the case of the Surviving Corporations
Subsidiaries, the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of each such Subsidiary), for a period of six years
after the Effective Time, the current provisions regarding elimination of
liability of directors.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering each Person currently
covered by Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
(correct and complete copies of which have been heretofore made available to
Parent) for acts or omissions occurring prior to and through the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that in lieu of such obligation, (i) Parent or the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of an insurance company
with the same or better rating as Companys current insurance carrier the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable
in any material respect to such directors and officers than Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof or (ii) in consultation with Parent, Company
may obtain extended reporting period coverage under Companys existing
insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time) for a

 



47  period of six years after the Effective Time for a cost not in excess of
three times the current annual premiums for such insurance; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this _Section 5.8(b)_ in
excess of 300% of the most recent annual premiums paid by Company for such
purpose (which premiums are hereby represented and warranted by Company to be
as set forth in _Section 5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter_), it being
understood that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated
to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount.

(c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successor and assign of the Surviving
Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.8_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.
The rights of the current and former directors and officers of Company
hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights
such persons may have under the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other
organization or governing documents of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the FBCA or
otherwise. Subsequent amendment of the articles of incorporation, bylaws or
other organizational or governing documents of the Surviving Corporation shall
not diminish or impair the rights of any such current or former directors and
officers.

Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ "), (i) maintain the annual
cash compensation opportunity of such Continuing Employees that is
substantially comparable to that in effect prior to the Effective Time
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity-based incentives), (ii)
continue to maintain the Benefit Plans that provide severance benefits,
401(k), and health and welfare benefits to Continuing Employees prior to the
Effective Time, or, in the sole discretion of Parent, provide such benefits
under employee benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates on the same basis as
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates, and (iii) continue
to maintain the Benefit Plan set forth on  _Section 5.9(a)(iii) of the

Company and its Affiliates and their respective predecessors to the same
extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled to credit for such service
under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Transition Date, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect
to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. " _Transition Date_" means, with respect to any
Continuing Employee, the date Parent or the Surviving Corporation commences
providing benefits to such employee with respect to each New Plan.

preparation and execution of all documentation necessary to effect the
foregoing termination(s), and Company shall provide Parent a reasonable

dependent thereof), or any Person or any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Benefit Plan or any

benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Surviving Corporation, Company or any of their respective Affiliates; or (ii)

arrangement after the Effective Time.

(b) If requested by Parent, Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take any actions so requested to effect the redemption,

7.1(c)(i)_, and after the date hereof but prior to the breach giving rise to
such right of termination, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been
announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Company Board or any
Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional)
to make such an Acquisition Proposal, (y) this Agreement is terminated by
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ (other than under
circumstances in which Parent is required to pay the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to  _Section 7.3(c)_ or upon any other failure of the condition set
forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ to be satisfied by the Outside Date (as extended)
(other than where such other failure was principally caused by, or resulted
from, a material breach by Company of this Agreement)), and after the date
hereof but prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly announced or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make such an Acquisition Proposal, or (z)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ and, after the date hereof but prior to the Shareholder Meeting,
an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced, disclosed or otherwise
communicated to Companys shareholders or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make such an
Acquisition Proposal, and (B) within 12 months after the date of such
termination, a transaction in respect of an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated or Company enters into a definitive agreement in respect of such
an Acquisition Proposal that is later consummated; _provided_ that if any
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clauses _(A)(x)_ , _(A)(y)_ or (A)(z)
would constitute an Acquisition Proposal if all percentages included in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" were increased to "50%" (and regardless
of whether there is also a separate Acquisition Proposal that is a Gulf South
Transaction Proposal), then the requirements of this _Section 7.3(b)(i)_
would not be satisfied if the Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (B)
were a Gulf South Transaction Proposal; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_
(or is terminated by Parent or Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ at
a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_);
or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_;

then, in any such event, Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of
$50,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event
shall Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. Payment of the Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of
same day funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent (A) at the time
of consummation of any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, in
the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(i)_, (B)
as promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event,
within two Business Days thereof), in the case of a Termination Fee payable
pursuant to  _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_, and (C) at the time of termination, in
the case of termination by Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except in the case
of fraud or a willful and material breach of this Agreement, in the event
that the Termination Fee becomes payable, then payment to

 



57  Parent of the Termination Fee, together with any amounts due under _Section
7.3(d)_, shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy as
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages of any nature against
Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective former, current and
future directors, officers, employees, agents, general and limited partners,
managers, members, shareholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former,
current or future director, officer, employee, agent, shareholder, general or
limited partner, manager, member, shareholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of
the foregoing (collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") in respect of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement), and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the
termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Merger to be consummated or

unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise, and upon payment of such
Termination Fee no Company Party shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

(c) In the event that this Agreement (A) is terminated (x) by Parent or
Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ due to the failure of any Antitrust
Condition to be satisfied, or (y) by Parent or Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ due to a final and nonappealable judgment, order, injunction, rule
or decree or other final and nonappealable action enjoining or prohibiting or
otherwise making illegal consummation of the Merger, in each case, under any
Antitrust Law, or (z) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_, and (B) at
the time of such termination each of the conditions set forth in _Sections
6.1_ and _6.2_  have been satisfied or waived (other than (1) the Antitrust
Conditions and (2) those other conditions that by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the Closing Date, but which would be satisfied if the Closing
Date were the date of such termination), then Parent shall pay to Company a
termination fee of $100,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by wire
transfer of same day funds at the time of termination in the case of a
termination by Parent or within two Business Days after such termination in
the case of a termination by Company, it being understood that in no event
shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except
in the case of fraud or a willful and material breach of this Agreement, in
the event that the Parent Termination Fee becomes payable, then payment to
Company of the Parent Termination Fee, together with any amounts due under 
_Section 7.3(d)_, shall be Companys sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages of any nature against Parent and
Merger Sub and each of their respective former, current and future
directors, officers, employees, agents, general and limited partners,
managers, members, shareholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former,
current or future director, officer, employee, agent, shareholder, general or
limited partner, manager, member, shareholder, Affiliate or assignee of any
of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Parties_ ") in respect of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith (other than
Confidentiality Agreement), and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the
termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Merger to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether
intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise, and upon payment
of such Parent Termination Fee no Parent Party shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



58 (d) Each of Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this  _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement. If Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due
pursuant to  _Section 7.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Company for the amounts
set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_, Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in

promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_, and, in order

against Parent for the amounts set forth in _Section 7.3(c)_, Parent shall
pay to Company its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in _Section 7.3(c)_ from the date of
termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate.

 

Section 7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the Shareholder Approval has been obtained; _provided_

be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption
by the shareholders of Company without such further approval or adoption. This
Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether
by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing
specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of
the parties in interest at the time of the amendment.

Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other
parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered
pursuant hereto, or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions of the other parties contained herein;
_provided_ , _that_ after the Shareholder Approval has been obtained, no
waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval
or adoption by the shareholders of Company without such further approval or
adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a
duly authorized officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any
party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power,
or any course

 



59  of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they
would otherwise have hereunder.
