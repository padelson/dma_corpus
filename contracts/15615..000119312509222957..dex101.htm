WHEREAS, Mrs. Murphy is the spouse of Murphy and Mrs. Rooney is the spouse of

and

WHEREAS, the Buyer desires to purchase the Precision Units and the Transport
Units from the Sellers and the Transport Sellers, respectively, and the
Sellers and the Transport Sellers desire to sell all of the Precision Units
and the Transport Units, respectively, to the Buyer upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. _AGREEMENT_

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual promises herein
made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties and covenants
herein contained, the Buyer, MasTec, the Sellers, Mrs. Murphy and Mrs. Rooney
hereby agree as follows:



   1. | PURCHASE AND SALE OF UNITS. 
---|--- 

1.1  _Purchase and Sale of Units_. At the Closing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers and the Transport Sellers will sell,
transfer and deliver to the Buyer, and the Buyer will purchase from the
Sellers and the Transport Sellers, the Precision Units and the Transport
Units, respectively, free and clear of any and all Encumbrances other than
restrictions on the transfer of securities arising under federal and state
securities laws and Encumbrances created by the Buyer.

1.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Units (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") shall be paid to the Sellers and CAC as set forth on
_Schedule 1.2_ and is equal to:

1.2.1 the Cash Purchase Price; _plus_

1.2.2 the Earn-Out Payments; and

1.2.3 Subject to adjustment as provided in this _Section 1_.

1.3 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The parties agree that the Contemplated
Transactions will be governed by Revenue Ruling 99-6 for federal, state and
local income tax purposes. The Purchase Price plus the liabilities of the
Companies assumed, or taken subject to, by the Buyer (together with the
Purchase Price, the " _Allocated Purchase Price_ ") shall be allocated among
the Companies Assets and the covenants set forth in _Section 5.2.1_ in
accordance with the Code (and any similar provision of state or local law, as
appropriate) as set forth on _Schedule 1.3_ (the " _Allocation_ "), including
those fair market values set forth in the appraisal attached to _Schedule
1.3_. Sellers and Buyer shall each report the federal, state, local and other
Tax consequences of the Contemplated Transactions, including the preparation
and filing of Form 8594, consistent with the Allocation. Buyer and Sellers
agree that the Purchase Price reflects the fair market value of the Companies
Assets, and the Allocated Purchase Price will be allocated among the Assets
and the covenants set forth in _Section 5.2.1_ as described in this _Section
1.3_. Buyer and Sellers will act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with
each other to agree on the final Allocation on or before the thirtieth (30th)
day after the Closing Date consistent with _Schedule 1.3_ , will cooperate
with each other in the preparation of such forms, and will furnish each other
with a copy of the final version of Form 8594 at least ten (10) days before
the filing date thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount
contained in the Allocation in respect of the covenants set forth in _Section
5.2.1_ exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), then, on or prior to
April 10, 2010, Buyer shall pay to Sellers, as set forth on _Schedule 1.2_ ,
an amount equal to (x) the amount of such excess _multiplied_ by (y) 0.265.
For example: if One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) is allocated to the covenants
set forth in  _Section 5.2.1_, then the amount of the excess would be Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), and the amount payable by Buyer to
Sellers, as set forth on _Schedule 1.2_ , would be $500,000 multiplied by
0.265, which equals $132,500.



 

-2- 1.4 _Estimate of Purchase Price_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare in accordance with Precision GAAP
and deliver to Buyer the Sellers good faith reasonable estimate of the
Companies consolidated balance sheet as of the Effective Date (the "
_Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a certificate (substantially in the
form of _Exhibit A_ ) executed by both the chief executive officer and vice
president of finance of each Company (the " _Closing Certificate_ ") setting
forth Sellers estimate of each of the following as set forth on the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet:

1.4.1 all Debt (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ ");

1.4.2 the net book value of the PPandE (the " _Estimated PP andE_"); and

1.4.3 Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ").

Following receipt of the Closing Certificate, Sellers shall permit Buyer and
its Representatives at all reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to
review the Sellers, the Companies and their accountants working papers
relating to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Certificate as
well as the Sellers and the Companies accounting books and records relating
to the determination of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Closing
Certificate, and Sellers shall make reasonably available their Representatives
responsible for the preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Certificate in order to respond to the inquiries of the Buyer.
Prior to the Closing, the parties shall act reasonably in resolving in good
faith any disagreements concerning the computation of any of the items on the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Certificate; provided that it is
acknowledged and agreed that if any disagreements cannot be resolved, then the
Closing shall occur on the basis of the Closing Certificate provided
by Sellers, and that any unresolved disagreements shall be deferred for
resolution pursuant to the post-closing purchase price adjustment process
described in _Section 1.8_.

1.5 _Payment of Closing Date Purchase Price_. At Closing, the Buyer shall:

1.5.1 pay to the Sellers and CAC as set forth on _Schedule 1.2_ in cash (the "
_Cash Purchase Price_ ") an amount equal to:

(a) One-Hundred-Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000); _minus_

(b) if the Estimated PPandE is less than Forty-Four Million Dollars
($44,000,000), the difference between Forty-Four Million Dollars
($44,000,000) and the Estimated PPandE; _minus_

(c) the Estimated Indebtedness; provided that if the Estimated PPandE is in
excess of Forty-Four Million Dollars $44,000,000 (the amount of such excess,
if any, an " _Estimated PP andE Surplus_"), then Estimated Indebtedness shall be
deemed automatically reduced, without any action by the parties, by an amount
equal to the lower of (x) the Estimated PPandE Surplus and (y) Twenty Million
Dollars ($20,000,000); _minus_



 

-3- (d) if the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than Nine Million
Dollars ($9,000,000), the difference between Nine Million Dollars
($9,000,000) and the Estimated Net Working Capital; _plus_

(e) if the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than Nine Million Dollars
($9,000,000), the difference between the Estimated Net Working Capital and
Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000); and _minus_  

(f) those Buyers Expenses set forth on _Schedule 1.5.1(f)_ as delivered by
Buyer to the Sellers Representative at or prior to Closing;

_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall, out of the Cash Purchase Price to
be paid to the Sellers, deposit in the Escrow Account on behalf of the
Sellers pursuant to _Section 1.6_ below (such deposit, the " _Escrow Fund_
"), comprising Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) in cash from the Cash
Purchase Price; and, _provided further_ , Sellers authorize Buyer to pay out
of the Cash Purchase Price all Closing Date Seller Expenses in accordance with
such instruction as Sellers Representative may give to Buyer and any Closing
Date Seller Expenses so paid will not be reflected in the Actual Closing
Balance Sheet or Actual Net Working Capital.

1.5.2 _Method of Cash Payments_. All cash payments made under this _Section
1.5_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or
more accounts designated by the recipient in writing no fewer than two (2)
Business Days immediately preceding the scheduled Closing Date.

1.6 _Escrow_. To provide for an escrow account or accounts to secure and to
serve as a fund in respect of the indemnification obligations of Sellers under
this Agreement, Buyer, Sellers and JP Morgan Chase Bank, National Association,
as Escrow Agent, (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), at Closing shall enter into an
Escrow Agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ "). At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit the Escrow Fund with the
Escrow Agent to be held in an account or accounts (the " _Escrow Account_ "),
which shall bear interest on the Escrow Fund, pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. Except with respect to amounts that have been previously
paid from the Escrow Account to Buyer pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and
except with respect to claims pursuant to _Section 1.8_ and indemnity claims
made in accordance with _Section 9_ or _Section 10_ on or before the
eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Period_
"), all amounts (in excess of all pending claims) in the Escrow Account (with
any interest or other earnings paid thereon) shall be distributed to Sellers
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement on the first Business Day after the
expiration of the Escrow Period; provided that with respect to any pending
claim, promptly following resolution of such pending claim, the amount, if
any, of such pending claim which has not been paid, which is not payable
to any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section 1.8_, _Section 9.1_ or
_Section 10_ in connection with such resolution, and which is not required to
remain in the Escrow Account to satisfy other pending claims shall be paid to
the Sellers.

1.7 _Allocation of Payments_. As among Sellers and CAC, any Purchase Price
payable to Sellers or CAC, payments payable to Sellers from the Escrow
Account or otherwise payable to Sellers or CAC under this _Section 1_, shall
be paid as set forth on _Schedule 1.2_.



 

-4- 1.8 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

1.8.1 As soon as practicable but in no event more than one hundred twenty
(120) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and deliver to the Sellers Representative: (a) a consolidated
balance sheet of the Companies as of the Effective Date prepared in accordance
with Precision GAAP (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "); and (b) a certificate
substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ executed by MasTecs Chief Financial
Officer (the " _Final Closing Statement_ ") setting forth each of
the following as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet: (i) the actual net
book value of PPandE (the " _Actual PP andE_"); (ii) the actual aggregate amount
of the Companies Debt (the " _Actual Indebtedness_ "); (iii) the actual Net
Working Capital (" _Actual Net Working Capital_ "); and (iv) the amount of all
Receivables included in Actual Net Working Capital included in the Closing
Balance Sheet which were not collected on or prior to the ninetieth (90th)
day after the Closing Date (the " _Actual Uncollected Receivables_ ").

1.8.2 The Sellers and their accountants shall complete their review of the
Closing Balance Sheet and Final Closing Statement within 30 days after
delivery thereof by the Buyer. During such review period, Buyer shall provide
Sellers Representative with access to all books and records reasonably
requested by Sellers Representative to review the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Final Closing Statement and any work papers prepared by Buyer or its
accountants in connection with such calculations, and Buyer shall
make reasonably available its Representatives responsible for the preparation
of the Closing Balance Sheet and Final Closing Statement in order to respond
to the inquiries of Sellers Representative. If the Sellers object to the
Closing Balance Sheet or Final Closing Statement for any reason, the Sellers
Representative shall, on or before the last day of such 30-day period, so
inform the Buyer in writing (a " _Sellers  Objection_"), setting forth a
specific description of the basis of the Sellers determination and the
adjustments to the Closing Balance Sheet or Final Closing Statement that the
Sellers believe should be made. To the extent any disagreement therewith is
not described in a Sellers Objection received by the Buyer on or before the
last day of such 30-day period, then all items described on the Closing
Balance Sheet and Final Closing Statement delivered by the Buyer to the
Sellers Representative shall be deemed agreed, final and binding on the
parties.

1.8.3 If the Sellers Representative timely delivers a Sellers Objection to
the Buyer and the Sellers Representative and the Buyer are unable to resolve
all of their disagreements with respect to the proposed adjustments set forth
in the Sellers Objection within thirty (30) days following the Buyers
receipt of the Sellers Objection, then they shall jointly retain the CPA
Firm, which, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall determine, on
the basis set forth in and in accordance with this  _Section 1.8_, and only
with respect to those items in the Sellers Objection on which the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative have not agreed, whether and to what extent, if
any, the Cash Purchase Price requires adjustment. The Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall instruct the CPA Firm to deliver its written
determination to the Buyer and the Sellers Representative no later than 30
days after submitting the matter to it for resolution. At the time
of retention of the CPA Firm, the Buyer shall specify in writing to the CPA
Firm and the Sellers Representative the amount of Buyers computation of the
Cash Purchase Price (the " _Buyer s Position_"), and the Sellers
Representative shall specify in writing to the CPA Firm and to the Buyer the
amount of the Sellers computation of the Cash Purchase Price (the " _Sellers
 Position_"). The CPA Firms determination shall be  



 

-5-  conclusive and binding upon the Buyer and the Sellers. In resolving any
disputed item, the CPA Firm may not assign a value to any disputed item that
is greater than the greatest value claimed by the Buyer or the Sellers
Representative at the time the CPA Firm is retained or less than the smallest
value claimed for the item by the Buyer or the Sellers Representative at such
time. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the CPA Firm is limited to
whether the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of
Actual PPandE, Actual Indebtedness and Actual Net Working Capital were done in a
manner consistent with Precision GAAP and otherwise in accordance with this
Agreement, and the CPA Firm is not to make any other determination unless
jointly requested in writing by the Sellers Representative and the Buyer. The
fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm and the reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses of the parties relating to the disputes submitted to the CPA Firm
(collectively, the " _Purchase Price Dispute Expenses_ ") shall be borne (i)
jointly and severally by the Sellers in that proportion equal to a
fraction (expressed as a percentage) the numerator of which is equal to
Sellers Position minus the Cash Purchase Price determined by the CPA Firm,
and the denominator of which is equal to Sellers Position minus Buyers
Position and (ii) by Buyer in that proportion equal to a fraction (expressed
as a percentage) equal to one (1) minus the fraction described in clause (i).
For example, if the Sellers Position is that the Cash Purchase Price should
be $175,000,000 and the Buyers Position is that the Cash Purchase Price
should be $174,000,000, the CPA Firm determines that the Cash Purchase Price
should be $174,600,000 and the Purchase Price Dispute Expenses are $50,000,
then (i) the Sellers shall pay $20,000 (40%) of the Purchase Price Dispute
Expenses and (ii) the Buyer shall pay $30,000 (60%) of the Purchase Price
Dispute Expenses. The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate with the CPA Firm
during its resolution of the disagreement and make readily available to the
CPA Firm all relevant books and records and any work papers (including those
of the parties respective accountants, to the extent permitted by such
accountants) relating to the Closing Balance Sheet, Final Closing Statement
and the Sellers Objection and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA
Firm in connection therewith.

1.8.4 The Closing Balance Sheet, PPandE, Debt and Net Working Capital, as agreed
to (or deemed to have been agreed to) between Buyer and Sellers
Representative or as determined by the CPA Firm, as applicable, shall be
conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto and shall be deemed the "
_Actual Closing Balance Sheet_ ", " _Actual PP andE_", " _Actual Indebtedness_
", " _Actual Net Working Capital_ " and " _Actual Uncollected Receivables_ ",
respectively, for all purposes herein.

(a) Upon completion of the calculation of the Actual Closing Balance Sheet,
Actual PPandE, Actual Indebtedness and Actual Net Working Capital in accordance
with this _Section 1.8_, the Cash Purchase Price shall be recalculated, and
the following adjustments (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment_ ") made:

(i) If the Cash Purchase Price calculated using the Actual PPandE, Actual
Indebtedness and Actual Net Working Capital shown on the Actual Closing
Balance Sheet is greater than the Cash Purchase Price calculated using the
Estimated PPandE, Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated Net Working Capital
shown on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, then the Buyer shall pay such
difference to the Sellers and CAC as set forth on _Schedule 1.2_ by wire
transfer in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days
thereafter to the accounts designated by the Sellers Representative.



 

-6- (ii) If the Cash Purchase Price calculated using the Actual PPandE, Actual
Indebtedness and Actual Net Working Capital shown on the Actual Closing
Balance Sheet is less than the Cash Purchase Price calculated using the
Estimated PPandE, Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated Net Working Capital shown
on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, then within (2) Business Days
thereafter the amount of such difference will be (A) paid to the Buyer,
jointly and severally by the Sellers, or (B) at Buyers election, by
withdrawal of such amount from the Escrow Fund (and in the case of clause
(B), the Buyer and Sellers Representative will, during such two (2) Business
Day period, deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction to make
such distribution).

1.9 _Closing_.

1.9.1 _Closing Date_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the sale and purchase of the Units contemplated by this Agreement shall take
place at a closing (the " _Closing_ " and the date on which the Closing

such payments to the appropriate payees in a timely fashion.



 

-9- 1.10 _Earn-Out_.

1.10.1 In addition to the Closing Date Purchase Price, and as additional
consideration for the purchase of the Units, the Buyer shall pay to the
Sellers and CAC as set forth on _Schedule 1.2_ , contingent payments (the "
_Earn-Out Payments_ ") as determined pursuant to this _Section 1.10_ at the
times, in the manner and to the extent Earn-Out Payments are earned pursuant
to the following terms:

(a) with respect to the Companies consolidated 2009 Earn-Out Period EBITDA,
40% of the Companies consolidated 2009 Earn-Out Period EBITDA will be paid to
the Sellers;

(b) with respect to the Companies consolidated 2010 Earn-Out Period EBITDA,
30% of the amount (if any) by which the Companies consolidated 2010 Earn-Out
Period EBITDA exceeds $35,000,000 will be paid to the Sellers;

(c) with respect to the Companies consolidated 2011 Earn-Out Period EBITDA,
30% of the amount (if any) by which the Companies consolidated 2011 Earn-Out
Period EBITDA exceeds $35,000,000 will be paid to the Sellers;

(d) with respect to the Companies consolidated 2012 Earn-Out Period EBITDA,
30% of the amount (if any) by which the Companies consolidated 2012 Earn-Out
Period EBITDA exceeds $35,000,000 will be paid to the Sellers;

(e) with respect to the Companies consolidated 2013 Earn-Out Period EBITDA,
30% of the amount (if any) by which the Companies consolidated 2013 Earn-Out
Period EBITDA exceeds $35,000,000 will be paid to the Sellers; and

(f) with respect to the Companies consolidated 2014 Earn-Out Period EBITDA,
30% of the amount (if any) by which the Companies consolidated 2014 Earn-Out
Period EBITDA exceeds $29,166,667 will be paid to the Sellers.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Companies consolidated EBITDA for
any Earn-Out Period is negative (any such Earn-Out Period, a " _Negative
EBITDA Earn-Out Period_ "), taking into account the adjustment to such EBITDA
resulting from a prior Negative EBITDA Earn-Out Period as set forth in this
_subsection 1.10.1(g)_ , the Companies consolidated EBITDA for the
subsequent Earn-Out Period shall be reduced by the amount by which EBITDA for
the Negative EBITDA Earn-Out Period was less than zero. For example, if the
2009 Earn-Out Period is a Negative EBITDA Earn-Out Period in which the
Companies consolidated EBITDA is negative $1 million and if the 2010 Earn-Out
Period is a Negative EBITDA Earn-Out Period in which the Companies
consolidated EBITDA (excluding any reduction for the negative EBITDA for the
2009 Earn-Out Period) is negative $2 million, then the Companies consolidated
EBITDA for the 2011 Earn-Out Period shall be reduced by $3 million as a result
of the negative $2 million of EBITDA in the 2010 Earn-Out Period and the
negative $1 million of EBITDA in the 2009 Earn-Out Period.



 

-10- 1.10.2 For purposes of this _Section 1.10_, " _Earn-Out Period_ " shall mean
the period commencing on January 1 and ending of December 31 of the relevant
year, provided, that (i) the " _Earn-Out Period_ " for 2009 shall commence on
the Effective Date and end on December 31, 2009, and (ii) the " _Earn-Out
Period_ " for 2014 shall commence on January 1, 2014 and end one day prior to
the five year anniversary of the Effective Date.

1.10.3 For purposes of this _Section 1.10_, " _EBITDA_ " means for any Earn-
Out Period the _sum_  of (a) the consolidated net income or loss generated by
the Companies consolidated operations as they exist on the Effective Date and
as they may grow or contract after the Effective Date in the normal course of
business through internal growth and acquisitions made by Buyer or Precision
with the prior written consent of Sellers Representative (" _Approved
Acquisitions_ ") and not through acquisitions other than Approved Acquisitions
(which acquisitions which are not Approved Acquisitions the Buyer and its
Affiliates may make in their sole discretion so long as such acquisitions are
kept separate from the Companies) or other extraordinary transactions (the "
_Existing Operations_ "), as reflected in the Companies consolidated EO
Financial Statements for the Earn-Out Period, after deduction (to the extent
included in the consolidated net income of the Companies and without
duplication) of all costs, expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization, and other proper charges (including (i) the cost of any bonuses
or incentive payments earned with respect to the applicable period (excluding
any Earn-Out Payment), (ii) the cost of any equity granted to employees of
the Companies, or other derivative securities granted during the applicable
period, valued in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123(R) and (iii) all interest and amortization with respect to
the Companies Debt, including all Debt reflected on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet) _plus_ (b) all (i) interest expense (including imputed interest in
capital lease payments), (ii) federal, state, or local income taxes and state
franchise taxes to the extent based upon net income and not revenue (including
any payments under tax-sharing arrangements with the Buyer or its Affiliates),
(iii) depreciation expense, (iv) amortization expense and (v) any non-cash
impairment charges, in each case of (i) through (v) as attributable to the
Existing Operations, but only to the extent deducted in determining the amount
in clause (a). For the determination of EBITDA, the Buyer will cause to
be prepared for each Earn-Out Period a set of financial statements reflecting
the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations
(" _EO Financial Statements_ "). Each of the EO Financial Statements shall
be prepared in accordance with Precision GAAP and with (A) no deduction of
any expenses relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions (including any fees and expenses related to the financing of the
Contemplated Transactions or any amortization of goodwill), (B) no deduction
for any management fees or general overhead expenses, (C) any purchases of any
goods or services from either or both of the Companies by the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to be adjusted to reflect the lowest amount that the Companies
would have realized if dealing with an independent party in an arms-length
commercial transaction at the best price and best other terms (from the
customers perspective) for such goods or services provided to any Person by
the Companies (D) any costs for goods, services or benefits (including
insurance and employee-welfare benefits) provided to the Companies by the
Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer to not exceed the Buyers or such
Affiliates actual cost of furnishing such goods, services or benefits and (E)
no deduction for any Loss to the extent that the Buyer has received
indemnification from the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement and which payment
is not subject to any dispute.



 

-11- 1.10.4 The Buyer will pay to the Sellers the Earn-Out Payment with respect to
a specific Earn-Out Period, if any Earn-Out Payment is owed, no later than the
March 31st next succeeding such Earn-Out Period (or ninety (90) days after the
2014 Earn-Out Period). If Sellers Representative delivers an Earn-Out
Objection pursuant to _Section 1.10.6_ and it is ultimately determined
pursuant to _Section 1.10.6_ that an additional amount for a particular Earn-
Out Period is payable to Sellers, Buyer shall, within three (3) Business Days
after the CPA Firms determination is delivered to the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative, pay the such additional amount. Each Earn-Out Payment will be
made, at the Buyers option (i) in cash in immediately available funds or
(ii) in the common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of MasTec (" _MasTec
Common Stock_ "), valued at the average closing price of the MasTec Common
Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange (or as quoted on such other
principal U.S. exchange or over-the-counter market on which MasTec Common
Stock is then traded) for the ten (10) trading days prior to the applicable
payment date or (iii) in any combination of cash or MasTec Common Stock. If
Buyer issues MasTec Common Stock for some, or any portion, of any Earn-Out
Payment, such shares, at the time of their issuance, will be: (i) validly
authorized shares and (ii) registered for resale pursuant to an effective
registration statement that has been filed with the SEC which registration
statement will remain effective as set forth in the Registration Rights
Agreement.

1.10.5 Except as set forth in _Section 1.10.11_, the Sellers will be entitled
to the Earn-Out Payments, if earned, whether or not Rooney or Murphy remain
employed by the Buyer or its Affiliates, including the Companies following the
Closing; provided that nothing in this Agreement (other than, for clarity, the
Principals Employment Agreements attached hereto) constitutes an agreement or
understanding to employ Rooney or Murphy for a term of years or otherwise
guarantee Rooneys or Murphys employment with the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, including the Companies following the Closing. 

1.10.6 On or prior to March 31st of each calendar year immediately following
the expiration of each Earn-Out Period (other than with respect to the 2014
Earn-Out Period, which will be calculated on or before the last day of the
third month following the last day of the 2014 Earn-Out Period), the Buyer
will calculate the Earn-Out Payment, if any, for such period and provide
the Sellers Representative with the Buyers calculation of the Earn-Out
Payment and a copy of the EO Financial Statements for the Earn-Out Period. For
sixty (60) days following Buyers delivery of the Earn-Out Payment calculation
to the Sellers Representative (the " _Earn-Out Review Period_ "), the
Sellers may review the Earn-Out Payment calculation and other documentation.
During the Earn-Out Review Period, the Buyer shall provide
Sellers Representative with access to all books and records and any work
papers utilized by Buyer or its accountants in preparing the EO Financial
Statements and calculating the proposed Earn-Out Payments, and to the Buyers
personnel involved in preparing the EO Financial Statements and calculating
the proposed Earn-Out Payments, as reasonably requested to review the Buyers
calculation of the Earn-Out Payment. If the Sellers object to the amount of
the Earn-Out Payment for any reason, the Sellers Representative shall, on or
before the last day of the Earn-Out Review Period, so inform the Buyer, in
writing (an " _Earn-Out Objection_ "), setting forth a 



 

-12-  specific description of the basis of the Sellers objection and the
adjustments to the Earn-Out Payment that the Sellers believe should be made.
To the extent any disagreement therewith is not described in an Earn-Out
Objection received by the Buyer on or before the last day of the Earn-Out
Review Period, then the Earn-Out Payment calculation prepared by the Buyer and
delivered to the Sellers Representative shall be deemed agreed, final and
binding on the parties. If the Sellers Representative timely delivers an
Earn-Out Objection to the Buyer, and the Buyer and the Sellers Representative
are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to the Earn-Out
Payment within thirty (30) days after the end of the Earn-Out Review Period,
then the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall jointly retain the CPA
Firm, which, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall
determine, on the basis set forth in and in accordance with this _Section
1.10_, and only with respect to those specific adjustments in the Earn-Out
Objection on which the Buyer and the Sellers Representative have not agreed,
whether and to what extent, if any, the Earn-Out Payment amount requires
adjustment. The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall instruct the CPA
Firm to deliver its written determination to the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative no later than 30 days after submitting the matter to it for
resolution. At the time of retention of the CPA Firm, Buyer shall specify in
writing to the CPA Firm and the Sellers Representative the amount of Buyers
computation of the Earn-Out Payment (the " _Buyer s Earn-Out Position_"),
and the Sellers Representative shall specify in writing to the CPA Firm and
to the Buyer the amount of the Sellers computation of the Earn-Out Payment
(the " _Sellers  Earn-Out Position_"). The CPA Firms determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties. In resolving any disputed item, the
CPA Firm may not assign a value to any disputed item that is greater than the
greatest value claimed by Buyer or the Sellers Representative at the time
the CPA Firm is retained or less than the smallest value claimed for the item
by the Buyer or the Sellers Representative at such time. The scope of the
disputes to be resolved by the CPA Firm is limited to whether the calculation
of the Earn-Out Payment was done in a manner consistent with Precision GAAP
(as modified by _Section 1.10.3_) and in accordance with this Agreement, and
the CPA Firm is not to make any other determination unless jointly requested
in writing by the Sellers Representative and Buyer. The fees and
disbursements of the CPA Firm and the reasonable attorneys fees and expenses
of the parties relating to the disputes submitted to the CPA Firm
(collectively, the " _Earn-Out Dispute Expenses_ ") shall be borne (i) jointly
and severally by the Sellers in that proportion equal to a fraction (expressed
as a percentage) the numerator of which is equal to Sellers Earn-Out
Position _minus_ the Earn-Out Payment determined by the CPA Firm, and the
denominator of which is equal to Sellers Earn-Out Position minus Buyers
Earn-Out Position and (ii) by Buyer in that proportion equal to a fraction
(expressed as a percentage) equal to one (1) minus the fraction described in
clause (i). For example, if the Sellers Earn-Out Position is that the Earn-
Out Payment should be $5,000,000 and the Buyers Earn-Out Position is that
the Earn-Out Payment should be $4,000,000, the CPA Firm determines that the
Earn-Out Payment should be $4,600,000 and the Earn-Out Dispute Expenses are
$50,000, then (i) the Sellers shall pay $20,000 (40%) of the Earn-Out Dispute
Expenses and (ii) the Buyer shall pay $30,000 (60%) of the Earn-Out Dispute
Expenses. The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate with the CPA Firm during
its resolution of the disagreement and make readily available to the CPA
Firm all relevant books and records and any work papers (including those of
the parties respective accountants, to the extent permitted by such
accountants) relating to the determination of the Earn-Out Payment and all
other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm in connection therewith.



 

-13- 1.10.7 Following the Closing Date, the Buyer will continue to operate
the Companies during the period for which the Sellers are entitled to Earn-
Out Payments substantially as previously operated, as one or more separate
entities that continue to own and conduct the Existing Operations, subject to
the business requirements of the Buyer and its Affiliates taken as a whole.
The Buyer will be permitted, following the Closing Date, to make changes at
its sole discretion to the operations, corporate organization, personnel,
accounting practices, and other aspects of the Companies and the Businesses
so long as such changes are made in good faith, in the best interests of the
Companies, the Buyer, and their respective Affiliates or to conform to
standard practices applicable generally to other Buyer Affiliates, and not
with the specific intent of reducing amounts that otherwise would be payable
to the Sellers.

1.10.8 By no later than November 30th of each calendar year containing an
Earn-Out Period, the Companies and the Sellers Representative will prepare
and present to MasTecs Chief Operating Officer an annual budget along with
the proposed capital allocation requirements (collectively, the " _Annual
Budget_ ") for the next succeeding year. MasTecs Chief Operating Officer will
be entitled to review and propose revisions to the Annual Budget, and, subject
to the Sellers Representatives acceptance of the proposed revisions, the
Companies shall operate in accordance with such revised Annual Budget (the "
_Revised Annual Budget_ "). If the Sellers Representative has a reasonable
basis to believe that the proposed Revised Annual Budget is insufficient to
allow the Companies to pursue a material portion of identified Precision
Business (" _Identified Excluded Business_ "), then the Sellers
Representative may provide projections for such Identified Excluded Business,
together with the corresponding additional capital allocations omitted from
the proposed Revised Annual Budget, to MasTecs Chief Executive Officer for
review. MasTecs Chief Executive Officer will review Sellers
Representatives projections for such Identified Excluded Business, together
with the proposed additional capital allocations, and will determine whether
such Identified Excluded Business, together with the corresponding
increase in capital allocations, should be incorporated as part of the
Revised Annual Budget. If Sellers Representative is dissatisfied with the
Chief Executive Officers proposed revisions to the Revised Annual Budget,
taking into consideration such Identified Excluded Business and the
corresponding increase in capital allocations requested by Sellers
Representative, then upon the Sellers Representatives request, the Chief
Executive Officer shall submit his determination, Sellers Representatives
projections for such Identified Excluded Business and the corresponding
increase in capital allocations related thereto to MasTecs Board of
Directors, or to the appropriate committee thereof, (the " _Board_ "), for
its consideration. The Board shall have an opportunity to review the Annual
Budget, the proposed Revised Annual Budget and to receive a presentation by
Sellers Representative, setting forth the reasons why the Sellers disapprove
of the proposed Revised Annual Budget. The determination of the Board, which
shall include its requested revisions to the Revised Budget, shall become the
approved Annual Budget (the " _Approved Annual Budget_ ") and shall be
accepted, final and binding upon MasTecs Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Operating Officer and the Sellers.

1.10.9 _Affiliated Transactions_. From the Effective Date through the last day
of the 2014 Earn Out Period, Buyer shall permit Precision to continue
conducting business with KandM Equipment, Inc., an Illinois corporation,
Midwest Underground, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation, and Indianhead Pipeline
Services, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company, provided that such
Persons provide services to Precision (i) at prices less than or equal to the
lowest bid submitted to Precision by an unaffiliated third Person and (ii) in
a manner consistent with or comparable to similar services provided by
unaffiliated third Persons.



 

-14- 1.10.10 _Limited Transferability of Earn-Out_. Without the Buyers prior
written consent, which may be withheld in Buyers sole discretion, the
Sellers and CACs rights to receive Earn-Out Payments, if any, are personal
to the Sellers and CAC and shall not, in whole or in part, be sold,
transferred, assigned or otherwise conveyed or pledged or encumbered or have
Encumbrances created with respect to them; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
Seller may transfer such right to a Member of the Immediate Family of such
Seller, in each case subject to the transferees agreeing in writing to the
terms and conditions of this _Section 1.10_ and with a copy of such written
agreement being promptly provided to Buyer.

1.10.11 _Forfeiture of Earn-Out Payments_. It is the intent of the parties
that Earn-Out Payments will be paid to Sellers and CAC only for such periods
during which Sellers are in compliance with their obligations pursuant to
_Section 5.2_. Accordingly, should at any time following the Closing Date any
Seller breach its obligations pursuant  _Section 5.2_ (a " _Restrictive
Covenant Breach_ "), then during the continuance of such Restrictive Covenant
Breach (the " _Noncompliance Period_ "), no Earn-Out Payments shall be earned
by or payable to Sellers or CAC. If a Restrictive Covenant Breach is cured,
then Buyers obligation to make Earn-Out Payments in accordance with _Section
1.10_ shall resume commencing on the next succeeding day, but no amounts shall
be payable with respect to the Noncompliance Period. If a Noncompliance
Period covers less than the whole of one or more Earn-Out Periods (each such
Earn-Out Period, a " _Hybrid Earn-Out Period_ "), then the amount of the Earn-
Out Payments for the portion of each Hybrid Earn-Out Period which is not
included in the Noncompliance Period (the " _Compliance Period_ ") shall be
determined as set forth in _Section 1.10.1_ without amendment, except that
only the Companies consolidated EBITDA generated during the Compliance
Period shall be counted and all EBITDA generated during the Noncompliance
Period shall be disregarded. If MasTecs Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Operating Officer or General Counsel has actual knowledge of any Restrictive
Covenant Breach he shall promptly cause Buyer and/or MasTec to give notice to
the Sellers Representative of such Restrictive Covenant Breach.

1.11 _Collection and Assignment of Actual Uncollected Receivables_. If at any
time prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date any Actual
Uncollected Receivables shall be collected by either Company, then the
relevant Company shall pay to Sellers and CAC as set forth on _Schedule 1.2_
an amount equal to such collections less all reasonable collection costs
related to all Actual Uncollected Receivables which have not been previously
deducted from any payment pursuant to this _Section 1.11_. If upon the one
(1) year anniversary of the Closing Date any Actual Uncollected Receivables
remain uncollected, and Rooney or Murphy continues to be employed
by Precision or any of its Affiliates on such date, then the relevant Company
shall assign all of its rights to such Actual Uncollected Receivables to the
Sellers Representative. If neither Rooney nor Murphy is employed by Precision
or any of its Affiliates at such time, then the relevant Company shall hold
such Actual Uncollected Receivables and, if collected, will pay to Sellers and
CAC as set forth on _Schedule 1.2_ such amounts collected less all reasonable
collection costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Companies shall make
such efforts to collect such Actual Uncollected Receivables only as either
such Company deems reasonable in its discretion, taking into account the
detrimental impact such collection efforts could have on the Businesses.



 

-15- 1.12 _Reimbursement for and Assignment of Uncollected Retainage_. On or after
March 31, 2011 (the " _Uncollected Retainage Determination Date_ "), Buyer
shall determine the amount of retainage included in Actual Net Working Capital
not collected by the Companies on or prior to the Uncollected Retainage
Determination Date (" _Uncollected Retainage_ "). On or prior to the fifth
(5th) day following delivery by Buyer to the Sellers Representative of notice
of the Uncollected Retainage, the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall pay to
Buyer an amount equal to the Uncollected Retainage. If, upon the Uncollected
Retainage Determination Date, Rooney or Murphy continues to be employed by
Precision or any of its Affiliates, then the relevant Company shall assign all
of its rights to such Uncollected Retainage to the Sellers Representative.
If neither Rooney nor Murphy is employed by Precision or any of its Affiliates
at such time, then the relevant Company shall hold such Uncollected Retainage
and, if collected, will pay to Sellers as set forth on  _Schedule 1.2_ such
amounts collected less all reasonable collection costs. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Companies shall make such efforts to collect such Uncollected
Retainage only as either such Company deems reasonable in its discretion,
taking into account the detrimental impact such collection efforts could have
on the Businesses.

after giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 2.12_ , to the Sellers Knowledge, the Real Property and
its current use, occupancy and operation by the Companies and the Facilities
located thereon do not (a) constitute a nonconforming use under any applicable

which has been issued to or is otherwise owned by either Company or that

each Contractual Obligation pursuant to which either Company or any Seller
has granted or has been granted rights to any Intellectual Property or to
which any of them is otherwise bound to any third party, excluding however
"shrink wrap," "click through" or other standard agreements for commercially

Neither Company has any pending application for registration which such
Company has made or otherwise owns with respect to any Intellectual
Property. True, accurate and complete copies or summaries of all such
Contractual Obligations, as amended or otherwise modified and in effect, are
contained in the Data Room, together with true, accurate and complete copies
of all other written documentation evidencing ownership and prosecution (if
applicable) of each such item. All such Contractual Obligations are in full

allegation, or basis for any claim or allegation, that any Intellectual
Property owned or otherwise used by either Company is invalid or unenforceable
or that such Companys rights with respect thereto are subject to claims or
defenses that would impair or preclude enforcement of such rights, including
misuse, laches, acquiescence, statute of limitations, abandonment or
fraudulent registration. _Schedule 2.14_ also identifies each trade name,
trade dress and unregistered trademark or service mark used by either Company

Property used in its Business as currently conducted and as currently
contemplated to be conducted through December 31, 2010. The Intellectual
Property identified on _Schedule 2.14_ constitutes all registered Intellectual
Property that is used in the Businesses and all registered Intellectual

has the conduct of either Business, interfered with, infringed upon,
misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated or come into conflict with any
Intellectual Property rights of third parties or (b) has received any charge,
complaint, claim, demand, or notice alleging any such

license that it does not already possess or refrain from using same). To the
Sellers Knowledge, there does not exist any basis for any such claim or
allegation. To the Sellers Knowledge, no third party has interfered with,
infringed upon, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated or come
into conflict with any Company Technology or any of the Companys other
Intellectual Property. No claim or legal proceeding involving any Intellectual
Property by or against either Company is pending or, to the Sellers
Knowledge, has been threatened. Except as otherwise specified on _Schedule

currently conducted and as currently contemplated to be conducted through
December 31, 2010.

2.14.4 Except for that Software described on _Schedule 2.14_ , the Company

2.14_ ;

(b) to Sellers Knowledge, such item is not subject to any outstanding
Governmental Order, and no Action is pending or threatened, which challenges
the legality, validity, enforceability, use or ownership of such item, nor, to

relationships and none of such customers or the suppliers has canceled,
terminated or otherwise altered (including any reduction in the rate or
amount of sales or purchases, material increase in the prices charged or paid,
or change to the supply or credit terms, as the case may be) or notified
either Company of any intention to do any of the foregoing or

Seller has requested or which has been filed by MasTec with the SEC.



 

-41- 2.30.4 Each Seller has discussed with and relied upon the advice of
its independent legal counsel, tax and financial advisors with regard to the
meaning and legal consequences of such Sellers representations and warranties

(b) Any legend required by Law, including any legend required by the Business
Corporation Act of the State of Florida.

be required to obtain a substitute Surety Bond with respect to any of its
Surety Bonds and the Surety Bonds will remain in effect on identical terms
immediately following the Closing.

2.32 _Transport Operations_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.32_ ,

Agreement or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto shall
have any Liability for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement on account

and their Representatives have used and, unless the Closing occurs, will use
the Evaluation Material only in connection with their consideration of whether
to purchase the Companies and will not otherwise use it in their business or
otherwise. If this Agreement terminates, MasTec and Buyer agree to destroy
all Evaluation Material in either their possession or control or the

Companies whatsoever.

nor any of their Affiliates will, for a period of two years after the date

and its Representatives will not, and that such Seller will cause its

Buyer to contest the same or (b) made in connection with the enforcement of
any right or remedy relating to, or the performance of any obligation arising
under, this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. Each Seller agrees
that it will be responsible for any breach or violation of the provisions of
this _Section 5.1.1_ by any of its Representatives.

5.1.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller and each of its
Representatives may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any

Company;

professional and business contacts, on the other.

5.2.2 _Acknowledgement_. Each Seller acknowledges that the Companies conduct
business throughout the Territory. Accordingly, each Seller agrees that the
Territory is reasonable to protect the legitimate business interests of the
Buyer. Each Seller agrees that any reduction to the Territory would seriously
undermine the efficacy of this _Section 5.2_ and the protections that it is
intended to provide. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the covenants
contained in this _Section 5.2_ are essential elements of this Agreement and
that but for these covenants the Buyer would not have agreed to purchase the
Units. Each Seller further expressly agrees and acknowledges that (a) the
confidentiality, nonsolicitation and non-competition covenants contained in
this Agreement (i) are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the
Buyer with respect to the covenants respective stated purposes, time, scope
and geographic area, and are supported by adequate consideration; (ii) are
necessary for the protection of the Buyers legitimate business interests,
including the trade secrets, goodwill, and relationships with customers and
suppliers purchased by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii)
are not unduly restrictive of any rights of the Sellers; and (b) each Seller
has sufficient employment alternatives and sufficient assets, taking into
account the Purchase Price received and to be received by such Seller, such

impermissibly use 



 

-55-  either Companys confidential, proprietary, trade secret information
described in this Agreement during the term of this _Section 5.2_ in order to
earn a living. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2.7_, the existence of any
claim or cause of action against the Buyer by any Seller, whether predicated
on the Buyers breach of this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement by the Buyer of the covenants contained in this
_Section 5.2_.

5.2.3 _Injunction_. The Sellers agree that a violation of the terms,
provisions, covered obligations, duties and conditions described in this
_Section 5.2_ will cause irreparable damage to the Buyer for which money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly,
the Sellers acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by any Seller of any of their covenants or obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.2_, the Buyer shall be entitled, in any court in
the United States or otherwise having jurisdiction, to an injunction or
injunctions, without the posting of any bond, to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this _Section 5.2_, and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this _Section 5.2_ to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of this _Section 5.2_. Each Seller hereby agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
_Section 5.2_, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
_Section 5.2_ to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of each Seller under this
_Section 5.2_. The Sellers further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this  _Section 5.2.3_, the Buyer shall not in any respect
waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available under
this Agreement (including monetary damages), and (y) nothing set forth in this
_Section 5.2.3_ shall require Buyer to institute any Action for (or limit
Buyers right to institute any Action for) specific performance under this
_Section 5.2.3_ prior or as a condition to exercising any rights under
_Section 9_ or otherwise, nor shall the commencement of any Action pursuant
to this _Section 5.2.3_ or anything set forth in this _Section 5.2.3_
restrict or limit any partys right to pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available to Buyer thereafter.

5.2.4 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this  _Section 5_
shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, such
invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Agreement and the remaining provisions hereof shall remain in full force and
effect, to the extent permitted by Law, and any court of competent
jurisdiction may so modify the objectionable provision as to make it valid,
reasonable and enforceable. All parties hereto hereby agree that each and
every restrictive covenant as set forth in _Section 5.1.1_ and _Section
5.2.1(a)_ through and including _Section 5.2.1(e)_ is a separate and distinct
restrictive covenant, designated to operate under different factual
circumstances, and that the invalidity of one of said covenants shall not
affect the validity and/or enforceability of the other covenants.

5.2.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price Has No Effect_. Each Seller acknowledges
and agrees that a portion of the Purchase Price will be allocated (as set
forth on _Schedule 1.3_ )as consideration to the covenants set forth in this 
_Section 5.2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller acknowledges that
Buyer would not have entered into the Contemplated Transactions without the
covenants set forth in this _Section 5.2_; and if any covenant set forth
in this _Section 5.2_ is breached by 



 

-56-  any Seller, each Seller acknowledges and agrees that such allocation shall
not be deemed to be a measure of the damages that would result from such a
breach, and each Seller agrees that at no time shall he or it argue or in any
way assert in any Action that such consideration is a measure of the damages
resulting from such breach.

5.2.6 _"Related Entity"_. Solely for purposes of this _Section 5.2_, "
_Related Entity_ " means with reference to any Person, another Person
controlled by, under the control of or under common control with, that
Person. A Person shall be deemed to control another Person if the controlling
Person possesses, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management, policies and practices of the other Person,
whether through ownership of voting securities or otherwise. Without
limitation, any director, executive officer or beneficial owner of 50% or more
of the equity of a Person shall, for purpose of this Agreement, be deemed to
control the other Person.

5.2.7 _Default on Earn-Out Payments_. If Buyer fails to pay any Earn-Out
Payment when due and does not cure such failure to pay within 30 days after
the receipt of written notice from the Sellers Representative of such failure
to pay, then the restrictive covenants contained in  _Section 5.2_ will
terminate and be of no force and effect with respect to any Seller no longer
employed by Buyer or its Affiliates if Buyer thereafter fails to pay such
unpaid Earn-Out Payment on or prior to the 90th day after the end of such 30
day period. For clarity, a dispute regarding the amount of an Earn-out
Payment shall not in and of itself be a failure to pay an Earn-Out Payment
when due, as any disputed portion of an Earn-Out Payment shall not be due
until such time as the disputed amount is resolved in accordance with
_Section 1.10.6_, and any failure to make an Earn-Out Payment as permitted by
_Section 1.10.11_ or _Section 9.8_ shall not be a failure to pay an Earn-Out
Payment when due as no such payment is required at such time.

5.3 _Cooperation Regarding Financial Statements_. The Sellers shall use their
good faith efforts at Buyers cost and expense to assist and cooperate with
the efforts of the Buyer and its accountants and auditors to prepare and audit
any financial statements (including pro forma financial statements) that the
Buyer will be required to prepare, file or furnish pursuant to any applicable
securities laws or exchange requirements, including the 1933 Act, the Exchange
Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and any
rules or regulations of the New York Stock Exchange or other stock exchange,
or under any other applicable Laws.

5.4 _Litigation Support_. If and for so long as the Buyer or either Company
is actively contesting or defending against any Action in connection with any
fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction
existing or occurring on or prior to the Closing Date involving either
Company or Business, the Sellers will cooperate in the contest or defense and
provide such testimony as may be reasonably necessary in connection with the
contest or defense, at the cost and expense of the Buyer (unless and to the
extent the Buyer is entitled to indemnification therefor hereunder, in which
event such costs and expenses shall be borne by the Sellers).

5.5 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall
provide the Sellers and their advisors with reasonable access (for the
purpose of examining and copying at the Sellers expense) during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the books and records
relating to the Businesses prior to the Closing (the " _Books and Records_ ")
and, 



 

-57-  until the 36-month anniversary of the Closing, reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to the former
financial and accounting employees of the Businesses, in each case to the
extent necessary for the purpose of (a) compliance with tax requirements or
(b) providing information relating to Third Party Claims reasonably required
by the Sellers in order to satisfy their indemnification obligations pursuant
to this Agreement; provided, however, that such access shall not unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of the Buyer or its Affiliates
or the Businesses and shall be provided pursuant to the Buyers reasonable
confidentiality and security safeguards. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by the Sellers, the Buyer shall not destroy, alter or otherwise
dispose of any of the Books and Records in advance of the earlier of the
date of destruction or disposition pursuant to the Buyers document retention
policies or seven years following the Closing without first offering to
surrender to the Sellers such Books and Records or any portion thereof that
the Buyer may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

5.6 _LLC Indemnification Provisions_. Buyer agrees to cause each Company to
perform its obligations under such Companys Organizational Documents then in
effect to provide its members, officers, employees and agents with all rights
of indemnification thereunder and at least to the extent required by
applicable Law; provided, however, that none of MasTec, Buyer and the
Companies shall be required to indemnify any member, officer, employee or
agent in respect of any liability or obligation of such person to MasTec or
Buyer and which liability or obligation arises under this Agreement.

5.7 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_. Buyer shall cause Precision to
offer employment to the Transferred Employees, which offer shall be delivered
to the Transferred Employees prior to the Closing; and Sellers shall cooperate
with and shall make available to Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws, all information and documents as may be necessary to assist and
coordinate Precisions employment of the Transferred Employees. Buyer shall
cause Precision to offer such employees salary and bonus packages that are, in
the aggregate, substantially comparable to the salary and bonus packages in
place prior to the Closing. Precision shall cause the Transferred Employees to
be covered under the MasTecs benefit plans, arrangements or agreements and
shall provide such employees with credit for service with PPL thereunder for
purposes of eligibility and vesting. The Buyer shall waive any applicable
waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or actively-at-work requirements
(other than those under MasTecs 401(k) plan) and shall give the
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependants credit under the new
coverage or benefit plans for deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
payments that have been paid during the year in which such coverage or other
plan modification occurs. Within ten (10) days after the Closing, the Sellers
shall provide Buyer with a schedule that reflects those deductibles, co-
payments and out of those pocket payments. MasTec shall cause MasTecs 401(k)
plan (or the 401(k) Plan of Buyer or an Affiliate of MasTec) to accept
eligible rollover contributions from PPLs 401(k) plan from the Transferred
Employees who become participants in MasTecs 401(k) plan (or the 401(k) plan
of Buyer or an Affiliate of MasTec), subject to and conditioned upon Sellers
providing MasTec with evidence satisfactory to MasTec that the failures in
PPLs 401(k) Plan reflected on _Schedule 2.17(c)_ have been corrected, and
MasTecs otherwise being able to reasonably conclude in accordance with
Treas. Reg. §1.401(a)(31)-1 A-14, that such amounts would constitute valid
rollover contributions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (other than, for clarity, the Principals Employment
Agreements), nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer, MasTec or
either 



 

-58-  Company to retain any Transferred Employee for any period of time after the
Closing Date and subject to the requirements of applicable Law, Buyer, MasTec
and the Companies reserve the right, at any time after the Closing Date, to
terminate such employment and to amend, modify or terminate any terms or
conditions of employment, including any Employee Plan, program, policy,
practice or arrangement or the compensation or working conditions of the
Transferred Employees. MasTec and Buyer agree to cause Precision (i) to pay
the Transferred Employees 2009 bonuses in an amount of at least $500,000, (ii)
to pay field employees 2009 bonuses in an amount equal to at least
$2,000,000, (iii) to provide Transferred Employees with aggregate accrued
vacations with a value of at least $25,000 as of their date of hire, (iv) to
provide to the applicable employees 2009 profit sharing payments of at least
$200,000, and (v) to pay the stand-by-pay accrued as a current Liability in
the Actual Closing Balance Sheet.

5.8 _Warranty Repairs_. With respect to all warranty repairs that are
performed following the Closing Date by the Companies, but for which Sellers
are responsible pursuant to _Section 9.1.3_ or any other provision of
_Section 9_, Buyer agrees to cause the Companies to perform any such
warranty repair, and the Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect
to each such warranty repair, shall in all cases be equal to the sum of (a)
actual material cost, plus (b) actual labor cost, plus (c) actual fuel and
transportation costs, and plus (d) all other costs actually incurred by the
Companies, Buyer and their Affiliates in connection with such warranty repair.
This _Section 5.8_, except as set forth in the previous sentence with
respect to the determination of the amount of Losses, does not in any manner
alter Sellers obligations pursuant to _Section 9_ with respect to all such
warranty repairs.

 

5.9 _Workers  Compensation Insurance_. Effective upon the Closing, Buyer and
Precision shall cause the Zurich American Insurance Company workers
compensation insurance policy to be terminated. Sellers shall be responsible
for, indemnify and hold the Companies and Buyer harmless from any amounts due
Zurich American Insurance Company in respect of the termination of such
insurance policy. If Precision receives a refund or rebate as a retroactive
premium adjustment in respect of any amount of premium paid to Zurich American
Insurance Company for such insurance policy for 2009, Precision
shall immediately pay such refund or rebate to the Sellers in accordance with
_Schedule 1.2_ , such payment to be due within five (5) Business Days
thereafter.

5.10 _Lien Releases and Termination Statements_. Not later than the Closing
Date, Sellers shall procure the release of any liens and the filing of
termination statements in respect of each of the UCC financing statements
disclosed in Section C of _Schedule 2.9.1_.

_Buyer Indemnified Person_ "), from, against and in respect of any and all
Losses whether or not involving a Third Party Claim, incurred or suffered by

directly or indirectly relating to:

only to the extent required to be performed or complied with by such Company
at or prior to Closing;

9.1.3 any Liabilities (other than Liabilities under the Contractual
Obligations of the Company, except for Liabilities of the Companies or Sellers
of any kind or nature (i) the existence of which would conflict with or
constitute a breach of a representation, warranty or agreement of Sellers or
the Companies contained herein or (ii) by reason of or arising out of any
default or breach occurring prior to the Effective Date (or that would be a
default or breach but for the passage of time or giving of notice, or both)
or any unperformed, warranty repair obligation of the Companies that exists
prior to the Effective Date under such Contractual Obligations but that is
unperformed as of the Effective Date whether or not such Contractual
Obligation is disclosed on the Companies Disclosure Schedules) of the
Companies or the Sellers, of any nature whatsoever, whether accrued, absolute,

under this Agreement with respect to, or to hold the Buyer Indemnified
Persons harmless from, any claim or group of related claims, unless such claim
or group of related claims involves Losses in excess of $20,000 (a " _De
Minimis Claim_ "), nor shall any De Minimis Claim be applied to or considered
for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of the Buyer Indemnified
Persons Losses; provided that the limitations provided in this sentence shall
only apply with respect to an aggregate of up to $250,000 of De
Minimis Claims and if all De Minimis Claims in the aggregate exceed $250,000
(such excess, " _Excess De Minimis Claims_ "), the Sellers shall, subject to
the other limitations provided in this Agreement, indemnify and hold the Buyer
Indemnified Persons harmless from the amount of such excess over $250,000 and
the amount of such excess shall be applied to and considered for purposes of
calculating the aggregate amount of the Buyer Indemnified Persons Losses
needed to meet the Deductible and the Liability Cap. In addition, the Sellers
shall not be liable for the indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section
9.1.1_, _Section 9.1.3, Section 9.1.4_ or _Section 9.1.5_, or to hold

and _Section 9.1.5_ exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) excluding in
calculating such amount any De Minimis Claims but not Excess De Minimis Claims
(the " _Deductible_ "), after which the Sellers will be jointly and severally
responsible for all Losses, including Losses with 



 

-64-  respect to Excess De Minimis Claims, in excess of the Deductible up to a
maximum aggregate amount of Losses equal to Twenty-Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($22,500,000) (the " _Liability Cap_ "). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, (A) none of the De Minimis Claim limitation,
the Deductible or the Liability Cap will apply (i) in the case of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation or (ii) with respect to Sellers indemnification
obligations pursuant to _Section 9.1.2_, and (B) the Liability Cap will not
apply (i) with respect to any breach of _Sections 2.1_ (Organization and
Predecessors),  _2.2_ (Capitalization and Title), _2.3_ (Power and
Authorization), 2.5 (Noncontravention), _2.9.1_ (Ownership of Assets), _2.17_

(No Brokers) or (ii) with respect to Sellers indemnification obligations
pursuant to _Section 10_.

9.1.7 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for purposes
of determining whether there has been a breach and the amount of any Losses
that are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification or reimbursement
hereunder, each representation and warranty in this Agreement and schedules
and exhibits hereto shall be read without regard and without giving effect to
any Materiality Qualifier contained in such representation or warranty which
has the effect of making such representation and warranty less likely to be
breached (as if such word or words were deleted from such representation and
warranty).

9.2 _Indemnity by the Buyer and MasTec_. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this _Section 9_, from and after Closing, the Buyer and MasTec, jointly
and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and the Sellers

respect of any and all Losses incurred or suffered by Seller
Indemnified Persons or any of them as a result of, arising out of or relating
to, directly or indirectly:

9.2.1 any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
the Buyer and MasTec in _Section 3_; or

9.2.2 any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of the Buyer or
MasTec (including under this _Section 9_) or any covenant or agreement of the
Companies to the extent required to be performed or complied with by
the Companies after the Closing Date, in either case in or pursuant to this
Agreement.

9.3 _Time for Claims_. No claim may be made or suit instituted seeking
indemnification pursuant to _Sections 9.1.1_ or _9.2.1_ for any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty or _Section 9.1.3_ for any
Liability unless a written notice describing such breach or inaccuracy in
reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to the Indemnified
Person, is provided to the Indemnifying Person:

Authorization), _2.5_ (Noncontravention), _2.9.1_ (Ownership of Assets),

or intentional misrepresentation;

9.3.3 at any time prior to the ninetieth (90th) day after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account any tolling
periods and other extensions) in the case of any breach of, or inaccuracy in,
the representations and warranties set forth in _2.17_ (Employee Benefit
Plans), or _2.18_ (Environmental Matters); and

9.3.4 at any time prior to last day of the eighteenth (18th) month anniversary
of the Closing Date, in the case of any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any
other representation and warranty or any Loss arising from Liabilities
described in _Section 9.1.1_, _9.1.3_ or _9.2.1_ ; provided that if, at any
time prior to the expiration of the respective survival period set forth in
this _Section 9.3_ with respect to any particular representation or warranty,
any Indemnified Party delivers to any Indemnifying Party a written notice
alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or breach of such representation
or warranty and asserting a claim for Losses pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or
_Section 9.2_, then the representation or warranty underlying the claim
asserted in such notice and all indemnity obligations under this _Section 9_
related thereto shall survive until such claim is finally and fully resolved
in accordance with this Agreement.

Claims for indemnification pursuant to any other provision of _Sections 9.1_
and _9.2_ or pursuant to _Section 10_ are not subject to the limitations set
forth in this  _Section 9.3_.

9.4 _Third Party Claims_.

9.4.1 _Notice of Claim_. If any third party notifies an Indemnified Person
with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to
an Indemnity Claim against an Indemnifying Person under this _Section 9_,
then the Indemnified Person will promptly give written notice to the
Indemnifying Person; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no delay on the part of
the Indemnified Person in notifying the Indemnifying Person will relieve the
Indemnifying Person from any obligation under this _Section 9_ except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Person is actually prejudiced by the Indemnified
Partys failure to give such notice in such a timely manner.

9.4.2  _Assumption of Defense, etc_. The Indemnifying Person will be entitled
to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of
a notice given by the Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section 9.4.1_. In
addition, the Indemnifying Person will have the right to assume the defense
of the Indemnified Person against the Third Party Claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory (taking into account the jurisdiction in which the
claim is brought, the materiality of the claim and the experience levels and
other qualifications of counsel available to defend such claim) to the
Indemnified Person so long as (a) the Indemnifying Person gives written notice
to the Indemnified Person within fifteen days after the Indemnified Person
has given notice of the Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Person will
indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against the entirety of any and all
Losses the Indemnified Person may suffer resulting from, arising out
of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim, (b)
the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Person, (c) the
Indemnified Person has not been advised by counsel that an actual or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Person in connection with the defense of the 



 

-66-  Third Party Claim, (d) the Third Party Claim does not relate to or otherwise
arise in connection with Taxes (provided, that with respect to Taxes, this
_Section 9.4.2_ shall not affect the Sellers right to defend any claim of a
Governmental Authority as permitted by _Section 10.3.4(b)_) or any criminal
or regulatory enforcement Action and (e) the Indemnifying Person conducts the
defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently. The Indemnified
Person may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnifying Person will pay the fees and expenses of separate co-
counsel retained by the Indemnified Person that are incurred prior to the
Indemnifying Persons assumption of control of the defense of the Third Party
Claim.

9.4.3 _Limitations on Indemnifying Person_. The Indemnifying Person will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Person, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such judgment, compromise
or settlement (a) provides for the payment by the Indemnifying Person of
money as sole relief for the claimant, (b) results in the full and general
release of all Buyer Indemnified Persons or Seller Indemnified Persons, as
applicable, from all Liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection
with, the Third Party Claim and (c) involves no finding or admission of any
violation of Legal Requirements or the rights of any Person and has no effect
on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Person.

9.4.4 _Indemnified Person s Control_. If the Indemnifying Person does not
deliver the notice contemplated by clause (a) of _Section 9.4.2_ within 15
days after the Indemnified Person has given notice of the Third Party Claim,
or otherwise at any time fails to conduct the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently, the Indemnified Person may defend, and may
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim with the consent of the
Indemnifying Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld. If such notice and evidence is given on a timely
basis and the Indemnifying Person conducts the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently but any of the other conditions in _Section
9.4.2_ is or becomes unsatisfied, the Indemnified Person may defend, and may
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim with the consent of the
Indemnifying Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld. In the event that the Indemnified Person conducts the
defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 9.4.4_, the
Indemnifying Person will (a) advance the Indemnified Person promptly and
periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party Claim
(including attorneys fees and expenses) and (b) remain responsible for any
and all other Losses that the Indemnified Person may incur or suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by the
Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this _Section 9_.

9.4.5 _Reasonable Cooperation_. The party not in control of the prosecution or
defense of a Third Party Claim will reasonably cooperate with the other party
in the conduct of the prosecution or defense of such Third Party Claim.



 

-67- 9.5 _Sellers  Representative_. For purposes of this _Section 9_, it
is understood and agreed that the Sellers Representative shall act on behalf
of all Sellers.

9.6 _Knowledge and Investigation_. Except as provided in _Section 4.6_ or in
this _Section 9_, the right of any Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9_ will not
be affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, performance of or compliance with any covenant or
agreement, referred to in _Sections 9.1_ or _9.2_ , or otherwise.

9.7 _Remedies Cumulative_. The rights of each Buyer Indemnified Person and
Seller Indemnified Person under this _Section 9_ are cumulative, and each
Buyer Indemnified Person and Seller Indemnified Person, as the case may
be, will have the right in any particular circumstance, in its sole
discretion, to enforce any provision of this _Section 9_ without regard to
the availability of a remedy under any other provision of this _Section 9_.

9.8 _Right of Setoff_. Upon notice to the Sellers specifying in reasonable
detail the basis therefor and after the release of all amounts from the
Escrow Account or, if prior to such release, if Indemnity Claims are pending
for the full amount of the Escrow Account, the Buyer may set off any amount to
which it may be entitled (after taking into account the limitations
provided in this _Section 9_) from the Sellers against amounts otherwise
payable, if any, under _Section 1.10 _or _Section 9.1.5_. The exercise of
such right of setoff by the Buyer in good faith, whether or not
ultimately determined to be justified, will not constitute an event of
default under this Agreement or any other agreement between the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates and the Sellers. Neither the exercise or failure to exercise
such right of setoff will constitute an election of remedies or limit the
Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be
available to it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Buyer sets off an
amount pursuant to this _Section 9.8_ and it is later finally mutually
determined by the parties or pursuant to _Section 11.15_ that such setoff
amount was in excess of the amount which the Sellers were required to
indemnify the Buyer, then the Buyer shall pay interest to the Sellers on such
excess amount at the Prime Rate as published by the Wall Street Journal on the
date such setoff is made.

9.9  _Companies  Indemnification Obligations_. The obligation of the
Companies to indemnify Buyer and the other Buyer Indemnified Persons shall
terminate in all respects upon the Closing; provided that for the avoidance of
doubt the parties agree that the termination of the Companies
indemnification obligations pursuant to this _Section 9.9_ shall have no
effect on or in any way limit Buyers or any other Buyer Indemnified Persons
rights to indemnification from the Sellers, including Buyers and the other
Buyer Indemnified Persons rights to offset Losses that are incurred by or
imposed on Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Person against any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to _Section 1.10_. In addition, the Sellers
rights to seek contribution or payment of any amount from either Company for
any indemnification obligations that they are required to make to Buyer or any
other Buyer Indemnified Person shall also terminate in all respects upon the
Closing. If either Company suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any
Losses as a result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Companies or Sellers
hereunder, then (without limiting any of the rights of either Company, Buyer
or any other Buyer Indemnified Persons as Indemnified Persons) Buyer shall
also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the Equity Securities of the
Companies, to have incurred Losses as a result of and in connection with such
inaccuracy or breach but in any case the total amount both Buyer and the
Companies may recover shall not exceed the amount of Losses.



 

-68- 9.10 _Time of Payment of Claims_. Except as otherwise set forth in this 
_Section 9_, any amount owing by any Person pursuant to this _Section 9_
shall be paid within five (5) Business Days after determination of such
amount.

9.11 _Insurance and Other Sources of Reimbursement_. The amount of any Losses
for which indemnification is provided under this  _Section 9_ shall be
reduced by (i) the insurance proceeds received with respect to any such Losses
and (ii) any other amount, if any, recovered from third parties (as a result
of indemnification, contribution, guarantee or otherwise) by the Indemnified
Party (or its Affiliates) with respect to any Losses less in the case of (i)
and (ii) all reasonable costs of the Indemnified Party to collect such
proceeds and any increase in insurance premiums resulting from such recovery
(net of any reductions in such premiums which have occurred between the
Closing and the date of the underlying Claim, other than reductions which have
been previously fully offset pursuant hereto). For five years
following Closing, Buyer will cause the Companies to maintain the insurance
policies set forth on _Schedule 9.11_ ; provided, however, that Buyer may
terminate such insurance policies if it or any of its Affiliates provides
equivalent substitute coverage, either through individual policies or
MasTecs insurance program. If any Indemnified Party shall have been
indemnified in full pursuant to this _Section 9_ with respect to any Losses,
such Indemnified Party shall, assign to such Indemnifying Party (to the
extent of any indemnification payment received by the Indemnified Party) any
claim which such Indemnified Party may have under any applicable insurance
policy or other Contract which provides coverage for such Losses to the
extent of such indemnification payment. Such Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) to
collect under such insurance policy or other Contract; _provided_ , _however_
, that such commercially reasonable efforts shall not require any Indemnified
Party to litigate any insurance claim or assert any insurance coverage claim
that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of, or material
increase in the cost of, future coverage, or substantially reduce the
coverage available as a result of such claim. If any Indemnified Party shall
have received any indemnification payment from an Indemnifying Party pursuant
to this _Section 9_ with respect to any Losses and the Indemnified Party has
been indemnified in full with respect to such Losses (after application or
other insurance proceeds as set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph)
and has or shall subsequently have received insurance proceeds or other
amounts with respect to such Losses, which when added together with all other
insurance (less all reasonable costs of collection and any increase in
insurance premiums resulting from such recovery) and other proceeds
and indemnification amounts received is in excess of the amount of the Losses
(without reduction for insurance or other proceeds), then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party such excess, but not
in excess of the amount previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party.

9.12 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Payments received by any party pursuant to
this _Section 9_ shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes.



 

-69- 9.13 _Effect of Computation of Actual Net Working Capital_. Except for
payments of amounts owed pursuant to _Section 1.8_, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Buyer Indemnified Person shall
have any right to indemnification under _Section 9.1_ or _Section 10_
with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the extent of any Liability,
reserve or accrual included as a Current Liability in the Actual Closing
Balance Sheet or included as Actual Indebtedness pursuant to _Section 1.8_.

9.14 _Satisfaction of Indemnity Claims_. To the extent any amount is owed by
Sellers to any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to  _Section 9.1.1_, then
such amount will first be satisfied from the Escrow Account in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. To the extent the Escrow Account is
insufficient to satisfy all such amounts owed, any excess shall be satisfied
in cash via wire transfer or same day funds check.

9.15 _Limitations on Liability_.

9.15.1 If a breach of the representations, warranties and/or covenants given
by the Sellers in this Agreement is capable of remedy without Loss to Buyer,
the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to compensation if the
breach is not remedied within thirty (30) days after the date on which notice
is served on the Sellers Representative in accordance with _Section 9_.

9.15.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no party
shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of
this Agreement for any amount to the extent that such party has been
indemnified or reimbursed for such amount pursuant to this _Section 9_.

9.15.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if any
Losses for which Sellers are obligated to indemnify Buyer pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ arise in connection with or related to the work performed with
respect to any Enbridge Project (job numbers 09-043, 09-054, 09-085, 09-094,
09-097, 09-002, 09-004, 09-010, 09-053, 09-084 and 09-010) during the period
commencing July 1, 2009 and ending on the Effective Date, and any bonuses are
paid by Enbridge and received by either Company with respect to such project,
then Sellers obligation to indemnify Buyer for such Losses shall be reduced
(but not below zero) by an amount equal to the amount of such bonus received,
_multiplied_ by the percentage of the Enbridge Project completed between July
1, 2009 and the Effective Date.

9.16 _Exclusive Remedy_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, should the
Closing occur, except in the case of fraud, Buyer Indemnified Parties sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions (but, for clarity, excluding the
Company Agreements), whether based on contract, tort, strict liability,
other laws or otherwise, including any breach or alleged breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Section 9_ and _Section 10_
and, as applicable, the injunction provisions set forth in _Section 5.2.3_,
and hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action
(other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) it may have
against Sellers and their Affiliates arising under or based upon any Law or
otherwise relating to this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions.



 

-70- 9.17 _Allocation of Purchase Price Is Not Agreement of Losses_.
Notwithstanding the fact that MasTec, Buyer and Sellers have determined that
the Allocation reflects the fair market value of the respective categories of
the Companies Assets and the covenants set forth in _Section 5.2.1_, the
parties agree that the respective allocations among such categories and
covenants is not an agreement of the Losses that would be incurred by the
Buyer Indemnified Persons if any Seller breaches (a) any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein relating to any
category of Assets, or (b) such covenant. Each of the parties agrees that at
no time will such party argue or in any way assert in any Action that the
respective allocations among the categories of the Companies Assets and the
covenant set forth in _Section 5.2.1_ reflect the parties agreement of the
measure of Losses that would result from any breach of this Agreement.



   10. | TAX MATTERS 
---|--- 

10.1  _Representations and Obligations Regarding Taxes_. The Sellers jointly
and severally represent and warrant to and agree with Buyer as follows, in

to any joint venture, partnership or other arrangement or contract that could
be treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. Neither Company

provisions of foreign Law) or any safe harbor lease transaction. Neither
Company has acquired nor does it own any assets that directly or indirectly
secure any debt the interest on which is tax exempt under Section 103 of the
Code.

10.1.5 Each Company has been since its formation an eligible entity as

taxed as an association for federal, state or local income tax purposes. 

10.1.6 Except as set forth on _Schedule 10.1.6_ , neither Company shall be
required to include in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date taxable
income attributable to income that accrued in a prior taxable period but was
not recognized in any prior taxable period as a result of the installment
method of accounting, the completed contract method of accounting, the long-
term contract method of accounting, the cash method of accounting or Section

arrangement within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.62-2(c).

10.1.10 No Seller is a foreign person within the meaning of Section 1445 of
the Code.

10.2 _Covenants With Respect To Taxes_.

10.2.1 Buyer shall (i) grant to the Sellers Representative reasonable
access to the Companies books and records (including tax workpapers and
returns and correspondence with tax authorities), including the right to take
extracts therefrom and make copies thereof, to the extent that the books and
records relate to the operations of the Companies during taxable 



 

-72-  periods ending on or prior to or that include the Closing Date as may be
necessary for Tax Return preparation, audit, or other financial reporting
matters, and (ii) otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Sellers
Representative in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return
of the Company that the Sellers are responsible for and with any audit of
Taxes that relates to the Businesses of the Companies prior to the Closing
Date, in each case to the extent relevant to the Sellers indemnification
obligations under _Section 10.3_.

10.2.2 Buyer shall be responsible for preparing and filing, or causing the
Companies to prepare and file, all Tax Returns of the Companies required to be
filed for taxable periods ending after the Effective Date, or solely in the
case of income Tax Returns, the Closing Date, and the Sellers shall be
responsible, at their cost, for filing all Tax Returns of the Companies for
taxable periods ending on or before the Effective Date (" _Seller-Prepared
Returns_ "), or solely in the case of income Tax Returns, the Closing Date.
The Sellers shall furnish such Seller-Prepared Returns to the Buyer for its
review, comment and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) at least 30 days prior to the due date (or extended
due date) for filing such Tax Returns, and such Tax Returns shall be prepared
in accordance with past practice, except as required by Law. The
Sellers shall pay all Taxes required to be paid with respect to Seller-
Prepared Returns, except to the extent such Taxes have been previously paid,
deposited or accrued in Actual Net Working Capital on the Actual Closing
Balance Sheet. In the case of any Tax Returns other than income Tax Returns
(a " _Straddle Return_ ") for taxable periods which begin before the Effective
Date and end after the Effective Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), Buyer shall
furnish such Tax Returns to the Sellers Representative for its review,
comment and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) at least 30 days prior to the due date (or extended
due date) for filing such Tax Returns, and such Tax Returns shall be prepared
in accordance with past practice, except as required by Law. The Sellers shall
jointly and severally pay to Buyer within five (5) days after the date on
which Taxes are paid with respect to a Straddle Return approved by the
Sellers Representative or as to which the refusal of Sellers Representative
to approve is unreasonable an amount equal to the portion of those Taxes that
relates to the portion of the taxable period ending on the Effective Date
as determined pursuant to _Section 10.2.3_, reduced by the amount of the
accrual for those Taxes in Actual Net Working Capital on the Actual Closing
Balance Sheet.

10.2.3 For purposes of this Agreement, other than in the case of income Tax
Returns, in the case of any period that begins before the Effective Date and
ends after the Effective Date, any Tax based directly or indirectly on gross
or net income or receipts or imposed in respect of specific transactions and
any credits available with respect to any Tax, shall be allocated based on an
interim closing of the books by assuming that the taxable period ended on the
Effective Date, and any other Tax shall be allocated based on the number of
days in the taxable period ending on the Effective Date divided by the total
number of days in the taxable period. In the case of income Tax Returns,
Straddle Periods shall be based on the Closing Date rather than the Effective
Date.

10.2.4 No election shall be made to treat Buyer as an association for federal,
state or local income tax purposes. On or before the Closing Date, MasTec
shall furnish the Sellers Representative with copies of the Organizational
Documents relating to Buyer.



 

-73- 10.2.5 Buyer and MasTec hereby agree not to take any action or
filing position inconsistent with treating the Escrow Fund as installment
obligations under Section 453 of the Code.

10.2.6 Neither Buyer nor its Affiliates (including the Companies) may amend or
cause the amendment of a Tax Return of the Companies, or file or amend any Tax
election concerning the Companies, with respect to any period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date or any period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date, without the written consent of the Sellers Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

10.2.7 Any refund of Taxes of the Companies (including any interest with
respect thereto) attributable to any period occurring on or before the
Effective Date, or in the case of income Tax Returns, the Closing Date, or as
allocated pursuant to _Section 10.2.3_ shall be the property of the Sellers,
shall be paid promptly to the Sellers Representative and, if received by
Buyer or its Affiliate (including the Companies), shall be payable promptly to
the Sellers Representative.

10.2.8 Buyer shall not permit, and shall cause its Affiliates not to permit,
the Companies to take any actions on the Closing Date that are out of the
ordinary course of business of either Company, except as required or
contemplated by this Agreement.

10.3 _Indemnification for Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (in particular _Section 9_):

10.3.1 The Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the Companies (each herein sometimes
referred to as an " _Buyer Indemnified Taxpayer_ " and together with Sellers,
each an " _Indemnified Taxpayer_ ") against, and agree to jointly and
severally protect, save and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnified Taxpayer
from, any and all claims, damages, deficiencies and losses and all expenses,
including reasonable attorneys, accountants and experts fees and
disbursements (all herein referred to as " _Tax Losses_ "), resulting from:

(a) a claim by any Governmental Authority for any Taxes, except to the extent
such Taxes have been previously paid, deposited, or accrued in Actual Net
Working Capital on the Actual Closing Balance Sheet, allocable to any period
ending on or prior to the Effective Date, or in the case of income Taxes, the
Closing Date, or allocable pursuant to _Section 10.2.3_ to that portion of
any Straddle Period ending on the Effective Date, or in the case of income
Taxes, the Closing Date, of (A) either the Companies or the Sellers and (B)
any corporation that is or was a member of an Affiliated Group of which such
Company was or is a member, or any liability of any of the foregoing for the
Taxes of any Person, whether as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise;

(b) a claim by any Governmental Authority for any Taxes arising from the sale
of the Units pursuant to this Agreement;



 

-74- (c) any breach of any representation, warranty or obligation set forth
in this _Section 10;_

(d) any Taxes owing in respect of item 3 on _Schedule 10.1.1_.

10.3.2 _Tax Gross Up_.

(a) On or prior to February 28, 2010, MasTec shall pay to Sellers as
additional cash consideration for the purchase of the Units (the " _Gross-Up
Payment_ ") the amount determined pursuant to this _Section 10.3.2_. The
Gross-Up Payment shall be equal to (i) the excess of (x) the federal, state
and local income Tax of the Companies and the Sellers resulting from the
operations of the Companies and the Contemplated Transactions computed for
the period beginning on January 1, 2009 through and including the Closing Date
(the " _Closing Period_ ") minus (y) the federal, state and local income Tax
of the Companies and the Sellers resulting from the operations of the
Companies and the Contemplated Transactions for the period commencing on
January 1, 2009 through and including the Effective Date (the " _Stub Period_
"), (for this purpose (1) including the taxable income or loss and deduction
of Precision from Global Pipeline Partners, LLC (" _GPP_ ") as if the transfer
of the interest in GPP were as of the end of each of the Closing Period and
the Stub Period, (2) taking into account the Tax basis increases as a result
of the allocation of the taxable income of the Companies for such periods in
calculating the gain on the sale of the Units hereunder, (3) treating the
Closing Date or the Effective Date, as the case may be, as the end of a Tax
year; and (4) the Tax shall be determined in accordance with past practice and
Precision GAAP, except as otherwise required by Law,) (the " _Closing Period
Tax_ "),  _divided_ by (ii) the percentage equal to the excess of (a) 100%
_minus_ (b) the sum of the maximum federal and Wisconsin capital gain tax rate
for long-term capital gain applicable to an individual resident of
Wisconsin applicable to receipt of the Gross-Up Payment, net of applicable
federal deduction for the Wisconsin capital gain tax. On or before January 31,
2010, Sellers shall calculate or cause to be calculated the amount of the
Closing Period Tax and furnish a copy of such calculation (the " _Closing
Period Tax Calculation_ ") and such other workpapers as MasTec shall
reasonably request to MasTec for review. In the event that the parties do not
agree on the computation of the Gross-Up Payment or the Closing Period Tax,
the dispute shall be resolved in the same manner as provided in _Section
1.8.3_. The Sellers agree that GPP may elect to "close the books" as of the
Closing Date for purposes of Section 706(d) of the Code and, in that event,
the items of income, gain, loss and deduction of GPP for the Tax year in which
the Closing Date occurs shall be allocated between the Sellers and MasTec in
accordance with the close the books method. MasTec agrees to reasonable
cooperate with Sellers to cause GPP to adopt the closing of the books
allocation method.

(b) In the event that a Governmental Authority makes a claim that is settled,
compromised or otherwise resolved in a final, non-appealable manner that has
the effect of increasing the net taxable income of the Companies for the
Closing Period, MasTec shall pay to Sellers for the purchase of the Units
additional cash consideration computed in accordance with the provisions of
this _Section 10.3.2_, including the interest, but not any penalties with
respect to such additional Tax.



 

-75- (c) This _Section 10.3.2_ assumes that Closing occurs in 2009. If the
Closing Date occurs after December 31, 2009, then the parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to revise this _Section 10.3.2_ consistent with the
parties intent that the Sellers are to be made whole by MasTec with
respect to income Taxes for the period from the Effective Date through the
Closing Date, taking into account any Tax benefits from the payment of such
Taxes.

10.3.3 Subject to the resolution of any Tax contest pursuant to _Section
10.3.4_, upon notice from Buyer to the Sellers Representative or Sellers
Representative to Buyer, as the case may be, that an Indemnified Taxpayer is
entitled to an indemnification payment for a Tax Loss pursuant to _Section
10.3.1_ or _Section 10.3.2_, the indemnifying party thereupon shall pay (or
in the case of multiple indemnifying parties, they shall jointly and
severally pay) to the Indemnified Taxpayer an amount that, net of any Taxes
imposed on the Indemnified Taxpayer with respect to the payment and net of any
Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Taxpayer resulting from the
Tax Loss, will indemnify and hold the Indemnified Taxpayer harmless from the
Tax Loss. Any indemnity payment under this _Section 10.3.3_ shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes. 

10.3.4 _Tax Contests_.

(a) If a claim with respect to Taxes (a " _Tax Claim_ ") shall be made by any
Governmental Authority that, if successful, would result in the
indemnification of an Indemnified Taxpayer, the Indemnified Taxpayer shall
notify the Sellers Representative or Buyer, as the case may be, in writing
(and, in any event, within thirty (30) days of the receipt of notice of any
such Tax Claim), but any failure to give the notice will not waive any rights
of the Indemnified Taxpayer, except to the extent the indemnifying party or
parties have suffered actual prejudice thereby.

(b) The indemnifying party or parties shall have the right to defend the
Indemnified Taxpayer against the claim with counsel of its or their choice so
long as (A) with respect to a claim that does not relate to a Straddle Period,
the indemnifying party notifies or indemnifying parties notify the Indemnified
Taxpayer in writing within 15 days after the Indemnified Taxpayer has given
notice of the claim that the indemnifying party will or indemnifying parties
will jointly and severally indemnify the Indemnified Taxpayer from and against
the entirety of any Tax Losses the Indemnified Taxpayer may suffer resulting
from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the claim
(except to the extent that the claim relates to Taxes that have been
previously accrued in Actual Net Working Capital on the Actual Closing Balance
Sheet), and (B) the indemnifying party or indemnifying parties conduct the
defense of the claim actively and diligently. 



 

-76-  With respect to any Tax Claim, the indemnifying party or parties shall have
the right to control and defend, with counsel of its or their choice at its or
their expense, such Tax Claim (and all proceedings taken in connection
therewith) and, without limiting the foregoing, may pursue or forego any and
all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
applicable representatives of a Governmental Authority with respect thereto,
and may, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law
permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner;
provided, however, that the indemnifying party or parties will consult
with the Indemnified Taxpayer in the negotiation and settlement of any Tax
Claim, and the indemnifying party or parties will not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Taxpayer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld), settle or compromise any Tax Claim in any
manner if such settlement or compromise would have the effect of increasing
the Taxes of the Indemnified Taxpayer. To the extent that a Tax Claim relates
to a Straddle Period, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer will jointly
control all proceedings taken in connection with any such Tax Claim, and
neither Sellers Representative nor the Buyer or its Affiliate will settle or
compromise a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of the Company for a Straddle
Period without the other partys or parties written consent which consent
shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld. The Indemnified
Taxpayer will cooperate with the indemnifying party or parties in contesting
any Tax Claim, which cooperation will include the retention and (upon the
indemnifying partys or parties request) the provision to the indemnifying
party or parties of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

10.3.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations under this _Section 10_ shall survive the
Closing until the 90th day following the end of the applicable statutes of
limitations.

10.3.6 All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be jointly and severally paid by the
Sellers when due, and the Sellers will, at their expense, file all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all the transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if
required by applicable Law, Buyer will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join
in the execution of any of those Tax Returns and other documentation.

Each of the parties to this Agreement may specify a different address or
facsimile number by giving notice in accordance with this _Section 11.1_ to
each of the other parties hereto.

11.2 _Sellers  Representative_.

11.2.1 _Appointment_. " _Sellers  Representative_" means Murphy and Rooney;
provided, that in the event of either Murphys or Rooneys death, resignation
or physical or mental incapacity to act as the Sellers Representative, "
_Sellers  Representative_" shall mean the survivor. Each Seller hereby
irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Sellers Representative as such
Sellers attorney-in-fact and agent to act in such Sellers name, place and
stead in connection with all matters arising from and under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement, each of the Company Agreements and any other agreements,
documents or instruments related to the Contemplated Transactions and
acknowledges that such appointment is coupled with an interest.
Sellers Representative hereby accepts such appointment and authorization.

11.2.2 _Authority_. Each Seller agrees to be bound by all notices received or
given by, and all agreements and determinations made by, and all documents
executed and delivered by the Sellers Representative under this Agreement;
authorizes the Sellers Representative to assert claims, make demands and
commence actions on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement, dispute or to
refrain from disputing any claim made by the Sellers, negotiate and compromise
any dispute that may arise under, and exercise or refrain from exercising
remedies available to the Sellers under, this Agreement, and to sign any
releases or other documents with respect to such dispute or remedy (and to
bind the Sellers in so doing), give such instructions and do such other things
and refrain from doing such things as the Sellers Representative shall deem
appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, give any and all
consents and notices under this Agreement, and perform all actions, exercise
all powers, receive service of process with respect to any Action under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Company Agreement and any other agreement
or instrument in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, agree to,
negotiate and authorize payments in connection with the Escrow Fund, the
Purchase Price Adjustment, the Earn-Out Payments and any other payment
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and fulfill all duties otherwise
assigned to the Sellers Representative in this Agreement. Each Seller hereby
expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers Representative has the
sole and exclusive authority to act on such Sellers behalf in respect of all
matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement after execution of
this 



 

-79-  Agreement, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among them, and that
no Seller shall have any authority to act unilaterally or independently of the
Sellers Representative in respect to any such matter. Buyer, the Companies
(after the Closing) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any and
all actions taken by the Sellers Representative under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement without any Liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any
of the Sellers. All notices, counter notices or other instruments or
designations delivered by any Seller in regard to this Agreement shall not be
effective unless, but shall be effective if, signed by the
Sellers Representative, and if not, such document shall have no force or
effect whatsoever, and Buyer, the Companies (after the Closing), the Escrow
Agent and any other Person may proceed without regard to any such document.

11.2.3 _Change of Representative_. The Sellers Representative may be changed
by the Sellers upon not less than twenty (20) calendar days prior written
notice to Buyer; provided, that the Sellers Representative may not be removed
unless Sellers who held a majority of the Units agree to such removal and to
the identity of the substituted agent or agents. The Sellers Representative
may resign at any time upon not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior
written notice to Buyer, but in any event, not prior to the appointment of a
substitute Sellers Representative. No bond shall be required of the Sellers
Representative. Notices or communications to or from the Sellers
Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Sellers.

11.2.4 A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative,
including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement, shall
constitute a decision of the Sellers and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Sellers; and Buyer may conclusively and absolutely, rely,
without any inquiry, upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Sellers Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Sellers. Buyer is hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person,
including any Seller, for any acts done by it in accordance with or reliance
on such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative.

11.2.5 All notices or other communications required to be made or delivered
by Buyer to the Sellers shall be made to the Sellers Representative for the
benefit of the Sellers, and any notices so made shall discharge in full all
notice requirements of Buyer to the Sellers with respect thereto. All notices
or other communications required to be made or delivered by the Sellers to
Buyer shall be made by the Sellers Representative for the benefit of the
Sellers, and any notices so made shall discharge in full all notice
requirements of the Sellers to Buyer with respect thereto.

11.3 _Publicity_. No public announcement or disclosure will be made by any
party with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions without the prior written consent of the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this _Section
11.3_ will not prohibit (a) any disclosure required by any applicable Legal
Requirements, including any disclosure necessary or desirable to provide
proper disclosure under the securities laws or under any rules or regulations
of any securities exchange on which the securities of such party may be listed
or traded or (b) any disclosure made in connection with the enforcement of any
right or remedy relating to, or the performance of any obligation arising
under, this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.



 

-80- 11.4 _Succession and Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiary_. Subject to
the immediately following sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, each of which such successors and permitted assigns will be
deemed to be a party hereto for all purposes hereof. No party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder (other than transfers by operation of law)
without the prior written approval of the other parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Buyer may (a) assign any or all of its rights and
interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates and (b) designate one or
more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such assignment or designation shall not relieve Buyer of its
obligations hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in _Section 9_ with
respect to Indemnified Persons who are not parties to this Agreement, this
Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties and their permitted
successors and assignees and nothing herein expressed or implied will give or
be construed to give any Person, other than the parties and such successors
and assignees, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

11.5 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by the Buyer and the Sellers Representative, or
in the case of a waiver, by the party or parties against whom the waiver is
to be effective. No waiver by any party of any breach or violation or, default
under or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent breach, violation, default of, or inaccuracy in, any such
representation, warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No delay or
omission on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or remedy
under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof.

11.6 _Further Assurances_. From and after the date hereof, upon the request
of the Sellers Representative or the Buyer, each party will do, execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments,
transfers, conveyances and other instruments and papers as may be reasonably
required or appropriate to carry out the Contemplated Transactions. No Seller
will take any action that is designed or intended to have the effect of
discouraging any lessor, licensor, supplier, distributor or customer of
either Company or other Person with whom such Company has a relationship from
maintaining the same relationship with such Company after the Closing as it
maintained prior to the Closing.

11.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Company Agreements, the Buyer
Confidentiality Agreement and the other agreements and documents to be
executed and delivered pursuant hereto or contemporaneously herewith
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior and contemporaneous
discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and
agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto.



 

-81- 11.8 _Schedules; Listed Documents, etc_. Neither the listing nor description
of any item, matter or document in any Disclosure Schedule hereto nor the
furnishing or availability for review of any document will be construed to
modify, qualify or disclose an exception to any representation or warranty of
any party made herein or in connection herewith, except to the extent that
such representation or warranty specifically refers to such Disclosure
Schedule or a reasonable person would be reasonably likely to conclude that a
matter disclosed on a Disclosure Schedule is also responsive to a matter
required to be disclosed on another Disclosure Schedule. The inclusion of any
information in any Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission
or evidence of the materiality of such item. In addition, matters reflected
in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature. The information contained in this
Agreement, in the Disclosure Schedules, and exhibits hereto is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any Person
other than the parties hereto of any matter whatsoever (including any
violation of Law or breach of contract).

11.9 _Counterparts; Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement will
become effective when duly executed by each party hereto. Facsimile or other
electronically scanned and transmitted signatures shall be deemed originals
and shall constitute valid execution and acceptance of this Agreement by the
signing/transmitting party.

11.10 _Survival_. The covenants and agreements and, subject to  _Section
9.3_, the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall
survive and remain in effect after the Closing.

11.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If any provision hereof would, under
applicable Law, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, then each party
hereto intends that such provision will be construed by modifying or limiting
it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with,
and possible under, applicable Law.

11.12 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience
purposes only and will not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation
hereof.

11.13 _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. The parties intend that each representation,
warranty and covenant contained herein will have independent significance. If
any party has breached or violated, or if there is an inaccuracy in, any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the
party has not breached or violated, or in respect of which there is not an
inaccuracy, will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party has
breached or violated, or there is an inaccuracy in, the first representation,
warranty or covenant. 



 

-82- 11.14 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the rights of the parties and all
Actions arising in whole or in part under or in connection herewith, will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that
would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

11.15 _Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process_.

11.15.1 _Jurisdiction_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 5.2.3_, each
party, by its execution hereof, (a) hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of Florida or the
United States District Courts located in the Southern District of Florida for
the purpose of any Action between the parties arising in whole or in part
under or in connection with this Agreement, (b) hereby waives to the extent
not prohibited by applicable law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion,
as a defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that any such
Action brought in one of the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds
of _forum non conveniens_ , should be transferred or removed to any court
other than one of the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the
pendency of some other proceeding in any other court other than one of the
above-named courts, or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may
not be enforced in or by such court and (c) hereby agrees not to commence any
such Action other than before one of the above-named courts. Notwithstanding
the previous sentence a party may commence any Action in a court other than
the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or
judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.

11.15.2 _Venue_. Each party agrees that for any Action between the parties
arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement, such
party will bring Actions only in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Each party
further waives any claim and will not assert that venue should properly lie in
any other location within the selected jurisdiction.

11.15.3 _Service of Process_. Each party hereby (a) consents to service of
process in any Action between the parties arising in whole or in part under
or in connection with this Agreement in any manner permitted by Florida law,
(b) agrees that service of process made in accordance with clause (a) or made
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address
specified pursuant to _Section 11.1_, will constitute good and valid service
of process in any such Action (including, with respect to each Seller that
notice need only be given to the Sellers Representative) and (c) waives and
agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any
such Action any claim that service of process made in accordance with clause
(a) or (b) does not constitute good and valid service of process.

11.16 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL
NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, 



 

-83-  WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS
PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND
BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHICH ACTION WILL INSTEAD
BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A
JURY.

11.17  _Expenses_. Except as provided in _Sections 1.8.3_ , _1.10.6_ ,
_4.3.2_ , _9_ or _10_ , each party shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions; provided
that Sellers shall bear all Closing Date Seller Expenses, and no Closing Date
Seller Expenses will be included in the Actual Closing Balance Sheet.

11.18 _Specific Performance_. Buyer shall have the right and remedy, in
addition to any others that may be available, at law or in equity, to have the
provisions of this Agreement specifically enforced through injunctive or
other relief, without the necessity of posting a bond, it being acknowledged
that each Company is a unique asset, with value to Buyers business not
readily quantifiable and any breach by Sellers and/or either Company which
causes the Closing not to occur will cause irreparable injury to Buyer, the
amount of which will be difficult to determine, and that money damages will
not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer. The Sellers and the Companies
covenant and agree that they shall not, and shall not authorize any other
Person to, challenge or question the enforceability of any provision of this
_Section 11.18_.

11.19 _Spousal Consent_. Each of Mrs. Murphy and Mrs. Rooney acknowledges and
agrees as follows:

11.19.1 THAT SHE IS AWARE THAT SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO SEEK INDEPENDENT LEGAL
COUNSEL RELATIVE TO HER RIGHTS AFFECTED BY THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO SIGNING
THIS AGREEMENT;

11.19.2 that she is aware of the fact that the "Wisconsin Marital Property
Law" governs the property rights of married persons in Wisconsin. Under the
Wisconsin Marital Property System, each spouse has a 50% ownership interest in
property acquired during marriage resulting from the efforts of either or
both spouses (specifically excluding gifted or inherited property which shall
be the individual property of the receiving spouse);

11.19.3 that she has read and understands this Agreement, having been given
reasonable opportunity to inquire relative to the same; and

11.19.4 that she consents to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

11.20 _Joint and Several_. The covenants, agreements, obligations and
Liabilities of the Companies, the Sellers, the Sellers Representative, Mrs.
Murphy and Mrs. Rooney hereunder and under each agreement or other document
executed in connection herewith, whether on the date hereof, the Effective
Date, the Closing Date or at any other time shall be joint and several in
all 



 

-84-  respects. The covenants, agreements, obligations and Liabilities of MasTec
and the Buyer hereunder and under each agreement or other document executed in
connection herewith, whether on the date hereof, the Effective Date, the
Closing Date or at any other time shall be joint and several in all respects.
Where in this Agreement or any agreement or document referred to in the
preceding sentence, provision is made for any action to be taken or not to be
taken by any of the Companies, the Sellers, the Sellers Representative Mrs.
Murphy or Mrs. Rooney the Sellers agree to cause such Persons to take or not
to take such action and shall be jointly and severally Liable for
such Persons taking or not taking any such action, as the case may be. Where
in this Agreement or any agreement or document referred to in the preceding
sentence, provision is made for any action to be taken or not to be taken by
Buyer, MasTec agrees to cause Buyer to take or not to take such action and
shall be jointly and severally Liable for Buyer taking or not taking any such
action, as the case may be.

11.21 _Legal Representation_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
understands that Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP is representing PPL, Steven R.
Rooney, and Michael Daniel Murphy and no other party hereto. In any
proceeding by or against any Seller wherein any Seller asserts or prosecutes
any claim under, or otherwise seeks to enforce, this Agreement, or any other
agreement executed or to be executed in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, any claim is asserted against any Seller, or this
Agreement or any other agreement executed or to be executed in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions is sought to be enforced against any Seller,
Buyer and MasTec agree in connection with such proceeding (a) that neither
they nor their counsel will move to seek disqualification of Gardere Wynne
Sewell LLP, (b) to waive any right they may have to assert the attorney-client
privilege against Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP with respect to any communication
or information contained in Gardere Wynne Sewell LLPs possession or files and
(c) to consent to the representation of the Sellers by Gardere Wynne Sewell
LLP. This consent and waiver extends to Gardere Wynne Sewell LLPs
representing the Sellers against Buyer and MasTec in litigation, arbitration
or mediation in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions.

11.22 _Disclaimer_. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLERS AND THE
COMPANIES DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY, OR
IMPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERESTS, ANY COMPANY, OR ANY OF THE ASSETS, AND
EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLERS HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY
AND ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERESTS,
ANY COMPANY, OR ANY ASSETS, SUCH DISCLAIMER INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OR
REPRESENTATION (EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED) AS TO: (I) THE CONDITION OF THE
ASSETS, (II) FITNESS OF THE ASSETS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, (III) THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION FURNISHED TO BUYER OR ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, ADVISORS OR CONSULTANTS BY THE COMPANIES, SELLERS, SELLERS
AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING ANY INFORMATION IN ANY "DATA ROOM" OR
"VIRTUAL DATA ROOM," ANY PROJECTIONS AND ANY INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
