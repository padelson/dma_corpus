<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <I>Paying Agent. </I>Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company to act as agent for payment of the Merger Consideration (the <I>&#147;Paying Agent&#148;</I>)
upon surrender of the Common Stock Certificates and the Preferred Stock Certificates (collectively,
the &#147;<I>Certificates</I>&#148;). Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Sections&nbsp;2.1(c) and 2.1(d) upon surrender of Certificates.
Parent shall replenish the Payment Fund to the extent of any investment losses incurred through any
investment made pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(g). Such funds provided to the Paying Agent are referred
to herein as the &#147;<I>Payment Fund.</I>&#148;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <I>Payment Procedures. </I>Promptly (but in any event within five (5)&nbsp;Business Days) after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i)&nbsp;a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which
shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
(and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which
the shares of Company Common Stock or Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Sections&nbsp;2.1(c) or 2.1(d), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock or Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration.
No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article&nbsp;II shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock or
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock previously represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on
the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock or Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to Section&nbsp;2.2(e), if, at any time
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving

or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond,

investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 270&nbsp;days

properly paid from the Payment Fund or delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

government or other investment grade securities, in each case, maturing in not more than one year,
or other investments of comparable liquidity and credit-worthiness as directed by Parent. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall be the property of, and shall be
paid promptly to, Parent.

the event appraisal rights are available under the DGCL, Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by any holder who has not voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for
such shares pursuant to, and has complied in all respects with, the provisions of Section&nbsp;262 of
the DGCL (the &#147;<I>Dissenting Shares</I>&#148;) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its rights to
appraisal or it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal rights in accordance with
the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its
right to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal rights, such
shares (and, in the case of Company Common Stock, associated Company Rights) shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable Law.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, unless and to the extent required to do
so under applicable Law.

Time (whether or not then vested and exercisable) shall be canceled and terminated and (except to
the extent Section&nbsp;3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule specifies that no payment will be made
with respect to a particular Option) converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the
Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Company Option.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the Company
Stock Plans and give any notices required under the Company Stock Plans and obtain all consents
that, in each case, are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section&nbsp;2.3 and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, payment may be withheld in respect of
any Option until any necessary consents are obtained. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound
by any Options, stock appreciation rights, or other agreements which would entitle any Person,
other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to
receive any payment in respect thereof (other than the payment of Option Consideration pursuant to
this Section&nbsp;2.3). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
terminate all its Company Stock Plans, such termination to be effective at or before the Effective

(i)&nbsp;the Common Stock Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (ii)&nbsp;the exercise
price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Option. For
purposes of clarity, any Company Option with a per-share exercise price that is greater than or
equal to the per-share Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be canceled and terminated as of the
