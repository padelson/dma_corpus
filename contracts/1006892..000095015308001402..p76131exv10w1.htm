 WHEREAS, Parent has approved, and the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub have adopted, approved and declared advisable, this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the _"Merger"_ ), on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition to and inducement of Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, executive officers, directors and a stockholder of the Company set forth on _Schedule A_ are entering into voting undertakings in substantially the forms attached as _Exhibit A_ (each, a " _Voting Agreement_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Any shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub (in each case, other than shares held on behalf of third parties), shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)), together with the Company Rights attached thereto or associated therewith, shall be converted into the right to receive $14.86 in cash, without interest (the _"Common Stock Merger Consideration"_ ).

 Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent for payment of the Merger Consideration (the _"Paying Agent"_ ) upon surrender of the Common Stock Certificates and the Preferred Stock Certificates (collectively, the " _Certificates_ "). Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Sections 2.1(c) and 2.1(d) upon surrender of Certificates. Parent shall replenish the Payment Fund to the extent of any investment losses incurred through any investment made pursuant to Section 2.2(g). Such funds provided to the Paying Agent are referred to herein as the " _Payment Fund._ " 

   

 (b) _Payment Procedures._ Promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock formerly represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Sections 2.1(c) or 2.1(d), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

   

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock previously represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving 

    ##### 

  

  

 _Execution Copy_  

  

Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay the Merger Consideration to such Person in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Fund._ Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 270 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (f) _No Liability._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid from the Payment Fund or delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (g) _Investment of Payment Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund in U.S. government or other investment grade securities, in each case, maturing in not more than one year, or other investments of comparable liquidity and credit-worthiness as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall be the property of, and shall be paid promptly to, Parent. 

   

 (h) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.1, any shares of Company Common Stock or, in the event appraisal rights are available under the DGCL, Series B Preferred Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such shares pursuant to, and has complied in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its rights to appraisal or it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal rights, such shares (and, in the case of Company Common Stock, associated Company Rights) shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, unless and to the extent required to do so under applicable Law.

 Section 2.3 _Company Stock Plans_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Company Option, each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested and exercisable) shall be canceled and terminated and (except to the extent Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule specifies that no payment will be made with respect to a particular Option) converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Company Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the Company Stock Plans and give any notices required under the Company Stock Plans and obtain all consents that, in each case, are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3 and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, payment may be withheld in respect of any Option until any necessary consents are obtained. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound by any Options, stock appreciation rights, or other agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof (other than the payment of Option Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.3). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate all its Company Stock Plans, such termination to be effective at or before the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, _"Option Consideration"_ means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Common Stock Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Option. For purposes of clarity, any Company Option with a per-share exercise price that is greater than or equal to the per-share Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be canceled and terminated as of the Effective Time, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto or in respect thereof. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the outstanding shares of restricted stock held under restricted stock agreements to vest in accordance with the terms of such agreements. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any RSU, each RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the RSU Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the RSU. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary, including without limitation obtaining all necessary consents, to provide that each RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested) shall be cancelled and terminated and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the RSU Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the RSU, free of any restriction or risk of forfeiture.

business and, to the extent applicable in such jurisdiction, is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the

Company Material Adverse Effect: (1) any change, event, occurrence or state
of facts relating to the global, U.S. or regional economy, financial markets,
political conditions in general, or the industry in which the

instructions of Parent or as otherwise expressly required to be taken by the
Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (4) in
and of itself, any change in the Companys stock price or trading volume or
any failure to meet internal projections or forecasts or published revenue or
earnings projections of industry analysts (provided that this clause (4)
shall not be construed as providing that the change, event, occurrence or
state of facts giving rise to such change or failure does not constitute or
contribute to a Company Material Adverse Effect); (5) any stockholder class
action litigation arising from allegations of breach of fiduciary duty
relating to the Agreement; and (6) any change, event, occurrence or state of
facts arising out of any change in GAAP or applicable accounting requirements

 (c) The Company has established and maintains (i) disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports and (ii) internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to provide assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment
outstanding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, as of the

excess of $100,000 individually or $250,000 in the aggregate or (z) would

The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms of all Permits, and all such Permits are in full force and effect, except where such suspension or cancellation would not be reasonably expected to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) No event or condition has occurred or exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses or accelerations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No such suspension, cancellation, violation, breach, default, loss of a benefit, or acceleration of an obligation will result from the Transactions, except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses or accelerations that would not be reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 (d) Each Domestic Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code is so qualified and (ii) any trusts intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code are so exempt. Nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of such Domestic Benefit Plans that could cause the loss of such tax favored treatment, qualification or exemption, or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or Tax under ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law that, if corrected under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System, could reasonably be expected to give rise to a material liability.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code that would subject any Person to tax pursuant to Section 409A of the Code based upon a good faith interpretation of all applicable regulations, notices and regulatory guidance.

 Section 5.3 _No Solicitation by the Company; Etc_. 

  

 (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, _"Representatives"_ ) to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries non-officer employees to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Takeover Proposal. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and the Company shall not knowingly authorize or permit its Representatives to, and shall not knowingly authorize or permit its and its Subsidiaries non-officer employees to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or providing assistance) any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to or otherwise cooperate with or assist, any third party regarding any Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal or (iv) enter into any letter of intent or agreement related to

 _Execution Copy_  

  

any Takeover Proposal; _provided, however,_ that if after the date hereof the
Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made
after the date hereof and the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) of
the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel (i) that such Takeover Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead
to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable law, then the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval), (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal, but only after
such Person is a party to or enters into a customary confidentiality
agreement with the Company (which confidentiality agreement must be no less
favorable to the Company in any material respect (i.e., no less restrictive
with respect to the conduct of such Person) than the then applicable terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement) and which shall permit the Company to comply
with the terms of this Section 5.3, _provided_ that (1) such confidentiality
agreement may not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to
negotiate with the Company and (2) the Company advises Parent of all
such non-public information delivered to such Person concurrently with its
delivery to such Person and concurrently with its delivery to such Person the
Company delivers to Parent all such information not previously provided to
Parent, (B) participate in discussions and negotiations with such
Person regarding such Takeover Proposal (including solicitation of a revised
Takeover Proposal) and (C) enter into the confidentiality agreement
contemplated by clause (A) of this proviso. The Company shall take all action
necessary to enforce, and shall not waive or amend, each confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound (in each case, other
than any such agreement with Parent);  _provided, however,_ that the Company
may waive any standstill or similar agreement and permit a proposal to be
made if the Board (or committee thereof) determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duty under applicable law. The Company shall
provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of any confidentiality
agreement entered into pursuant to this paragraph within 24 hours of
the execution thereof. 

   

 (b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.3, the Company shall promptly advise Parent no later than twenty-four hours after receipt by an officer or director of the Company, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is initially received by, any information is initially requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall notify Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly (within twenty four hours) keep Parent informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations. 

   

 (c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(c), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) qualify, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, or propose publicly to qualify, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or 

    ##### 

  

     

 _Execution Copy_  

  

propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, or cause or authorize the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture
agreement or other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement in accordance with Section 5.3(a)) (each, a
_"Company Acquisition Agreement"_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, prior to the time that the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained (but in no event after obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval) (x) the Board of Directors of the Company (or
committee thereof) may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of
Directors (or committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under the applicable law, and, with respect to
any recommendation of a Takeover Proposal, the Board (or committee thereof)
determines in good faith that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and (y) if the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written
Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors (or committee
thereof) determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board
of Directors (or committee thereof) may, in response to such Superior
Proposal after the expiration of the three business day period described
below, cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal but only if the Company shall have concurrently with
entering into such definitive agreement terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii) and prior thereto or concurrently therewith paid the
Termination Fee required pursuant to Section 7.3, but in any event only after
the third business day following Parents receipt of written notice (the
_"Notice"_ ) from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of
the Company (or any committee thereof) is prepared to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement
(it being understood that the Company shall be required to deliver a
new Notice in respect of any revised Superior Proposal (other than immaterial
revisions) from such third party or its Affiliates that the Company proposes
to accept, attaching the most current version of such agreement to such
Notice and the other information required by Section 5.3(b) (which
information shall be updated on a current basis), and only if at the end of
such three business day period, after taking into account any revised terms
as may have been proposed by Parent in writing (and not withdrawn) since its
receipt of such Notice, the Board of Directors of the Company (or committee
thereof) has again in good faith made the determination referred to above in
this clause (y). 

   

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement: 

    

 _"Takeover Proposal"_ means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) equal to 20% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the Companys consolidated revenues on a consolidated basis for the then preceding four completed and publicly reported calendar quarters are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of 20% or more of the Company

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; in each case, other than the
Transactions. 

   

 _"Superior Proposal"_ means an unsolicited, written Takeover Proposal made by a third party, which is on terms and conditions which the Board of Directors of the Company (or committee thereof) determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Financial Advisor or another financial advisor of national reputation) to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view (taking into account all terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and financial terms, and the ability of the Person making such proposal to consummate the transactions contemplated by such proposal, based upon, among other things, the availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining required approvals) than the Merger and the other Transactions, taking into account at the time of determination any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed by Parent in writing (and not withdrawn), except that the reference to "20 _%_ " in the definition of " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall be deemed to be a reference to " _50%_ ". 

  

 (e) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act if such Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of outside counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or the approval of this Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company, Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement to the extent set forth in Section 7.1(c)(iii) of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.4 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to, and the Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, enter into any consent decree, make any divestiture, accept any operational restriction or take or commit to take any action that would reasonably be expected to limit: (i) the freedom of action of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to the operation of, or Parents ability to retain, the Company or any businesses, product lines or assets of the Company, or (ii) Parents or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates ability to retain, own or operate any portion of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or alter or restrict in any way the business or commercial practices of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries (any such event, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.4 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or (ii) so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.4.

 Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify the individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company (collectively, the _"Indemnitees"_ ) with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by (A) the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (B) any applicable contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (C) applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnitee for such Indemnitees criminal conduct or fraud. 

   

 (b) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees (as defined to mean those persons currently insured under the Companys directors and officers insurance and 

    ##### 

  

     

 _Execution Copy_  

  

indemnification policy) with an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the
_"D andO Insurance"_) that is no less favorable than the existing policy or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided, however,_ that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for such insurance, _provided, further,_ that if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Surviving Corporation may fulfill its obligation to provide
insurance under this Section 5.8(b) by obtaining a prepaid "tail" policy of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and condition which
are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to the insured than the existing
policy, and maintaining such "tail" policy in full force and effect for a
period of at least six (6) years. 

   

 (c) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.8 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8. The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives. 

   

 (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8. 

   

 Section 5.9 _Securityholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 Section 5.10 _Fees and Expenses._ Whether or not the Merger is consummated, and except as otherwise contemplated under Section 7.3 of the Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that Company and Parent shall share equally (a) the filing fee of Parents pre-merger notification report under the HSR Act and all fees and expenses incurred by Parent or Company in seeking approvals under all other applicable Antitrust Laws, and (b) all fees and expenses, other than accountants and attorneys fees, incurred with respect to the printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including any related preliminary materials) and any amendments or supplements thereto).

    ##### 

  

     

 _Execution Copy_  

  

or wages and annual bonus opportunities) and employee benefits that are
comparable to the pay and benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent or its Affiliates, provided that for such purposes of this
covenant, stock options and other equity awards shall be disregarded. 

   

 (b) Continuing Employees shall also be provided credit for all service with the Company and its subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such Continuing Employees, under (i) all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and fringe benefits (other than stock option and other equity award programs) arrangements to be provided to such employees for purposes of eligibility and vesting, (ii) severance plans, programs and policies to be provided to such employees for purposes of calculating the amount of each such employees severance benefits and (iii) vacation and sick leave plans, programs and policies for purposes of calculating the amount of each such employees vacation and sick leave, except, in each case, as would result in a duplication of benefits. With respect to each employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent or its Subsidiaries that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, and without regard to whether ERISA applies thereto) in which Continuing Employees participate following the Effective Time, Parent or its Subsidiaries shall cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations. In addition, to the extent permissible under the terms of such plan, if the effective time at which a Continuing Employee participates in any such plan falls within an annual period of coverage under such plan, each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for covered expenses paid by that Continuing Employee and his or her dependents under comparable Company plans during the applicable coverage period through such effective time toward satisfaction of any annual deductible limitation and out-of-pocket maximum that may apply under that plan of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and either shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, discharge the obligations under each employment, severance or retention agreement (including the establishment and funding of any related rabbi trust) listed in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 5.11 shall impede or limit Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from terminating any of their employees at any time for any reason or no reason, subject to the provisions of applicable Law. 

   

 (e) Effective no later than the last day of the payroll period immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company and its ERISA Affiliates, as applicable, shall each terminate any and all plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (collectively, the " _401(k) Plans_ ") unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that any 401(k) Plan shall not be so terminated. Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than seven (7) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Parent (i) copies of duly adopted resolutions by the Companys Board of Directors authorizing the termination of such 401(k) Plans and (ii) with respect to each 401(k) Plan, an executed amendment to the 401(k) Plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan shall be maintained at the time of termination. The form and substance of such resolutions and amendment shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent.

 (f) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Section 5.11 and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Plan for any purpose. 

   

 Section 5.12 _Convertible Notes_. Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger will constitute a "Fundamental Change," as such term is defined in Indenture dated as of November 23, 2005 (the " _Indenture_ ") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company N.A., as successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as Trustee (the " _Trustee_ "). 

  

 (a) As soon as possible, after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall enter into a supplemental indenture with the Trustee in form agreed to by Parent (the " _Supplemental Indenture_ ") to be effective at the Effective Time. The Supplemental Indenture shall, among other things, amend the Indenture to remove the Indenture Covenants (as defined in the Consent and Conversion Agreement). 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practical after the date hereof, the Company shall provide to each holder of the outstanding Convertible Notes a Consent and Conversion Agreement, in the forms agreed to by Parent and the Company and substantially similar to the Consent and Conversion Agreement dated as of even date herewith between the Company and Highbridge International LLC, (together, the " _Consent and Conversion Agreements_ "). The Consent and Conversion Agreements shall provide, among other things, (i) for the payment upon conversion of a Note of the sum of the Conversion Obligation, the Consent Premium (both as defined in the Consent and Conversion Agreement), accrued but unpaid interest on such Convertible Notes and the Make Whole Premium (as defined in the Indenture) (together, the " _Conversion Price_ ") for such Note, (ii) the acknowledgement and agreement of such holders to the removal and deletion of each of the Indenture Covenants from the Indenture effective automatically upon the conversion of such holders Convertible Notes, and (iii) for the sale of the Warrants held by such holder to the Company effective as of the Effective Time for the price for the Warrants set forth in the applicable Consent and Conversion Agreement. The Company shall ensure that the price paid for any Note shall not exceed the Conversion Price for such Note. The conversion of the Convertible Notes (and any payments in connection with such conversion) shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary upon consultation with Parent to obtain the Supplemental Indenture and to complete the conversion of the Convertible Notes surrendered pursuant to the Consent and Conversion Agreements. The Company shall not, without the consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Consent and Conversion Agreements or make any changes to the Consent and Conversion Agreements other than as agreed between Parent and the Company. 

   

 (c) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare all other necessary and appropriate documentation required by the Indenture in connection with the transactions contemplated herein (collectively, the " _Note Documents_ "), and such Note Documents shall comply as to form and substance with applicable legal requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirements under the Indenture.

The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its and their
reasonable commercial efforts to have its and their Representatives to

Notes. All Note Documents and mailings to the holders of the Convertible Notes
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein shall be subject to
the prior review and comment by each of the Company and Parent and shall be
reasonably acceptable to each of them. 

   

 (d) Following the Closing and to the extent any Convertible Notes remain outstanding, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and discharge the obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture in accordance with the terms thereof, including the giving of any notices and making of any payments that may be required in connection with any repurchases or conversions of Convertible Notes occurring as a result of such Fundamental Change, and the Company shall assist Parent and the Surviving Corporation in assuming such obligations of the Company. 

   

 Section 5.13 _Warrants._ Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger will constitute a "Change of Control," as such term is defined in the Warrants. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all commercially reasonable actions to provide for the (i) Companys purchase of the Warrants at the Effective Time for the price for the Warrants set forth in the applicable Consent and Conversion Agreement, (ii) the cancellation of all the outstanding Warrants effective upon the Effective Time and (iii) all such other action that Parent may reasonably request, including the giving of any notices, in connection with any purchases of the Warrants in connection with such Change of Control in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 Section 5.14 _Debt Financing_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitment, including commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitment, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitment or consistent in all material respects with the Financing Commitment, and (iv) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice (A) of any material breach by any party of the Financing Commitment of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (B) if and when Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware that any portion of the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment will not be available to consummate the Transactions and (C) of any termination of the Financing Commitment. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of their efforts to arrange the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing and provide to the Company copies of executed copies of the definitive documents related to the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing (excluding any fee letters, engagement letters or other agreements that are confidential by their terms). If the Financing Commitment shall expire or terminate for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain, and will promptly provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for an amount of financing sufficient to consummate the transactions

contemplated hereby and other terms and conditions the aggregate effect of
which is not materially adverse to Parent in comparison with those contained
in the Financing Commitment as originally issued (an " _Alternate Financing_
"). Any Alternate Financing may be made by the Lenders or other lenders that
are parties to the Financing Commitment as originally issued or another
bona fide lender or lenders acceptable to the Parent. Parent shall accept any
such commitment letter if the funding conditions and other terms and
conditions contained therein are not materially adverse to Parent in
comparison with those contained in the Financing Commitment as originally
issued. 

   

 (b) The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to provide on a timely basis, such reasonable assistance and cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment (or Alternate Financing, as applicable) as may be reasonably requested by Parent, _provided, however_ , that no such requested cooperation may unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include (i) making senior management of the Company reasonably available for customary lender meetings and "roadshow" presentations and cooperating with prospective lenders in performing their due diligence, (ii) providing due diligence materials to the parties to the Financing Commitment or other potential financing sources (including pursuant to an Alternate Financing) (iii) furnishing all financial statements and financial and other information that are customarily prepared by the Company and reasonably required in connection with such Debt Financing or Alternate Financing, as applicable, (iv) assisting Parent and its debt financing sources in the preparation of, and executing, if applicable, an offering document and definitive transaction documents for such Debt Financing or Alternate Financing, as applicable, and materials for rating agency presentations, (v) cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its debt financing sources for such Debt Financing or Alternate Financing, as applicable, (vi) providing such other documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection therewith, and (vii) facilitating the pledge of collateral (including the release of any Liens on the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries) to secure the Debt Financing or Alternate Financing, as applicable, at and after the Closing; _provided_ , that that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the Effective Time and none of the Company or any Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing or Alternate Financing, as applicable, prior to the Closing. 

   

 Section 5.15 _Inventions Assignment._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each employee and independent contractor listed on Schedule 3.15(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule a fully executed written agreement in a form acceptable to Parent providing that all Company Intellectual Property developed by such Persons is owned exclusively by the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no failure to have obtained such fully executed agreements from such employees and independent contractors prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute a failure of the condition to the Merger set forth in Section 6.2(b). 

  

 Section 5.16 _Product Review_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall respond promptly to Parents reasonable requests for information concerning the Companys use of Open

 Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if subject matter jurisdiction in the such court is not available, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedy available to the Company set forth in Section 7.3.

The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto.
