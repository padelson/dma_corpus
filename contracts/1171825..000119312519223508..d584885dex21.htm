kind and description of Seller Bank existing as of the Effective Time of the
Merger, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)(3)_.

receive, in the aggregate for all such shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ ",
which shall consist of the following two components:

 



\- 16 -

         | (A) |

an amount in cash equal to (i) the Closing Date Cash Consideration, plus (ii)

Consideration_ "); and 

---|---|--- 



     | (B) |

at the option of Purchaser Bank, a number of shares of Purchaser Parent Common
Stock equal to (i) the Stock Consideration Value, divided by (ii) the volume
weighted average price per share of the Purchaser Parent Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange for the twenty (20) trading days prior to the
announcement of the transaction as found on Bloomberg (such shares, the "
_Stock Consideration_ "). 

---|---|--- 

(2) All of the shares of Seller Bank Common Stock converted into the right to
receive, in the aggregate for all such shares, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and the certificates previously representing any such shares of Seller Bank
Common Stock shall thereafter represent, collectively, only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be retired and cancelled.

(b) Purchaser Bank shall notify Seller Parent of the number of shares of

for a different number or kind of shares or securities in any such case as a
result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in
capitalization, the Stock Consideration shall be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted to give the Seller the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

\- 18 -

    

2.05 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent
shall deliver to Purchaser Bank the Determination Date Balance Sheet and a
certificate based on the Determination Date Balance Sheet setting forth Seller
Parents calculation of the Determination Date Tangible Equity, prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles. Seller Parent shall
afford Purchaser Bank and its Representatives the opportunity to review all
work papers and documentation used by Seller Parent and its accountants in
preparing the Determination Date Balance Sheet and Seller Parents calculation
of the Determination Date Tangible Equity. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the Closing Date Cash Consideration, which will be paid by Purchaser Bank
at the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.04_, shall reflect the
Determination Date Balance Sheet and Seller Parents calculation of the
Determination Date Tangible Equity.

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser Bank shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Seller Parent a proposed final consolidated balance sheet of Seller Bank
(excluding the Excluded Subsidiaries) as of the Effective Time (the "
_Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and a certificate based on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet setting forth Purchaser Banks calculation of the Closing Date
Tangible Equity and any adjustments to the Determination Date Balance
Sheet and Determination Date Tangible Equity that Purchaser Bank deems
necessary (such certificate and the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the " _True-Up
Statement_"). The True-Up Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. Purchaser Bank shall afford Seller Parent and its
Representatives the opportunity to review all work papers and
documentation used by Purchaser Bank and its accountants in preparing the
True-Up Statement.

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the True-Up Statement
shall be final and binding on the parties hereto, unless, within thirty (30)
days after receipt by Seller Parent of the True-Up Statement, Seller Parent
shall notify Purchaser Bank in writing of its disagreement with any amount
included therein or omitted therefrom (each dispute, an " _Objection_ ").
Seller Parent and Purchaser Bank shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Objection. If the parties are unable to resolve the Objections within fifteen
(15) Business Days of the receipt by Purchaser Bank of such notice, Seller
Parent and Purchaser Bank shall submit all matters that remain in dispute with
respect to the Objection to a nationally recognized independent accounting
firm selected by mutual agreement between Seller Parent and Purchaser Parent
as set forth on _Schedule B_ , or such other nationally recognized independent
accounting firm agreed upon by Seller Parent and Purchaser Bank (the "
_Accounting Referee_ "). The Accounting Referee, acting as an expert and not
as an arbitrator, shall be instructed to resolve the matters that remain in
dispute with respect to the Objection based solely on written submissions of
Purchaser Bank, on the one hand, and Seller Parent, on the other hand, and
not by independent investigation. The Accounting Referees calculation (i)
must be made in accordance with the standards and definitions in this
Agreement, and (ii) with respect to each item in dispute, such
determination shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower,
of the amounts advocated by Seller Parent in the Objection or by Purchaser
Bank in the True-Up Statement with respect to such disputed line item. The
Accounting Referees determination shall be made within fifteen (15) Business
Days of engagement, to the extent reasonably practicable. Purchaser Bank and
Seller Parent shall afford the Accounting Referee the opportunity to review
all work papers and documentation used by Purchaser Bank and Seller Parent
and their respective accountants in preparing the Determination Date Balance
Sheet and the True-Up Statement, to the extent necessary to resolve all
Objections. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto with respect to the calculation of the
unresolved matters specified in the Objection. The Accounting Referee shall
allocate its costs and expenses between Seller Parent and Purchaser Bank
based upon the percentage of the Objections submitted to the Accounting
Referee that is ultimately awarded to Seller Parent on the one hand or
Purchaser Bank on the other hand.

 



\- 19 -

    

(d) Not later than the close of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day
following the final determination of the True-Up Statement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_ (the " _Adjustment Payment Date_ "), (1) if the
Closing Date Tangible Equity Adjustment Amount is a positive number,
Purchaser Bank shall effect the transfer of cash, in immediately available
funds, to Seller equal to the Closing Date Tangible Equity Adjustment Amount,
and (2) if the Closing Date Tangible Equity Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, Seller shall effect the transfer of cash, in immediately available
funds, to Purchaser Bank equal to the Closing Date Tangible Equity Adjustment
Amount; provided, that any payment made pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
2.05(d)_ following the Adjustment Payment Date shall be made together with
interest thereon computed from the Adjustment Payment Date up to, but not
including, the date of such payment at the rate of three month LIBOR, as
published on Bloomberg (or any market accepted alternative rate should such
LIBOR rate be discontinued), calculated on a 365-day basis.

 

(e) Any adjustments provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ shall be
deemed, for purposes of Taxes, to be adjustments to the Purchase Price. To
the extent any fact, condition or development directly results in an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_, no claim
for indemnification under  _Article_ __ _ VI_ shall be made by a party in
respect of such direct adjustment (it being understood that the foregoing
shall not preclude any claim for indemnification under _Article_ __ _ VI_ for
Losses incurred by either party, directly or indirectly, resulting from,
related to or arising out of any such fact, condition or development, other
than to the extent it directly results in a direct adjustment to the Purchase
Price).

 

(f) For clarity, the Determination Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date
Balance Sheet shall not reflect (i) the payment or accrual by Seller Parent
of fees and expenses incurred (or estimated to be incurred) by Seller Parent
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including all fees
payable to Seller Parents financial advisor, legal counsel, and
accountants) and (ii) the payment or accrual by Seller Bank of any vendor or
funding termination or breakage penalties relating to Contracts that have been
terminated at the request of Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Bank. If the
Closing Date Cash Consideration is reduced by an Employee Retention Plan
Adjustment Amount in respect of amounts payable under the Employee Retention
Plans (other than the Change in Control Plan) that were not accrued on the
Determination Date Balance Sheet, to the extent that any such amounts are
thereafter accrued on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Date
Tangible Equity shall not reflect such accrual to the extent the amount has
previously resulted in an Employee Retention Plan Adjustment Amount. 

2.06 _Tax Treatment_.

 

Purchaser Parent, Seller Parent and Seller acknowledge and agree that the
Merger will be treated for U.S. income Tax purposes as a taxable sale of all
of the assets of Seller Bank to Purchaser Bank in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and the assumption by Purchaser Bank of Seller Banks
Liabilities (including the Liabilities, if any, to which Seller Banks assets
are subject and to the extent treated as consideration for Tax purposes).

ARTICLE III

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

 

3.01 _Disclosure Schedules_.

On or prior to the date of this Agreement, Seller Parent has delivered to
Purchaser Parent a schedule (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "), and
Purchaser Parent has delivered to Seller Parent a schedule (the " _Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule_ ") setting forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which is either in response to an express disclosure requirement
contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ or
_Section_ __ _ 3.03_ (as the case may be) or to one or more of the covenants
contained in _Article_ __ _ IV_.

 

3.02 _Representations and Warranties of Seller Parent, Seller and Seller
Bank_.

 

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller Parent, Seller
and Seller Bank represent and warrant to Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank,
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing (except to the extent
made only as of a specified date, in which case as of such date), that:

 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Authority_.

 

(1) Each of Seller Parent, Seller, Seller Bank and their respective
Subsidiaries, (A) is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (B) has all corporate (or other
entity) power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now conducted and (C) is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign entity and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction where the
character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

(2) True, complete and correct copies of the Constituent Documents of Seller
Bank and its Subsidiaries, each as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have been made available to Purchaser Parent.

(3)  _Section_ __ _ 3.02(a)(3)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true, complete and correct list of each jurisdiction where Seller Bank and
its Subsidiaries are organized and qualified to do business.

 

(b) _Capital Structure_.

 

(1) The authorized capital stock of Seller Bank consists of 500,000 shares of
Seller Bank Common Stock, of which 100,000 shares are issued and outstanding
and none of which are held in treasury as of the date of this Agreement. All
the issued and outstanding shares of Seller Bank Common Stock have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (except as
provided in 12 U.S.C. §55). Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Seller Bank Common Stock and has good and marketable title to such
shares of Seller Bank Common Stock, free and clear of any and all Liens
(other than restrictions on transfer which arise under applicable Securities
Laws, this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents). Seller Bank has no
preferred, trust preferred or subordinated debt securities or other similar
capital securities issued or outstanding.

(2) There are no outstanding or authorized Rights that would require Seller
Bank or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, sell or otherwise cause to become
outstanding any of its capital stock. Neither Seller Bank nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any commitment to authorize, issue or sell any shares
of capital stock or other equity interests, and there are no shares of
capital stock of Seller Bank or any of its Subsidiaries authorized or reserved
for issuance. None of Seller Banks or any of its Subsidiaries issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock are subject to, or have been issued in
violation of, any preemptive rights. No bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which the holders of
capital stock may vote (" _Voting Debt_ ") have been issued by Seller Bank or
any of its Subsidiaries and are outstanding. None of Seller Parent, Seller,
Seller Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party to any voting
trust, proxy or other agreement or understanding with respect to the voting
of any capital stock of Seller Bank or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) _Subsidiaries_.

 

(1) _Section_ __ _ 3.02(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list, as of the date hereof, of (a) each direct and
indirect Subsidiary of Seller Bank, including its jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation and (b) each other Person that is not a Subsidiary
but in which Seller Bank holds, directly or indirectly, a 5% or greater
equity interest, other than the Variable Interest Entities (each, a "
_Minority Interest Business_ "), and in each case the number of equity
interests held, directly or indirectly, by Seller Bank in such Subsidiary
or Minority Interest Business, as the case may be, and the percentage of
Seller Banks direct or indirect equity interest in such Subsidiary or
Minority Interest Business, as the case may be, relative to all outstanding
equity interests (on a fully diluted basis). All the outstanding shares of
capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests of each Seller
Bank Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid
and non-assessable and are not subject to any preemptive or similar rights.
All of the shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests of each
Subsidiary and Minority Interest Business that are owned, directly or
indirectly, by Seller Bank or a Seller Bank Subsidiary thereof are free and
clear of all Liens (other than restrictions on transfer which arise under
applicable Securities Laws, this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents). Except for (x) the capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, Seller Banks, set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.02(c)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule and (y) Seller Banks interests in the
Minority Interest Businesses, neither Seller Bank nor any of its Subsidiaries
owns, directly or indirectly, any 5% or greater equity, membership interest,
partnership interest, or joint venture interest in any Person, or any interest
convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for, any of the foregoing. No
Subsidiary of Seller Bank has any preferred, trust preferred or subordinated
debt securities or other similar capital securities issued or outstanding.

 

(d) _Corporate Authorization_.

 

(1) Each of Seller Parent, Seller and Seller Bank has all necessary corporate
(or other entity) power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Seller Parent, Seller
and Seller Bank, and the consummation by Seller Parent, Seller and
Seller Bank of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized and
approved by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller Parent,
Seller and Seller Bank and no other corporate (or other entity) proceedings on
the part of Seller Parent, Seller and Seller Bank are necessary to approve
this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Seller Parent, Seller and Seller Bank and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser Parent and
Purchaser Bank, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller
Parent, Seller and Seller Bank, enforceable in accordance with its terms
(except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of
equity or by principles of public policy).

 



\- 22 -

    

(2) No vote of the policyholders of Seller Parent or the holders of any other

Seller Disclosure Schedule and (B) such other consents, approvals, or filings

(2) Subject to the receipt of the approvals and consents referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 3.02(e)(1)(A) and (B)_ and the expiration of applicable
waiting periods, the execution, delivery and performance by each of Seller
Parent, Seller and Seller Bank of the Transaction Documents to which it is a
party and the consummation by it of the Transactions do not (A) constitute a
violation or breach of or default under or give rise to (or give rise after
the giving of notice, the passage of time or both) a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation of Seller Parent, Seller or
Seller Bank or to a loss of any benefits to which Seller Parent, Seller or
Seller Bank is entitled under any provision of (i) Seller Parents, Sellers
or Seller Banks Constituent Documents; (ii) any Law applicable to Seller
Parent, Seller or Seller Bank, other than immaterial violations of Law; or
(iii) any Material Contract to which Seller Parent, Seller or Seller Bank is
a party or any license, franchise, permit or similar authorization held by
Seller Parent, Seller or Seller Bank, in the case of clause (iii), other than
violations, breaches, defaults, rights or loss which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect; or (B) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than

warrant to Seller Parent and Seller, as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing (except to the extent made only as of a specified date, in
which case as of such date), that:

(a) _Organization, Standing and Authority_.

entity) power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to

business as a foreign entity and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction where the
character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

(2) True, complete and correct copies of the Constituent Documents
of Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank, each as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, have been made available to Seller Parent.

(b)  _Capital Structure_.

validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Purchaser Parent has no trust
preferred or subordinated debt securities or other similar capital securities
issued or outstanding.

 



\- 41 -

outstanding any of its capital stock. Purchaser Parent does not have any
commitment to authorize, issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other
equity interests, and there are no shares of capital stock of Purchaser
Parent authorized or reserved for issuance. None of Purchaser Parents issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock are subject to, or have been issued in
violation of, any preemptive rights. No Voting Debt has been issued by
Purchaser Parent and is outstanding. Purchaser Parent is not a party to any
voting trust, proxy or other agreement or understanding with respect to the
voting of any capital stock of Purchaser Parent.

 

(c) _Corporate Authorization_. Each of Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank has
all necessary corporate (or other entity) power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank and the consummation by Purchaser Parent
and Purchaser Bank of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized
and approved by all necessary corporate (or other entity) action on the part
of Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank and no other corporate (or other
entity) proceedings on the part of Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Bank are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Purchaser Parent and
Purchaser Bank and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Seller Parent, Seller and Seller Bank, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank, enforceable in accordance
with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general
principles of equity or by principles of public policy). The shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration, if any,
will have been validly authorized if and when issued, will be validly issued,

Purchaser Parent will have any preemptive right or similar rights in respect
thereof.

be satisfied if the Closing were to then occur or (2) that results or would
reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such party to comply with

(including any condition set forth in _Article_ __ _ V_) to be complied with

release or public statement or make any other such public disclosure without
the prior consent of Purchaser Parent or Seller Parent, as the case may be,

prohibit Purchaser Parent or Seller Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from making any disclosure necessary, based on the advice of
legal counsel (which may be internal counsel), in order to satisfy its
disclosure obligations imposed by Law, any stock exchange, or any other self-
regulatory organization, or upon request of a Governmental Authority, after
making reasonable efforts under the circumstances to consult with the non-

and other facilities, and to the Contracts, Seller Bank Books and Records and

third party in effect on the date of this Agreement (if Seller Parent, Seller
or Seller Bank shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to have
obtained the consent of such third party to such disclosure), (ii) result in
the loss of any attorney-client privilege or other privilege held by such
party or (iii) contravene any Law, in which case the Seller Parent, Seller
Bank or Seller, as applicable, will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements and (B) the distribution or receipt of any information made
available under this _Section_ __ _ 4.05_ shall not affect any other rights
of the parties under this Agreement.

applicable subsections of _Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_, this _Section_ __ _
4.07_ shall not apply to any controlled Affiliate of either party if such

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the covenants in this  _Section_ __ _
4.07_ have been made in order to induce the parties to enter into and

consummate the Transactions without the agreement of the other party to the
covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.07_. The parties hereto further
acknowledge that this _Section_ __ _ 4.07_ constitutes an independent

other provision of this Agreement. In the event that any of the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 4.07_ should ever be adjudicated and found by a final
determination of a court or any other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction to exceed the time, scope, geographic, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be
deemed reformed in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, scope, geographic
or other limitations enforceable under applicable Law in a means that comes
closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable provision,
in order to render the restrictive covenants set forth in this  _Section_ __
_ 4.07_ enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Each
party further acknowledges that a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 4.07_
would cause immeasurable injury to the other party and that, in the event of
a breach by such party or its controlled Affiliates of this _Section_ __ _
4.07_, the other party will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly,
in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to
seek such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available to restrain the
breaching party and its controlled Affiliates from the violation of the
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction and injunctive
relief without the necessity of posting a bond or proving special damages.
Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as prohibiting any party from
pursuing any other remedies available at law or equity for such breach,
including the recovery of damages.

4.08 _Employee Non-Solicitation_.

(a) neither Seller Parent nor any of its controlled Affiliates shall, directly

the Surviving Bank and its Subsidiaries) shall, directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment any employees of Seller Parent or its Affiliates with
whom Purchaser Parent or its Affiliates have had substantial contact in
connection with the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
foregoing restriction shall not apply to the solicitation of (1) any such
Persons whose employment has been terminated by Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates, (2) any such Persons who have ceased to be employed by Seller
Parent or its Affiliates for the six (6) month period prior to the applicable
soliciting or (3) any such Persons who respond to general solicitations of
employment through advertising media not specifically directed toward

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the covenants in this  _Section_ __ _
4.08_ have been made in order to induce the parties to enter into and
consummate the Transactions and that each such party would not enter into and
consummate the Transactions without the agreement of the other party to the
covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.08_. The parties hereto further
acknowledge that this _Section_ __ _ 4.08_ constitutes an independent
covenant that shall not be affected by performance or nonperformance of any
other provision of this Agreement. In the event that any of the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 4.08_ should ever be adjudicated and found by a final
determination of a court or any other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction to exceed the time, scope, geographic, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be
deemed reformed in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, scope, geographic
or other limitations enforceable under applicable Law in a means that comes
closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable provision,
in order to render the restrictive covenants set forth in this  _Section_ __
_ 4.08_ enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Each
party further acknowledges that a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 4.08_
would cause immeasurable injury to the other party and that, in the event of
a breach by such party or its controlled Affiliates of this _Section_ __ _
4.08_, the other party will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly,
in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to
seek such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available to restrain the
breaching party and its controlled Affiliates from the violation of the
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction and injunctive
relief without the necessity of posting a bond or proving special damages.
Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as prohibiting any party from
pursuing any other remedies available at law or equity for such breach,
including the recovery of damages.

3.02(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Affiliate Leases_ "),
which shall remain in full force and effect following the Effective Time,
Purchaser Parent and Purchaser Bank acknowledge and agree that Seller Bank,
its Subsidiaries and Seller Parent (and any of its applicable Affiliates)

Parent or an Affiliate of Seller Parent (other than Seller Bank), on
the other hand, are parties, and which are set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.02(aa)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, whether relating to products,
services or support provided to or by Seller Bank or otherwise, shall be
terminated or amended to remove Seller Bank immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and Seller Bank shall not be entitled to receive or obligated
to provide any products, services or support covered by such Contracts,
agreements, commitments or arrangements following the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that prior to the Closing, Seller Parent and Seller Bank shall
take all action necessary such that the operations of Seller Parent or its
Affiliates (other than Seller Bank) at the location of any Affiliate Lease
are segregated (physically and otherwise) from the operations of Seller Bank
at such location by the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, such terminations and amendments shall be
pursuant to the applicable terms, if any, of such Contracts as they are in
effect as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that such terminations
and amendments (including any terminations or amendments related to amounts
payable by Seller Bank pursuant to the Deferred Purchase Price Agreement,
dated May 2, 2018, related to the acquisition of Synergy One, and any other
Liabilities of Seller Bank to the Excluded Subsidiaries) shall be completed

Seller Bank or its Subsidiaries, other than expenses and costs that have been
fully accrued on the Seller Financial Statements prior to the date hereof.

Closing, Seller Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all such actions
necessary so that Intercompany Receivables or Intercompany Payables shall have
been settled or paid prior to the Closing; _provided_ that, the parties hereby
agree to work in good faith to agree upon mutually acceptable procedures for
the settlement or payment of trailing activities. Following the Closing, each
of Purchaser Parent and Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, retain all books, records and documents pertaining to all Liabilities,
Contracts and arrangements discharged, terminated or settled, as the case may
be, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.09_ in compliance with all applicable
Law and its document retention policies, and to make the same available after
the Closing for inspection and copying by the other party hereto, as
applicable, or its Representatives, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice, for any legitimate business purpose (including
for financial reporting, compliance or Tax purposes).

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall cause Seller Bank to
transfer the employment of any Bank Employee who, as of the date immediately

long-term disability benefits pursuant to any of Seller Parent, Seller or
Seller Banks long-term disability insurance policies to an entity other
than Seller Bank.

(b) For a period of one year after the Effective Time (the " _Continuation

provide to each Bank Employee who continues employment with Purchaser Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ "), with (1) base salary or wages, as applicable, and target annual
incentive opportunities that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to each such employee as of immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (2) retirement and welfare benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees
of Purchaser Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) During the Continuation Period, Purchaser Parent shall (1) comply with the
terms of the Employee Retention Plans in effect on the Effective Time, and
(2) except with respect to employees subject to Employee Retention Plans in
effect on the Effective Time, provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to provide,
each Continuing Employee who is (A) terminated without cause by Purchaser
Parent or its Subsidiaries or (B) resigns for Good Reason, with severance or
termination compensation and benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance or termination compensation and benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Purchaser Parent or the applicable Subsidiary (taking
into account service with Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time and service with Purchaser Parent and its Affiliates after the
Effective Time);  _provided_ that such payments may be conditioned on
execution of a release of claims in a form satisfactory to Purchaser Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if as a result of
any Continuing Employee ceasing to be employed by Purchaser Parent prior to
the first anniversary of the Closing Date or otherwise, the amounts accrued on
the Determination Date Balance Sheet for amounts payable pursuant to the
Employee Retention Plans on the first anniversary of the Closing Date exceeds
the amount actually paid by Purchaser Bank pursuant to the Employee Retention
Plans in respect of payments due on the first anniversary of Closing (such
excess, the " _Excess Retention Amount_ "), Purchaser Bank shall reimburse
Seller Parent in an amount equal to the Excess Retention Amount no later than
the fourteen (14) month anniversary of the Closing Date. On or prior to the

provide Seller Parent a schedule containing the names of all Continuing
Employees, the payments made by Purchaser Bank to such Continuing Employees
following the Closing Date pursuant to the Employee Retention Plans and the
Excess Retention Amount, if any.

consistent in all material respects with Seller Parents and its Affiliates
use and display of such Seller Marks as of the Closing Date, and (3) in
connection with the business of Seller Bank as conducted immediately prior
to Closing. During the TM Transition Period, Purchaser Parent, Purchaser Bank
and their respective Affiliates shall not create any new materials bearing
Seller Marks and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to expedite
its exhaustion, depletion or destruction of existing inventories bearing the
Seller Marks, and otherwise transition away from their respective further use
and display of Seller Marks, it being understood that such process shall be

Documents of each of Seller Bank in each case upon receipt of an undertaking,

contained in this  _Article_ __ _ VI_, shall survive until fully satisfied
in accordance with their terms.

6.02 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _By Seller Parent_. Except with respect to Taxes, which are covered by
_Section_ __ _ 4.14_, from and after the Effective Time, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article_ __ _ VI_, Seller Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser Parent, its Affiliates, and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
(each, a " _Purchaser Indemnitee_ ") against, and hold them harmless from and
against, any loss, liability, claim, damage, award, judgment, penalty, cost or
expense (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) (collectively, "
_Losses_ "), as incurred, to the extent, directly or indirectly, resulting
from, related to or arising out of:

 

(1) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Seller
Parent in this Agreement, other than any breach of  _Section_ __ _ 3.02(o)_,
which shall be governed by _Section_ __ _ 4.14_;

(2) any failure by Seller Parent, Seller or Seller Bank to perform any of
their respective covenants, obligations or agreements contained in this
Agreement; and

 

(3) any Liability relating to Synergy One, OMAFIN and SB Capital (the "
_Excluded Subsidiary Matters_ ").

 

(b) _By Purchaser Parent_. Except with respect to Taxes, which are covered by
_Section_ __ _ 4.14_, from and after the Effective Time, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article_ __ _ VI_, Purchaser Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller Parent, its Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (each,
a " _Seller Indemnitee_ ") against, and hold them harmless from and against,
any Losses, as incurred, to the extent, directly or indirectly, resulting
from, related to or arising out of:

 



\- 72 -

    

(1) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by
Purchaser Parent in this Agreement;

(2) any failure by Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Bank to perform any of their
respective covenants, obligations or agreements contained in this Agreement;
and

(3) any Liability of Seller Bank related to its businesses or assets or any
liability or obligation to the extent resulting from Purchaser Parents or
Seller Banks failure to pay, discharge and perform any such liability or
obligation when and as due, whether such liability or obligation is now in
existence or hereafter incurred (except for such matters for which Seller
Parent may be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_).

 

(c) _Limitations._ For purposes of calculating Losses subject to
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 4.14_ and this  _Article_ __ _ VI_,
any "materiality," or "Seller Material Adverse Effect" or "Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect" qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements shall be disregarded. Seller Parent shall not be liable to the
Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)(1)_ until the Losses
with respect to the matters contemplated by such Section exceed an aggregate
amount equal to $5,000,000 dollars (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case,
Seller Parent shall be liable for all Losses with respect to such matters in
excess of the Deductible, up to an aggregate maximum amount payable equal to
$100,000,000 dollars (the " _Indemnity Cap_ "); _provided_ , that, to the
extent that any Loss with respect to such matters arises out of, results from
or relates to a breach of any Fundamental Representation made by Seller Parent
or fraud, neither the Deductible nor the Indemnity Cap shall apply. Purchaser
Parent shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 6.02(b)(1)_ until the Losses with respect to such matters exceed the

with respect to such matters in excess of the Deductible, up to an aggregate
maximum amount payable equal to the Indemnity Cap; _provided_ , that, to the
extent that any Loss arises out of, results from or relates to a breach of
any Fundamental Representation made by Purchaser Parent or fraud, neither the
Deductible nor the Indemnity Cap shall apply. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Deductible and Indemnity Cap shall not apply to any Losses with respect to
Taxes, which are covered by _Section_ __ _ 4.14_. In addition to the other
limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_, in no event shall
Seller Parents maximum aggregate Liability for all Losses pursuant to
_Sections 4.14_ and _6.02(a)_ exceed the Purchase Price.

6.03 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

 

(a) Except with respect to Taxes, which are covered by _Section_ __ _ 4.14_,
each Person entitled to indemnification under this _Article_ __ _ VI_ (the "
_Indemnified Person_ ") shall give notice to the Person required to provide
indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") promptly after such
Indemnified Person receives written notice of any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or demand asserted by any Person who is not a party (or a successor
to a party) to this Agreement (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), which notice shall
(1) set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances pertaining
thereto and the basis for the Indemnified Persons right to indemnification,
(2) state that the Indemnified Person has incurred or paid or, in good faith,
believes it will have to incur or pay, Losses in an aggregate stated amount
(where practicable) arising from such Third-Party Claim, and (3) include
copies of all material pleadings, correspondence and other written evidence of
such Third-Party Claim; _provided_  that the failure by an Indemnified Person
to timely notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve any Indemnifying
Person of its obligations under this _Article_ __ _ VI_ except to the extent
that such failure prejudices such Indemnifying Person. Thereafter, in the
event that the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_, the Indemnified Person shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Person copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Person relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

 



\- 73 -

    

(b) Except with respect to Taxes, which are covered by  _Section_ __ _
4.14_, the Indemnifying Person will have the right to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice, at
the Indemnifying Persons sole cost and expense (which assumption must be
made by the Indemnifying Person, by notice to the Indemnified Person hereto in
writing, within thirty (30) days after having been notified by the Indemnified
Person of the existence of such Third-Party Claims);  _provided_ , _however_
, the Indemnifying Person shall assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim
resulting from, related to or arising out of any Excluded Subsidiary Matters;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Person shall not have the
right to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim if the claim seeks
equitable or material non-monetary remedies or obligations on the Indemnified
Person and; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that by assuming the defense of a
Third-Party Claim the Indemnifying Person acknowledges its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Person with respect to all or a significant portion
of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Person will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the judgment or
proposed settlement (1) involves only the payment of money damages against
which the Indemnified Person is indemnified by the Indemnifying Person, covers
the full amount of the Loss in such Third-Party Claim and releases
the Indemnified Person and its Affiliates from all Liability or obligation in
connection with such Third-Party Claim, (2) does not impose an injunction or
other non-monetary relief upon the Indemnified Person and (3) does not
involve a finding or admission of any violation of Law or other wrongdoing by
the Indemnified Person; _provided_ , _further_ , that a settlement or
compromise of a Third-Party Claim by the Indemnifying Person without
an admission of violation of Law or other wrongdoing shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person from any claim that the Indemnified Persons are entitled
to indemnification in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in
connection with such Third-Party Claim. Counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Person to defend any such Third-Party Claim shall be a recognized law firm
with the experience and resources to defend the Indemnified Person against any
such Third-Party Claim in any such proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person
elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (A) the Indemnified
Person will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Person
and its attorneys in such defense and (B) the Indemnifying Person will not be
liable to the Indemnified Person for legal expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof unless the
Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person are both named parties to the
proceedings and the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded, based
on the advice of counsel, that representation of both parties by the same
counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
material interests between them. In any such action or proceeding, the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at its own expense. Provided that
an Indemnified Person has given the Indemnifying Person notice of a Third-
Party Claim as required hereunder, unless an Indemnifying Person assumes the
defense of the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person may defend against
the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem appropriate, and
the Indemnifying Person shall be bound by any final determination with respect
to such Third-Party Claim prior to such assumption; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnified Person may not agree to any settlement without the
consent of the Indemnifying Person, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; it being understood that, to the extent an
Indemnifying Person has withheld its consent for the Indemnified Person to
agree to such settlement, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder for Losses in excess of the proposed settlement
amount. Each party shall reasonably cooperate with the other parties by
providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any Third-
Party Claim on a timely basis, and shall in good faith make its personnel
reasonably available to regularly consult with counsel for the other parties
and include such counsel in relevant conferences and proceedings to the
extent requested by such counsel. Within ten (10) Business Days of
determination of the amount of a Third-Party Claim becoming non-appealable
(whether as a result of procedural exhaustion or lapse of time), the
Indemnifying Person shall pay to the Indemnified Person an amount equal to the
aggregate Losses relating to such Third-Party Claim by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account or accounts designated in
writing by the indemnified party not less than one (1) Business Day prior to
such payment.

 



\- 74 -

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Article_ __
_ VI_, the parties shall cooperate with each other and use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the benefits of any insurance coverage for Third-
Party Claims that may be in effect at the time a Third-Party Claim is
asserted, and, if any insurance carrier for Seller Parent, any Affiliate of
Seller Parent, or Purchaser Parent is obligated or agrees to defend any Third-
Party Claim, such defense shall be tendered to such insurance carrier and the
rights of the parties among themselves regarding the assumption and control
of such defense shall be subject to the reasonable requirements of such
insurance carrier. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.17_, nothing
contained herein shall obligate any party to obtain or continue after the
Closing any insurance coverage for any period.

(d) The amount of any Losses of any Indemnified Person under this _Article_
__ _ VI_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.14_ shall be reduced by the amount, if any,
(1) which the Indemnified Person has actually received from any third Person
(including, without limitation, any insurance company or other insurance
provider or any other right of indemnification or reimbursement from any other
Person) (such amount being referred to herein as a " _Third-Party
Reimbursement_ "), in respect of the Losses suffered thereby and (2) of all
net Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Person through a
reduction in Taxes otherwise due as a result of such Losses incurred or
suffered by the Indemnified Person. If, after receipt by an Indemnified
Person of an indemnification payment hereunder, such Person receives a Third-
Party Reimbursement in respect of the same Losses (whether in whole or in
part) for which indemnification was made and such Third-Party Reimbursement
was not taken into account in assessing the amount of indemnification, then
the Indemnified Person shall promptly turn over all or the relevant portion of
such Third-Party Reimbursement to the Indemnifying Person up to the amount of
the indemnification paid pursuant hereto.

(e) No Indemnifying Person shall have any Liability under this _Article_ __ _
VI_ or  _Section_ __ _ 4.14_ for indirect, speculative, special, incidental,
consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including lost profits
(collectively, " _Excluded Damages_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that this
sentence shall not apply to any Losses incurred by an Indemnified Person in a
Third-Party Claim that includes claims against the Indemnified Person for
Excluded Damages. Any Indemnified Person that becomes aware of a Loss for
which it seeks indemnification under this _Article_ __ _ VI_ shall be
required to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Loss,
including taking any actions reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Person,
and an Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any Loss to the extent
that it is attributable to the Indemnified Persons failure to mitigate.
Seller Parent and its Affiliates shall have no Liability for any Loss (1) to
the extent reflected by a specific reserve identified on the face of the
Determination Date Balance Sheet or the Seller Financial Statements, except to
the extent any such reserve was not calculated in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, or (2) that is reflected as a direct adjustment to the
Purchase Price, as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.05(e)_.

6.04 _Direct Claims_.

 

If an Indemnified Person has a claim against an Indemnifying Person under this
Agreement that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted against or
sought to be collected from such Indemnifying Person (a " _Direct Claim_ "),
the Indemnified Person shall deliver notice of such Direct Claim with
reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Person, which notice shall (a) set
forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances pertaining thereto and
the basis for the Indemnified Persons right to indemnification, (b) state
that the Indemnified Person has incurred or paid or, in good faith, believes
it will have to incur or pay, Losses in an aggregate stated amount (where
practicable) arising from such Direct Claim, and (c) include copies of all
material written evidence of such Direct Claim. The failure by an

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing as follows:

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Purchaser Parent and Seller Parent;

 



\- 76 -

    

(b) by either Purchaser Parent or Seller Parent, by giving written notice of
such termination to the other party, if any condition to such partys
obligations hereunder has not been satisfied or waived and the Closing shall
not have occurred on or prior to August 13, 2020 (the " _Termination Date_
");  _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)_ shall not be available to (i) Seller Parent, if a
material breach by Seller Parent, Seller or Seller Bank of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of such party
under this Agreement has been the cause of the failure of the Closing to occur
on or before such date or (ii) Purchaser Parent, if a material breach by
Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Bank of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation of such party under this Agreement has been the cause
of the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;

 

(c) by Purchaser Parent or Seller Parent if any court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority shall have issued a
judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree, or taken any other action
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any of the Transactions and
such judgment, order, injunction, rule, decree or other action shall have
become final and non-appealable;

(d) by Purchaser Parent or Seller Parent if any Governmental Authority that
must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions or imposed any Burdensome
Condition, by final, non-appealable action of such Governmental Authority,
unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval is due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(e) by Purchaser Parent, if Seller Parent has breached any representation or
warranty, or any such representation or warranty has become untrue or
incorrect, or Seller Parent, Seller or Seller Bank has breached or failed to
perform any covenant or agreement, contained in this Agreement, which breach
or failure to be true or correct or failure to perform would give rise to a
failure of the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ or _5.03(b)_
(in either case, as if the Closing Date were occurring on the date on which
the accuracy of the representation or warranty is being assessed) and is not
cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to the
Seller Parent of such breach or is not capable of being cured not later than
the Termination Date; or

 

(f) by Seller Parent, if Purchaser Parent has breached any representation or
warranty, or any such representation or warranty has become untrue or
incorrect, or Purchaser Parent or Purchaser Bank has breached or failed to
perform any covenant or agreement, contained in this Agreement, which breach
or failure to be true and correct or failure to perform would give rise to a
failure of the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a)_ or _5.02(b)_
(in either case, as if the Closing Date were occurring on the date on which
the accuracy of the representation or warranty is being assessed) and is not
cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to Purchaser
Parent of such breach or is not capable of being cured not later than the
Termination Date.

hereto shall have any liability to any other party hereto or their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, partners, agents or
employees in connection with this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , and
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (a) no such
termination shall relieve any party of any liability or damages to the other
party resulting from any fraud or willful material breach of this Agreement
occurring prior to termination and (b) the provisions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement and in  _Section_ __ _ 4.04_ _,_ this _Section_ __
_ 7.02_ and _Article_ __ _ VIII_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.
