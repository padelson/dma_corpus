1.2.8 data and other information that cannot be disclosed or assigned to Buyer

cause such confidentiality restrictions to be waived;

 



 

1.2.9 any and all files, records, contracts, confidentiality agreements and
documents relating to Sellers efforts to sell any portion of the Property (or
any other discussions or negotiations regarding the sale or other disposition
of any portion of the Property), including, without limitation, any research,

connection therewith, and any bids or other information received in connection
therewith and information and correspondence in connection therewith;

Purchase Price or to the extent related to any of Buyers Assumed Obligations,

attributable to periods prior to the Effective Time;

occurring or existing prior to the Effective Time with respect to the Property
or production from the Property (including, without limitation, any and all
royalties, contract rights, insurance claims, receivables, revenues,
recoupment rights, recovery rights, accounting adjustments, mispayments,
erroneous payments or other claims of any nature in favor of Seller and
relating and accruing to any time period prior to the Effective Time), in each
case, to the extent, and only to the extent, such claims, rights and causes of
action relate to the Sellers Retained Obligations and/or Claims for which
Seller must indemnify Buyer hereunder;

1.3 **_Ownership of Production from the Property._**

 



 

1.3.1 _Production Before the Effective Time_. Seller shall be entitled to the
proceeds from the sale of all oil, gas, casinghead gas, condensate, distillate
and other liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons of every kind or description (" **
_Hydrocarbons_** ") produced from or attributable to the Property before the
Effective Time. If, on the Effective Time, Hydrocarbons produced from or
attributable to the Property before the Effective Time are stored in any Lease
or Unit stock tanks (the " ** _Stock Tank Oil_** "), or in gathering lines or
production facilities upstream of the sale or custody transfer meters (or
other applicable point at which the transfer of title actually occurs) of the
purchaser or processor of Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the
Property (the " ** _Pipeline Inventory_** "), Buyer shall purchase from Seller
the Stock Tank Oil and the Pipeline Inventory at the actual weighted average
price received for Hydrocarbons sold from such stock tanks and pipeline sales
points during the full calendar month preceding the Effective Time. If no
Hydrocarbons were sold in the preceding month, the actual weighted average
price received in the most recent preceding month in which sales occurred
shall be used. Buyer will pay Seller for the Stock Tank Oil and Pipeline
Inventory as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, as provided in _Section
2.2_ and _Section 2.3_. The Stock Tank Oil and the Pipeline Inventory will be
determined as of the Effective Time. Absent manifest error, Seller and Buyer
will accept the Lease or Unit operators tank gauge readings, meter tickets or
other inventory records of the Stock Tank Oil and Pipeline Inventory.

 



 

1.3.2 _Production After the Effective Time_. After Closing, Buyer shall be
entitled to the proceeds from the sale of all Hydrocarbons produced from or
attributable to the Property on and after the Effective Time. Seller has sold
or will sell on Buyers behalf all Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable
to the Property between the Effective Time and the Closing Date, and Seller
will credit Buyer for the proceeds of these sales as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, as provided in _Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.3_. Subject to
any continuing sale obligations under the Related Contracts, Buyer may sell
Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Property on and after the
Closing Date as it deems appropriate.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2**

 



 

 **CONSIDERATION**

 



 

2.1 **_Purchase Price and Performance Deposit_**.

 



 

2.1.1 _Purchase Price_. Buyer will pay Seller Eight Hundred, Fifty-Five
Million Dollars ($855,000,000) for the Property (the " ** _Purchase Price_**
"). The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as set forth in this Agreement (the
Purchase Price as so adjusted, the " ** _Adjusted Purchase Price_** ").

 



      
 

 



 

2.1.2 _Performance Deposit_. Upon execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall
deliver to Citibank, N.A. (" ** _Escrow Agent_** ") to the account (the " **
_Escrow Account_** ") specified in the Escrow Agreement dated as of the date
hereof by and among the parties and the Escrow Agent (" ** _Escrow
Agreement_** "), a form of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit C_, as a
performance deposit Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) (such amount plus any
interest earned thereon, the " ** _Performance Deposit_** "). The Performance
Deposit shall be held by Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. The Performance Deposit is solely to ensure the
performance of Buyers obligations under this Agreement. If Closing occurs,
the Performance Deposit shall be (a) applied as part of the payment of the
Adjusted Purchase Price, and the amount of the Adjusted Purchase Price
otherwise payable by Buyer at the Closing shall be reduced by that amount, (b)
reclassified at Closing to become a portion of the Holdback Amount, and (c)
retained by the Escrow Agent as provided for in _Section 2.4_. If Closing
does not occur, the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release the
Performance Deposit to Seller or Buyer pursuant to the applicable provision of
_Section 11.15 _and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

2.2 **_Adjustments at Closing_**.

 



 

2.2.1 _Preliminary Settlement Statement_. At Closing, the Purchase Price will
be adjusted as set forth in _Section 2.1.2, Section 2.2.2_ and _Section
2.2.3_. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller will provide Buyer a preliminary settlement statement (the " **
_Preliminary Settlement Statement_** ") identifying all adjustments known by
Seller at the time of the preparation of the Preliminary Settlement Statement
to be made at Closing. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that some items in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement may be estimates or otherwise subject to
change in the Final Settlement Statement.

 



 

2.2.2 _Upward Adjustments_. The Purchase Price will be increased by the
following (" ** _Upward Adjustments_** "):

 



 

(a) Sellers share of all actual production, maintenance and operating costs
and expenses, overhead charges under applicable operating agreements and
capital expenditures paid or incurred by Seller in connection with the
ownership or operation of the Property in the ordinary course (including,
without limitation, royalties, minimum royalties, rentals, and prepaid
charges), to the extent they are attributable to the Property for periods on
and after the Effective Time; provided, however, that for the period of time
between the Effective Time and the Closing Date, with respect to those
portions of the Property for which no operating agreement is in place, the
upward adjustment shall include a charge for overhead in the amount of One
Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per Well per month; provided, however, further that,
such amounts shall not include any amounts with respect to which it has been
determined that Buyer is entitled to receive indemnification from Seller
pursuant to _Section 8.4_ or with respect to any expense of Seller related to
any Adverse Environmental Conditions or cure of any Title Defect or cure of
any breach of Sellers representations or warranties hereunder;

 



 

(b) the amount of all Asset Taxes prorated to Buyer in accordance with
_Section 9.2.1_ but paid or payable by Seller (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Asset Taxes that were withheld or deducted from the gross amount
paid or payable to Seller in connection with a transaction to which _Section
2.2.3(c)_ applies, and therefore were taken into

 



      
 

 



 

account in determining the "proceeds received" by Seller for purposes of
applying _Section 2.2.3(c)_ with respect to such transaction);

 



 

(c) (i) Sellers share of any proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced
from or attributable to the Property and other income from the Property
received by Buyer, to the extent they are attributable to the ownership or
operation of the Property before the Effective Time, and (ii) the value of any
merchantable Stock Tank Oil and Pipeline Inventory (as determined in
accordance with _Section 1.3.1_) less all applicable royalties and Taxes;

 



 

(d) to the extent that Sellers interest in any of the Wells is underproduced
with respect to any Hydrocarbons as of the Effective Time, the sum of: (i)
with respect to gaseous Hydrocarbons, an amount equal to the product of (A)
the underproduced volumes, _multiplied by_ (B) $2.64 per MMBtu; and (ii) with
respect to liquid Hydrocarbons, an amount equal to the product of (A) the
underproduced volumes _multiplied by_ (B) $46.54 per Bbl; and

 



 

(e) any other increases in the Purchase Price specified in this Agreement or
otherwise agreed in writing between Seller and Buyer prior to or at Closing.

 



 

2.2.3 _Downward Adjustments_. The Purchase Price will be decreased by the
following (" ** _Downward Adjustments_** "):

 



 

(a) Sellers share of all actual production, maintenance and operating costs

capital expenditures paid or incurred by Buyer in connection with the
ownership or operation of the Property in the ordinary course, to the extent
they are attributable to the Property for the period before the Effective
Time;

 



 

(b) the amount of all Asset Taxes prorated to Seller in accordance with
_Section 9.2.1_ but paid or payable by Buyer;

 



 

(c) Sellers share (Buyers share after Closing) of any proceeds from the sale
of Hydrocarbons (i) produced from or attributable to the Property and other
income attributable to the Property and actually received by Seller, to the
extent they are attributable to the ownership or operation of the Property on
or after the Effective Time and (ii) with respect to merchantable Stock Tank
Oil and Pipeline Inventory for which Seller received an adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.2.2(c)(ii)_;

 



 

(d) the Allocated Value of any Property that is excluded from the Closing
pursuant to _Section 5.5_;

 



 

(e) all reductions to the Purchase Price for Title Defects, Environmental
Defects, Casualty Losses and Government Takings pursuant to _Section 5.3_,
_Section 5.6_, and _Section 5.7_, as applicable;

 



 

(f) an amount equal to the Suspense Funds, as provided in _Section 11.2_;

 



      
 

 



 

(g) to the extent that Sellers interest in any of the Wells is overproduced
with respect to any Hydrocarbons as of the Effective Time, the sum of: (i)
with respect to gaseous Hydrocarbons, an amount equal to the product of (A)
the overproduced volumes _multiplied by_ (B) $2.64 per MMBtu; and (ii) with
respect to liquid Hydrocarbons, an amount equal to the product of (A) the
overproduced volumes _multiplied by_ (B) $46.54 per Bbl; and

 



 

(h) any other decreases in the Purchase Price specified in this Agreement or
otherwise agreed in writing between Seller and Buyer.

 



 

2.3 **_Adjustments After Closing_**.

 



 

2.3.1 _Final Settlement Statement_. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date (the " ** _Final Settlement Date_** "), Seller will prepare a final
settlement statement for the Property containing a final reconciliation of the
adjustments to the Purchase Price specified in _Section 2.2_ (the " ** _Final
Settlement Statement_** "). Seller shall provide or otherwise make available
to Buyer such data and information as Buyer reasonably may request supporting
the amounts reflected on the Final Settlement Statement to permit Buyer to
comment on the Final Settlement Statement. Buyer will have thirty (30) days
after receiving the Final Settlement Statement to provide Seller with written
exceptions to any items in the Final Settlement Statement that Buyer believes
in good faith to be objectionable. All items in the Final Settlement Statement
that Buyer does not make a timely written exception within such thirty (30)
day review period will be deemed to be conclusively accepted by Buyer.

 



 

2.3.2 _Payment of Post-Closing Adjustments_. Any adjustments to the Purchase
Price (including disputed items as if they were undisputed by Buyer) will be
offset against each other so that only one payment is required. The party
owing payment will pay the other party the net post-Closing adjustment to the
Purchase Price within ten (10) days after the expiration of Buyers thirty
(30) day review period for the Final Settlement Statement. The payment of any
disputed items will be subject to the further rights of the parties under
_Section 2.3.3_.

 



 

2.3.3 _Resolution of Disputed Items_. After the completion and delivery of the
Final Settlement Statement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
attempt to reach agreement on the amount due with respect to any disputed
items in the Final Settlement Statement. If the parties agree on the amount
due with respect to any disputed items, and a payment adjustment is required,
the party owing payment will pay the other party within ten (10) days after
the parties reach agreement. If the parties are unable to agree on the amount
due with respect to any disputed items within thirty (30) days after Seller
receives Buyers written exceptions to the Final Settlement Statement, then
the disputed items shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration to
be conducted in Fort Worth, Texas, by a nationally-recognized independent
accounting firm selected by: (i) mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller; or (ii)
absent such agreement, by the Dallas office of the American Arbitration
Association (the " ** _Accounting Consultant_** "). The Accounting Consultant
shall not have been engaged to provide substantial work by any party or its
Affiliates within the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration. The
Accounting Consultant, once appointed, shall have no ex parte communications
with any of the parties concerning the determination required hereunder. All
communications between any party or its Affiliates and the Accounting
Consultant shall be conducted in writing, with copies sent

 



      
 

 



 

simultaneously to the other party in the same manner, or at a meeting or
conference call to which the representatives of both parties have been invited
and of which such parties have been provided at least five (5) days notice.
Within ten (10) days of appointment of the Accounting Consultant, each of
Seller and Buyer shall present the Accounting Consultant with its position
with respect to the disputed items, and all other supporting information that
it desires, with a copy to the other party. The Accounting Consultant shall
also be provided with a copy of this Agreement. Within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such materials and after receipt of any additional information
required by the Accounting Consultant, the Accounting Consultant shall make
its determination, which shall be in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and shall be within the disputed range, and such determination shall
be final and binding upon the parties, without right of appeal, absent
manifest error. The Accounting Consultant may not award damages, interest or
penalties to either party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall
each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Seller
shall bear one-half (1/2) and Buyer shall bear one-half (1/2) of the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Consultant.

 



 

2.3.4 _Further Revenues and Expenses_. After the completion of the post-
Closing adjustments under this _Section 2.3_: (a) if either party receives
revenues that belong to the other party under this Agreement, the party
receiving the revenues agrees to promptly remit those revenues to the other
party; and (b) if either party pays expenses that are the responsibility of
the other party under this Agreement, then the party on whose behalf the
expenses were paid agrees to promptly reimburse the other party for the
expenses paid on its behalf upon receiving reasonably satisfactory evidence of
such payment. However, neither party will be obligated to reimburse the other
party for any such expense in excess of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) unless
it has been consulted about that expense prior to payment.

 



 

2.4 **_Post-Closing Escrow_**. At Closing, a portion of the Purchase Price
equal to Eighty-Five Million Dollars ($85,000,000) less the Performance
Deposit (the " ** _Closing Escrow Amount_** ") will be delivered by Buyer to
the Escrow Agent to serve along with the Performance Deposit as security in
support of the indemnification obligations of Seller pursuant to _Section
8.4_. For purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the " **
_Holdback Amount_** " shall equal the Closing Escrow Amount delivered by Buyer
to the Escrow Agent at Closing plus the Performance Deposit. The Holdback
Amount, together with the interest earned thereon from and after the Closing
Date, is referred to herein as the " ** _Escrow Fund_**." The Escrow Fund
shall be held in the Escrow Account and released in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.4_ and the Escrow Agreement. From time to time
after Closing, the Escrow Agent shall be jointly instructed in writing by
Seller and Buyer to release all or portions of then-remaining Escrow Fund to
Buyer or to Seller, in each case, as provided below in this _Section 2.4._

 



 

2.4.1 _Escrow Claims_. If at any time prior to the date that is twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date (such time period, the " ** _Holdback Period_**
") there are amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund, to the extent that Seller
does not promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days after receipt of a
Claim Notice from Buyer) reimburse or pay Buyer for any amounts to which Buyer
is entitled with respect to such Claim Notice pursuant to _Section 8.4_, then
Buyer shall be entitled to deliver to Seller written notice (an " ** _Escrow
Claim Notice_** "), which notice shall specify with particularity the nature
and amount of Buyers claim pursuant to _Section 8.4 _as set forth in the
Claim Notice (the " ** _Escrow Claim_** "), including specific details of and
a specific

 



      
 

 



 

basis under this Agreement entitling Buyer to such Escrow Claim. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller may require that Buyer first recover all amounts to
which Buyer is entitled hereunder from the Escrow Account to the extent of the
Escrow Fund then available if Seller delivers to Buyer and the Escrow Agent
executed irrevocable written instructions that instruct the Escrow Agent to
deliver to Buyer an amount from the Escrow Fund in respect of such Escrow
Claim equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of such Escrow Claim, or (b) the
amount of the Escrow Fund then remaining in the Escrow Account.

 



 

2.4.2 _Resolution of Escrow Claims_. Upon final resolution of any such Escrow
Claim pursuant to the mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller or as
determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 11.11_, if Buyer is entitled to all
or any portion of the Escrow Fund then-remaining, then Seller and Buyer shall
provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer
the amount set forth in such joint written instruction, which amount shall be
that portion of the Escrow Fund then-remaining in the Escrow Account at such
time as would satisfy such Escrow Claim as so finally resolved.

 



 

2.4.3 _Partial Release of Escrow Fund_. On the first Business Day following
the date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall
provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to Seller
fifty percent (50%) of the amount then-remaining in the Escrow Fund, excluding
those amounts attributable to any then-outstanding Escrow Claim for which
Buyer has in good faith provided an Escrow Claim Notice to Seller in
accordance with _Section 2.4.1_ that have not been previously satisfied, and,
with respect to each such outstanding Escrow Claim, each amount attributable
thereto (to the extent sufficient funds remain in the Escrow Fund as of such
date and if there are insufficient funds remaining in the Escrow Fund as of
such date, the entirety of the funds remaining in the Escrow Fund as of such
date) shall remain part of the Escrow Fund in the Escrow Account until final
resolution of such Escrow Claim pursuant to the mutual written agreement of
Buyer and Seller or as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 11.11_.

 



 

2.4.4 _Release of Remaining Escrow Fund_. On the first Business Day following
the expiration of the Holdback Period, Seller and Buyer shall provide joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to Seller any amounts
then-remaining in the Escrow Fund, excluding those amounts attributable to any
then-outstanding Escrow Claim for which Buyer has in good faith provided an
Escrow Claim Notice to Seller in accordance with _Section 2.4.1_ that have
not been previously satisfied, and, with respect to each such outstanding
Escrow Claim, each amount attributable thereto (to the extent sufficient funds
remain in the Escrow Fund as of such date and if there are insufficient funds
remaining in the Escrow Fund as of such date, the entirety of the funds
remaining in the Escrow Fund as of such date) shall remain part of the Escrow
Fund in the Escrow Account until final resolution of such Escrow Claim
pursuant to the mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller or as determined
by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with _Section 11.11_.

 



 

2.5 **_Payment Method_**. Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, all
payments under this Agreement will be by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account designated by the party receiving payment.

 



       
 

 



 

2.6 **_Principles of Accounting_**. The Preliminary Settlement Statement and
Final Settlement Statement will be prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the petroleum industry, consistently applied,
and applicable laws, rules and regulations.

 



 

2.7 **_Reporting Value of the Property_**. Neither party will take any
position in preparing financial statements, Tax Returns, reports to
shareholders or governmental authorities, or otherwise, that is inconsistent
with the allocation of value for the Property in _Exhibit B_, unless the
parties otherwise agree in writing. The value assigned to each portion of the
Property in _Exhibit B_ is hereafter referred to as the " ** _Allocated
Value_** " of that portion of the Property.

 



 

2.8 **_Section 1031 Exchange_**. Seller and Buyer hereby agree that Buyer
shall have the right at any time prior to Closing to assign all or a portion
of its rights under this Agreement to a " ** _Qualified Intermediary_** " (as
that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k) 1(g)(4)(v) of the Treasury
Regulations) in order to accomplish the transaction in a manner that will
comply, either in whole or in part, with the requirements of a like kind
exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " ** _Code_** "). Likewise, Seller shall have the right at any
time prior to Closing to assign all or a portion of its rights under this
Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary for the same purpose. In the event a
party assigns its rights under this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 2.8_,
such party agrees to notify the other parties in writing of such assignment at
or before Closing. If Seller assigns its rights under this Agreement for this
purpose, Buyer agrees to: (a) consent to Sellers assignment of its rights in
this Agreement; and (b) pay the Purchase Price into a qualified escrow or
qualified trust account at Closing as directed in writing. If Buyer assigns
its rights under this Agreement for this purpose, Seller agrees to: (i)
consent to Buyers assignment of its rights in this Agreement; (ii) accept the
Purchase Price from the qualified escrow or qualified trust account at
Closing; and (iii) at Closing, convey and assign directly to Buyer the
Property upon satisfaction of the other conditions to Closing and other terms
and conditions hereof. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that any
assignment of this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary shall not delay the
Closing, shall not release any party hereto from any of its respective
liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations) to the other
parties hereto under this Agreement, and that no party represents to any other
party that any particular Tax treatment will be given to a party as a result
thereof. Seller and Buyer further agree that the party not electing to effect
a like-kind exchange will not incur any additional costs, expenses, fees or
liabilities as a result of or connected with the like-kind exchange.

 



 

2.9 **_Allocation of Consideration for Tax Purposes_**. The Purchase Price
(plus the Buyers Assumed Obligations, to the extent properly taken into
account under the Code), shall be allocated among the Property in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as
appropriate) (the " ** _Allocation_** "). The Allocation shall be consistent
with _Exhibit B_, and shall be delivered by Buyer to Seller within ten (10)
days after the Final Settlement Date for Sellers approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller and Buyer
shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to the Allocation.
If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any such dispute, such dispute shall
be resolved promptly in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.3.3_. If
the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 8.11_, the Allocation shall be adjusted as mutually agreed by Buyer
and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including, but not
limited to, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent with the
Allocation. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any Tax position inconsistent
with such Allocation and neither Buyer nor Seller shall agree to any proposed
adjustment to the Allocation by any Taxing authority without first giving the
other party prior written notice; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Taxing authority based upon or arising out of the
Allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before
any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing authority
challenging such Allocation.

5.3_. The Phase I Environmental Assessment may be conducted by Buyers agent
or representative, such agent or representative to be Environmental Resources
Management Southwest, Inc. or such other agent or representative as is
mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer (the " ** _Inspector_** "). For

matter or condition with respect to any portion of the Property in its Phase I
Environmental Assessment that in the Inspectors reasonable written opinion
warrants an ASTM Phase II Environmental Site Assessment, which includes soil
sampling (a " ** _Phase II Environmental Assessment_** "), Buyer may request
to conduct such Phase II Environmental Assessment with respect to the portion
of the Property specifically identified in the Phase I Environmental
Assessment that warrants a Phase II Environmental Assessment. In the event any
Seller or third-Person operator with respect to the Property refuses to allow
Buyer to conduct a Phase II Environmental Assessment, Buyer, at its sole
election, shall have the right to exclude the affected portion of the Property
from the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such portion of the Property. Any such
permission of Seller to conduct a Phase II Environmental Assessment shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

provide a copy of the Inspectors final Phase I Environmental Assessment (and
Phase II Environmental Assessment, if applicable) to Seller, including all
appendices or exhibits thereto. In addition to Buyers confidentiality
obligations in _Section 11.3_, Buyer agrees not to disclose the Inspectors
Phase I Environmental Assessment (or Phase II Environmental Assessment, if
applicable) or any written reports, data and conclusions of the Inspector
(including any drafts) (the " ** _Inspection Results_** ") or any Seller
information reviewed during the Phase I Environmental Assessment to third
parties without the prior written agreement of Seller, except as required by
law or by the order of a court or regulatory agency, provided that Buyer shall
notify Seller in writing not less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to making
any such required disclosure, to the extent permitted by law. This
confidentiality obligation shall be effective until the Closing Date. If
Closing does not occur, the confidentiality obligations in _Section 11.3_
shall continue and the Inspection Results shall be deemed the property of the
Seller and Buyer shall provide any remaining copies of the Inspection Results
to Seller or promptly destroy such copies.

 



 

5.3.3 _Notice of Adverse Environmental Conditions_. Prior to Closing, Buyer
may review the Inspection Results for the Property and determine, based on the
Inspection Results or any other information as may be available to Buyer, if

any Adverse Environmental Condition it discovers with respect to the Property

reasonably detailed description of the alleged Adverse Environmental
Condition; (b) the Property affected; (c) the Allocated Value of the Property
subject to the alleged Adverse Environmental Condition; (d) data and
information in Buyers and/or the Inspectors possession reasonably necessary
for Seller to substantiate and verify the existence of the alleged Adverse
Environmental Condition, including, without limitation, a copy of the
Inspection Results, limited to that portion of the Property subject to the
Adverse Environmental Condition; and (e) the estimated Environmental Defect
Value attributable thereto. The " ** _Environmental Defect Value_** "
attributable to any Adverse Environmental Condition shall be the estimated
cost of any remediation or other corrective action reasonably designed to meet
the least restrictive standard or remedy that fully complies with applicable
Environmental Laws (including where applicable, engineering or institutional
controls or any less stringent standards or remedies resulting from site-
specific risk assessments)

 



      
 

 



 

based on the current nature of use of the relevant facility or property, on a
current cost basis, net to Sellers interest in the relevant Property (the "
** _Standard_** "). The term " ** _Adverse Environmental Condition_** " means
and includes, with respect to any portion of the Property: (a) the failure of
the Property (or Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Property
or operation of the Property) to be in compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws; (b) the Property (or Seller or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the Property or operation of the Property) being subject to any
uncured notices of violations of or noncompliance with any applicable
Environmental Laws; or (c) any hazardous materials or other environmental
pollution have been released and are present at any portion of the Property in
violation of Environmental Laws or for which any remediation or corrective
action is required (or if known, would be required) under any Environmental
Law. The term " ** _Environmental Laws_** " means any statute, law, common
law, ordinance, rule, regulation, code, order, injunction or decree issued by
any federal, state or local governmental authority in effect on or before the
Execution Date relating to the prevention of pollution, the preservation and
restoration of environmental quality, the protection of human health, wildlife
or environmentally sensitive areas, the remediation of contamination, the
generation, handling, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal or release
into the environment of waste materials, or the regulation of or exposure to
hazardous or toxic substances, including, without limitation, the federal Oil
Pollution Act (OPA), the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the federal Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA), the federal Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA), the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 USC § 5101 et
seq.), the Texas Health and Safety Code, the Texas Water Code (TWC), the Texas
Natural Resources Code, and the federal, state and local rules, regulations,
ordinances, orders and governmental directives implementing such statutes.
Subject to and without limiting Sellers indemnity obligations under this
Agreement and Buyers remedies for the breach of the representation of Seller
set forth in _Section 3.2.13_, Buyer shall be deemed to have conclusively
waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any Adverse Environmental
Condition of which Seller has not been given timely notice in accordance with
the requirements of this _Section 5.3.3_.

 



 

5.3.4 _Remedies for Uncured, Unwaived Adverse Environmental Conditions_.

 



 

(a) For each Adverse Environmental Condition identified prior to the
Environmental Claim Date as provided in _Section 5.3.3_, Seller may elect, at
its sole option, with notice to Buyer at any time on or prior to three (3)
Business Days before Closing, and without prejudice to the parties continuing
right to dispute the existence or nature of or cost to remediate such Adverse
Environmental Condition to the Standard, to:

 



 

(i) with the written consent of Buyer, remediate the asserted Adverse
Environmental Condition to the Standard, with no adjustment to the Purchase
Price at Closing, which remediation effort may continue after Closing;
provided, however, that until the Adverse Environmental Condition is
remediated to the Standard, Seller shall INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS
Buyer from and against all Claims related to such Adverse Environmental
Condition, provided, further, however, that such indemnity shall terminate as
to each particular Adverse Environmental Condition when the Adverse
Environmental Condition is remediated to the Standard;

 



 

(ii) subject to the remaining provisions of this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

(A) if the Environmental Defect Value is less than the Allocated Value of the
affected Property, transfer the affected Property to Buyer at Closing and
reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Value as agreed upon by
Seller and Buyer or determined pursuant to _Section 5.3.5_ or (B) if the
Environmental Defect Value is greater than the Allocated Value of the affected
Property retain the affected Property and reduce the Purchase Price by the
Allocated Value thereof; or

 



 

(iii) retain the affected Property and reduce the Purchase Price by the
Allocated Value thereof.

 



 

Should Seller fail to timely exercise any of the three (3) options stated
above, or if there is a dispute as to an Adverse Environmental Condition
subject to resolution under _Section 5.3.5_, then _Section 5.3.4(a)(ii)_
shall apply.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.3_, Buyer
shall have no remedy hereunder for any Adverse Environmental Condition unless:
(i) the Environmental Defect Value for such Adverse Environmental Condition
exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) net to Sellers interest in
the allegedly affected portion of the Property (the " ** _Environmental
Threshold_** "), in which event the value of such defect will be taken into
account from first dollar; and (ii) the aggregate Environmental Defect Values
for the Adverse Environmental Conditions with Environmental Defect Values
exceeding the Environmental Threshold exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%)
of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such amount exceeds two and
one-half percent (2.5%) of the Purchase Price.

 



 

5.3.5 _Adverse Environmental Condition Disputes_.

 



 

(a) Without prejudice to either partys position as to the existence or nature
of an Adverse Environmental Condition or the cost to remediate an Adverse
Environmental Condition to the Standard, Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
agree prior to the Closing Date on: (i) the existence of any Adverse
Environmental Condition; (ii) Sellers remediation of any Adverse
Environmental Condition to the Standard; and (iii) the Environmental Defect
Value associated with any Adverse Environmental Conditions. If Seller and
Buyer are unable to agree on any of the above (collectively or individually,
as applicable, the " ** _Disputed Environmental Matters_** ") prior to the
Closing Date, an amount equal to the average of (A) the Environmental Defect
Value claimed in good faith by Seller and (B) the Environmental Defect Value
claimed in good faith by Buyer, shall be used to determine the Purchase Price
to be paid at Closing, and the Disputed Environmental Matters shall be
exclusively and finally resolved by expert determination pursuant to _Section
5.3.5(b)_.

 



 

(b) Within ten (10) days following the Closing Date, all Disputed
Environmental Matters shall be submitted to an environmental consultant with
at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas environmental matters as
selected by: (i) mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller; or (ii) absent such
agreement during such ten (10) day period, by the Dallas office of the
American Arbitration Association (the " ** _Environmental Consultant_** ").
The Environmental Consultant shall not have been employed by any party or its
Affiliates within the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration. The
Environmental Consultant, once appointed,

 



      
 

 



 

shall have no ex parte communications with any of the parties concerning the
determination required hereunder. All communications between any party or its
Affiliates and the Environmental Consultant shall be conducted in writing,
with copies sent simultaneously to the other party in the same manner, or at a
meeting or conference call to which the representatives of both Seller and
Buyer have been invited and of which such parties have been provided at least
five (5) days notice. Within ten (10) days of appointment of the
Environmental Consultant, each of Seller and Buyer shall present the
Environmental Consultant with a written statement of its position on the
Disputed Environmental Matters, including a written statement of its position
with respect to any disputes regarding: (x) the existence of any Adverse
Environmental Condition; (y) the proposed remediation of any Adverse
Environmental Condition to the Standard; and (z) the estimated Environmental
Defect Value, in each case, as applicable, together with all other supporting
information that it deems relevant, with a copy to the other party. The
Environmental Consultant shall also be provided with a copy of this Agreement.
Within forty-five (45) days after receipt of such materials and after receipt
of any additional information required by the Environmental Consultant, the
Environmental Consultant shall make its determination, which shall be final
and binding upon all parties, without right of appeal, absent manifest error.
In making its determination, the Environmental Consultant shall be bound by
the rules set forth in this _Section 5.3_. In no event shall the
Environmental Consultant select an amount lower than the amount proposed by
Seller nor higher than the amount proposed by Buyer, as applicable. The
Environmental Consultant shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining: (A) the existence of any Adverse Environmental Condition in
dispute; (B) whether any Adverse Environmental Condition has been remediated
to the Standard; and (C) the specific disputed Environmental Defect Values.
The Environmental Consultant may not award damages, interest or penalties to
any party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half
(1/2) and Buyer shall bear one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses of the
Environmental Consultant.

 



 

5.3.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to and without limiting Sellers indemnity
obligations under this Agreement and Buyers remedies for the breach of the
representation of Seller set forth in _Section 3.2.13_, the remedies set
forth in _Section 8.4.1_ with respect to _Section 3.2.13 _and this _Section
5.3_ are the sole and exclusive remedies of Buyer with respect to any Adverse
Environmental Condition (and all Environmental Obligations arising out of any
such Adverse Environmental Condition) attributable to the ownership or
operation of the Property by Seller or any of its parent, subsidiary or
affiliated entities of any tier prior to the Effective Time, or the condition
of the Property prior to the Effective Time, regardless of whether Buyer
notifies Seller of any such Adverse Environmental Condition. Subject to and
without limiting Sellers indemnity obligations under this Agreement and
Buyers remedies for the breach of the representation of Seller set forth in
_Section 3.2.13_, Seller shall have no liability to Buyer for any such
Adverse Environmental Condition (or its related Environmental Obligations) if
Buyer fails to notify Seller as provided in _Section 5.3.3_.

 



 

5.4 **_Bonding Requirements_**. Buyer agrees to promptly purchase and post any
and all bonds, supplemental bonds or other securities which may be required of
it pursuant to all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and
regulations.

 



      
 

 



 

5.5 **_Preferential Rights and Consents to Assign_**.

 



 

5.5.1 _Notices to Holders_.

 



 

(a) If Sellers right to convey any of the Property to Buyer is subject to
third-Person preferential purchase rights, rights of first refusal, or similar
rights (collectively, " ** _Preferential Rights_** "), or third-Person
consents to assign or similar rights, excluding consents ordinarily obtained
after Closing (collectively, " ** _Consents_** "), then, as soon as reasonably
practical after the Execution Date, but in any event, within ten (10) days
following the Execution Date, Seller shall: (i) notify the holders of the
Preferential Rights and Consents identified on _Schedule 3.2.3_ (or any
Preferential Rights or Consents subsequently identified that are not on
_Schedule 3.2.3_ ) or (pursuant to a notice in material compliance with the
contractual provisions of such Preferential Rights and Consents) that it
intends to transfer the Property to Buyer; (ii) provide the holders of such
Preferential Rights and Consents with any information about the transfer of
the Property to which they are entitled according to the contractual
provisions of such Preferential Rights and Consents; (iii) in the case of such
Preferential Rights, request the holders of such Preferential Rights to waive
their right to purchase the affected Property and (iv) in the case of such
Consents, request the holders of such Consents to consent to the assignment of
the affected Property to Buyer.

 



 

(b) Before Closing, Seller shall notify Buyer whether: (i) any Preferential
Rights are exercised or waived; (ii) any Consents are granted or denied or
cannot be obtained before Closing; or (iii) the requisite time periods have
elapsed and any Preferential Rights are deemed waived or Consents deemed given
by the lapse of such requisite time periods under the applicable agreements.

 



 

(c) If any Preferential Rights are exercised, the portion of the Property
burdened by the exercised Preferential Right shall be excluded, and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the excluded portion
of the Property. Seller will not be liable to Buyer if any Preferential Rights
are exercised, or any Consents are denied, except for the Purchase Price
adjustment herein provided. Buyer shall be obliged to close on all other
portions of the Property, subject to _Section 5.5.2_ and Buyers termination
right in _Section 5.8_.

 



 

5.5.2 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) _Preferential Rights_. Before Closing, if any Preferential Right has not
been waived or exercised in accordance with its terms, and the time period for
such exercise has not expired, the parties shall proceed to Closing as to the
portion of the Property burdened by such Preferential Rights without
adjustment to the Purchase Price, subject to the further obligations of Buyer
and Seller set forth in this _Section 5.5.2(a)_ in the event such
Preferential Rights are ultimately exercised after Closing. After Closing, if:
(i) any holder of Preferential Rights has alleged or alleges improper notice
of sale; (ii) Seller or Buyer discover, or any third Person alleges, the
existence of additional Preferential Rights; or (iii) the time period for
exercise of any Preferential Right did not expire before Closing, then, in
each case, Seller and Buyer will attempt to obtain waivers of such
Preferential Rights. If Seller and Buyer are unable to obtain waivers of such
Preferential Rights, and such Preferential Rights are not deemed waived, or
the third Person ultimately establishes and exercises its rights, then Buyer
shall re-convey the

 



      
 

 



 

affected Property (pursuant to an assignment containing a special warranty of
title only) to Seller in order that Seller may satisfy all such Preferential
Rights obligations and Seller shall simultaneously with such reconveyance
refund to Buyer the Allocated Value of such Property.

 



 

(b) _Consents_.

 



 

(i) Before Closing, Seller shall use reasonable efforts (which shall not
require the payment of money to third Persons) to obtain all Consents. If
Seller is unable to obtain a Consent (other than a Hard Consent), then Seller
and Buyer shall proceed to Closing as to the portion of the Property affected
by the un-obtained Consent without adjustment to the Purchase Price, subject
to the further obligations of Seller and Buyer set forth in this _Section
5.5.2(b)_. After Closing, Seller shall attempt to obtain any un-obtained
Consents (which shall not require the payment of money to third Persons),
including Consents alleged by third Persons or identified after Closing, and
Buyer shall provide reasonable assistance to Seller. If Seller is unable to
obtain such Consents on or before the Final Settlement Date, then Buyer shall
retain ownership of the affected portion of the Property.

 



 

(ii) If Seller fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and the failure to
obtain such consent would cause (or give the lessor or grantor the right to
cause) (A) the assignment of the portion of the Property affected thereby to
Buyer to be void or (B) the termination of the Lease affected thereby under
the express terms thereof (each, a " ** _Hard Consent_** "), then, in each
such case, the affected portion of the Property shall be excluded from the
Property to be acquired by Buyer at Closing hereunder and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the portion of the Property so
excluded. In the event that a Hard Consent (with respect to any applicable
portion of the Property excluded pursuant to this _Section 5.5.2(b)(ii)_ that
was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained prior to the Final Settlement
Date, then, Buyer shall purchase, within ten (10) days after such Hard Consent
is obtained, such portion of the Property so excluded as a result of such
previously un-obtained Hard Consent under the terms of this Agreement for the
amount (if any) by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing due to the
exclusion of such portion of the Property (as such amount is appropriately
adjusted in accordance with _Section 2.2 _with respect to such portion of the
Property), and Seller shall assign to Buyer such portion of the Property
pursuant to an assignment, in a form substantially similar to the Assignment.

 



 

(c) _Limitation of Liability_. Except to the extent Seller fails to fulfill
its obligations set forth above in this _Section 5.5_ and subject to Buyers
remedies for Sellers breach of the representations and warranties in _Section
3.2.3_, Buyer shall DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS Seller from and
against all Claims, actions, causes of action whatsoever that arise out of the
failure to obtain waivers of Preferential Rights or the failure to obtain
Consents with respect to any transfer by Seller to Buyer of any portion of the
Property and with respect to subsequent transfers **WHETHER OR NOT SUCH
CLAIMS, ACTIONS OR CAUSES OF ACTION ARISE OUT OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF SELLER
(INCLUDING SELLER S SOLE, SIMPLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE,
BUT EXPRESSLY EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SELLER).**

 



      
 

 



 

5.6 **_Title Defects_**.

 



 

5.6.1 _Certain Definitions_.

 



 

(a) _Title Defects_. For the purposes of this Agreement, a " ** _Title
Defect_** " means any (1) lien, mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, charge,
collateral assignment, security interest or other encumbrance or surface
restriction of any kind affecting Sellers title or interest in the Property;
or (2) impairment, encroachment, irregularity, defect in or dispute concerning
Sellers title to the Property that would:

 



 

(i) reduce Sellers Net Revenue Interest in the currently producing formations
of any Well below that set forth in _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 2_ for such Well;

 



 

(ii) increase Sellers Working Interest in the currently producing formations
of any Well above that set forth in _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 2_ for such Well,
without a corresponding and proportionate increase in Sellers Net Revenue
Interest;

 



 

(iii) reduce the number of net mineral acres attributable to Sellers interest
in a Lease, insofar as such Lease affects the Target Depth, below that set
forth in _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 1_ for such Lease; or

 



 

(iv) reduce Sellers Net Revenue Interest in a Lease, insofar as such Lease
affects the Target Depth, below that set forth in _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 1_
for such Lease.

 



 

For purposes of this _Section 5.6_, the " ** _Target Depth_** " shall refer
to the stratigraphic equivalent of the interval shown from 9,515 feet to
12,447 feet on the log of the Petrohawk Operating CompanyOxy Fee "24" Lease,
Well No. 1 (API No. 42-389-32637), located in Section 24, Block C18, PSL
Survey, A-2150, Reeves County, Texas, unless otherwise limited on _Exhibit
A_, _Schedule 1_. For purposes of this _Section 5.6_, a " ** _net mineral
acre_** " shall mean as to each parcel or tract of land burdened by a Lease,
the product of (a) the number of acres of land that are in such parcel or
tract (i.e., gross acres), multiplied by (b) the lessors undivided interest
in the lands covered by such Lease, multiplied by (c) the Sellers undivided
interest in such Lease (provided, however, if items (b) and (c) of the
definition vary as to different areas within any tracts or parcels burdened by
such Lease, a separate calculation shall be performed with respect to each
such area). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be
considered Title Defects: (1) any matter based solely on lack of information
or documents in Sellers files; (2) any failure to record federal Leases or
assignments thereof in county records; (3) any Adverse Environmental
Condition, Production Imbalances set forth on _Schedule 3.2.5_ , Permitted
Encumbrance, Consents set forth on _Schedule 3.2.3_ or Preferential Rights set
forth on _Schedule 3.2.3_ ; (4) defects arising out of lack of survey (unless
required by applicable law); (5) defects that have been cured by applicable
laws of limitations or prescription; (6) defects in the chain of title
consisting of the mere failure to recite marital status in a document or
omissions of successions of heirship or estate proceedings, unless Buyer
provides affirmative evidence that such failure or omission has resulted in
another Persons superior claim of title; and (7) the expiration of the
primary term of any Lease in effect on the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Permitted Encumbrances_. The term " ** _Permitted Encumbrance_** " means:

 



 

(i) any materialmans, mechanics, repairmans, employees, contractors,
operators or other similar liens, security interests or charges for
liquidated amounts arising in the ordinary course of business incidental to
construction, maintenance, development, production or operation of the
Property, or the production or processing of Hydrocarbons therefrom, that are
not yet delinquent;

 



 

(ii) any liens for Taxes not yet delinquent;

 



 

(iii) any liens or security interests created by law or reserved in oil, gas
and/or mineral leases for royalty, bonus or rental or for compliance with the
terms of leases;

 



 

(iv) any easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, licenses, surface
leases and other rights with respect to surface operations, to the extent such
matters do not interfere in any material respect with Sellers ownership or
operation of any portion of the Property;

 



 

(v) all royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, carried
interests, reversionary interests and other burdens, to the extent that the
net cumulative effect of such burdens, as to a particular Property, does not
operate to reduce Sellers Net Revenue Interest in such Property below that
set forth in the applicable Schedule to _Exhibit A_;

 



 

(vi) to the extent not currently triggered, conventional rights of
reassignment arising upon surrender or abandonment of any Property;

 



 

(vii) rights reserved to or vested in any governmental authority to control or
regulate any of the Wells and all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
orders of such authorities, in each case, so long as the same have not been
applied to decrease Sellers Net Revenue Interest in any Well below that set
forth in _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 2_ for such Well or increase Sellers Working
Interest in any Well above that set forth in _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 2_ for
such Well (without a corresponding and proportionate increase in the Net
Revenue Interest for such Well);

 



 

(viii) any defects or irregularities in acknowledgements, unless Buyer
provides affirmative evidence that such failure or omission has resulted in
another Persons superior claim of title;

 



 

(ix) any defects and irregularities arising out of the lack of recorded powers
of attorney from corporations or partnerships to execute and deliver documents
on their behalf, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such failure
or omission has resulted in another Persons superior claim of title;

 



 

(x) any defects or irregularities resulting from prior oil and gas leases,
which, on their face, expired more than fifteen (15) years ago and for which
there were no

 



       
 

 



 

production under such leases which would have maintained such leases beyond
their primary term;

 



 

(xi) any defects or irregularities arising out of mortgages, deeds of trust,
and other encumbrances, which, by their terms, matured more than fifteen (15)
years ago without any (A) extension of said maturity date or (B) cause of
action on any underlying debt, but which have not been released of record;

 



 

(xii) defects or irregularities in title, which, for a period of fifteen (15)
years or more have not delayed or prevented Seller (or its predecessors) from
receiving its Net Revenue Interest from any Well or Lease and for which no
claim was or has been made by any third Person;

 



 

(xiii) any liens or security interests for which Seller obtains a release on
or prior to the Closing Date; or

 



 

(xiv) with respect to non-producing Leases only, defects arising from any
outstanding deed of trust or mortgage burdening the interest of a mineral
lessor, which has not been subordinated to the lessees interest.

 



 

(c) _Title Benefit_. The term " ** _Title Benefit_** " means any right,
circumstance or condition that operates (i) to increase Sellers Net Revenue
Interest in any Well or Lease above that set forth in _Exhibit A_, _Schedule
1_ or _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 2_ for such Well or Lease, as applicable, and in
the case of a Well, without causing a greater than proportionate increase in
Sellers Working Interest for such Well or (ii) to increase the number of net
mineral acres attributable to any Lease above that set forth in _Exhibit A_,
_Schedule 1_.

 



 

5.6.2 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) Buyer may review title to the Wells and Leases prior to Closing and Buyer
shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to notify Seller in writing of
any Title Defect it discovers on or before December 20, 2016 (the " ** _Title
Claim Date_** "). To be effective, such notice shall be in writing and shall
include: (i) a reasonably detailed description of the alleged Title Defect(s);
(ii) the portion of the Property affected; (iii) the Allocated Value of the
portion of the Property subject to the alleged Title Defect(s); (iv)
supporting documents in Buyers possession reasonably necessary for Seller (as
well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the
existence of the alleged Title Defect(s); and (v) the amount by which Buyer
reasonably believes the Allocated Value of the applicable portion of the
Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations and
information upon which Buyers belief is based. Subject to and without
limiting the Special Warranty, Buyer shall be deemed to have conclusively
waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any Title Defects of which
Seller has not been given timely notice on or before the Title Claim Date in
accordance with the requirements of this _Section 5.6.2_.

 



 

(b) On or before the Title Claim Date, Seller shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to deliver to Buyer written notice of any Title Benefits on or
prior to the Title Claim Date and such notice shall include: (i) a reasonably
detailed description of the Title

 



      
 

 



 

Benefit(s); (ii) the Well or Lease affected; (iii) the Allocated Value of the
Well or Lease subject to such Title Benefit(s); (iv) supporting documents in
Sellers possession reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify the existence of
the alleged Title Benefit(s), and (v) the amount by which Seller reasonably
believes the Allocated Value of the affected Well or Lease is increased by the
Title Benefit(s) and the computations and information upon which Sellers
belief is based. If Buyer discovers any Title Benefit during its due diligence
review, then Buyer shall promptly (but in no event less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Title Claim Date) provide informal written notice of such
Title Benefit to Seller on or before the Title Claim Date. Seller shall be
deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which Seller has not given notice
in compliance with this _Section 5.6.2(b)_ on or before the Title Claim Date.

 



 

(c) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure or remove on or before the Closing Date any Title Defects
of which it has been advised by Buyer prior to the Title Claim Date. If Seller
has commenced to cure such a Title Defect prior to the Closing Date and is
pursuing that cure diligently, Seller may elect to continue attempting to cure
such Title Defect until the Final Settlement Date, but must provide Buyer
notice of such election at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. If Seller elects to attempt to cure any Title Defects pursuant to this
_Section 5.6.2(c)_, at Closing, Buyer shall deposit an amount equal to the
Title Defect Value of all such Title Defects (as asserted in good faith by
Buyer) into an escrow account established with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to
the terms of a mutually agreeable escrow agreement, pending agreement by the
Parties that the Title Defect has been cured or resolution under _Section
5.6.2(i)_. Sellers election to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall not
constitute a waiver of Sellers right to dispute the existence, nature or
value of, or cost to cure, the Title Defect.

 



 

(d) Sellers interest in each Well or Lease affected by Title Defects properly
reported under _Section 5.6.2(a)_ and not cured prior to the Closing Date
shall be assigned to Buyer at Closing subject to all such uncured Title
Defects. If Seller has not provided notice under _Section 5.6.2(c)_ of its
election to continue attempting to cure a Title Defect, the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted by an amount (the " ** _Title Defect Value_** ") equal to
the reduction in the Allocated Value for the affected Well or Lease caused by
such Title Defect, as determined pursuant to _Section 5.6.2(f)_. If Seller
has provided such notice under _Section 5.6.2(c)_, no Purchase Price
reduction shall be made until the Final Settlement Date, at which time, if the
Title Defect remains uncured, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Title
Defect Value. Should the cumulative Title Defect Values with respect to any
Well or Lease equal the entire Allocated Value for the affected Property,
Buyer shall, within ten (10) days of any such determination, reconvey to
Seller all of its rights with respect to such Well or Lease by conveyance
without warranty (other than a special warranty of title by, through or under
Buyer, but not otherwise) and the Purchase Price shall be decreased in the
Final Settlement by the entire Allocated Value for such re-conveyed Well or
Lease.

 



 

(e) With respect to each Well or Lease affected by Title Benefits reported
under _Section 5.6.2(b)_ (or of which Buyer had Knowledge and should have
reported under _Section 5.6.2(b)_), the aggregate Title Defect Value for all
Title Defects for which Buyer is entitled to a remedy under _Section
5.6.2(d)_ shall be decreased by an amount (the " ** _Title Benefit Value_** ")
equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Well or Lease caused by
such Title

 



      
 

 



 

Benefits, as determined pursuant to _Section 5.6.2(g)_. The remedy described
in this _Section 5.6.2(e)_ shall be Sellers sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any Title Benefits.

 



 

(f) The Title Defect Value resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
as follows:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Value, that amount shall be
the Title Defect Value;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Value shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from Sellers interest;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect is of the type described in _Section
5.6.1(a)(2)(i)_, then the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the
Allocated Value for such Well, multiplied by (y) one (1) minus (z) a fraction,
the numerator of which is Sellers actual Net Revenue Interest for such Well
in the currently producing formations and the denominator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest for such Well set forth in _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 2_,
provided, however, that if the Title Defect does not affect such Well
throughout the entire remaining life of such Well, the Title Defect Value so
determined shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period
only;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect is of the type described in _Section
5.6.1(a)(2)(ii)_, then the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the
diminution in value of such Well in the currently producing formations based
on the Allocated Value for such Well and resulting from the increase in such
Working Interest in the currently producing formations over the life of the
Well;

 



 

(v) if the Title Defect is of the type described in _Section
5.6.1(a)(2)(iii)_, then the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the
product of (y) the Allocated Value of such Lease multiplied by (z) one (1),
minus a fraction, the numerator of which is Sellers actual net mineral acres
covered by such Lease (with respect to the Target Depth) and the denominator
of which is the net mineral acres for such Lease (with respect to the Target
Depth) set forth in _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 1_ ;

 



 

(vi) if the Title Defect is of the type described in _Section
5.6.1(a)(2)(iv)_, then the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the
product of (y) the Allocated Value of such Lease multiplied by (z) one (1),
minus a fraction, the numerator of which is Sellers actual Net Revenue
Interest for such Lease (with respect to the Target Depth) and the denominator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest for such Lease (with respect to the
Target Depth) set forth in _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 1_;

 



 

(vii) if the Title Defect is of a type not described above, then, in each
case, the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Well or Lease so affected, the portion of Sellers
interest in the Well or Lease affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect
of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over
the life of the affected Well or Lease, the values placed upon the Title
Defect by

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation; and

 



 

(viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.6_, Buyer
shall have no remedy hereunder for any Title Defect unless: (A) the Title
Defect Value for such Title Defect exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000)
net to Sellers interest in the relevant Well or Lease (the " ** _Title Defect
Threshold_** "), in which event the value of such defect will be taken into
account from first dollar; and (B) the sum of the aggregate Title Defect
Values for Title Defects with Title Defect Values exceeding the Title Defect
Threshold exceeds two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price, and then only to the
extent such amount exceeds two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price.

 



 

(g) The Title Benefit Value for any Title Benefit shall be determined as
follows:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefits Amount, that amount shall
be the Title Benefit Value;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Benefit is of the type described in _Section 5.6.1(c)(i)_,
then the Title Benefit Value shall be an amount equal to the Allocated Value
for such Well or Lease, multiplied by the proportionate increase in such Net
Revenue Interest (i.e., the amount by which Sellers actual Net Revenue
Interest is more than the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Well or
Lease on _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 1_ or _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 2_ , divided by
the Net Revenue Interest set forth on _Exhibit A_, _Schedule 1_ or _Exhibit
A_, _Schedule 2_ , as applicable), provided, however, that if the Title
Benefit does not affect such Well or Lease throughout the entire remaining
life of such Well or Lease, the Title Benefit Value so determined shall be
reduced to take into account the applicable time period only; or

 



 

(iii) for any other Title Benefits the Title Benefit Value shall be determined
by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Well or Lease so affected,
the portion of Sellers interest in the Well or Lease affected by the Title
Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential economic effect
of the Title Benefit over the life of the affected Well or Lease, the values
placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller and such other factors as
are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 



 

(h) Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree prior to the Closing Date on all:
(i) Title Defect Values for Title Defects properly asserted prior to the Title
Claim Date that Seller elected not to or was unable to cure (except with
respect to Title Defects for which Seller provides notice of its election to
continue attempting to cure after the Closing Date under _Section 5.6.2(c)_);
and (ii) Title Benefit Values. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by that
date, an amount equal to the average (the " ** _Title Defect Value Average_**
") of (A) the Title Defect Value claimed in good faith by Seller and (B) the
Title Defect Value claimed in good faith by Buyer shall be used to determine
the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing; and the Title Defect Values and
Title Benefit Values in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
expert determination pursuant to _Section 5.6.2(i)_. Likewise, if by the
Final Settlement Date, Seller has failed to cure any Title Defects reported
prior to the Title Claim Date with respect to which it provided notice of its
election to continue attempting to cure under _Section 5.6.2(c)_, and Seller
and Buyer have been unable to agree on the Title Defect Values for such Title
Defects, the Title

 



      
 

 



 

Defect Value Average shall be used in the Final Settlement Statement, and the
Title Defect Values in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
expert determination pursuant to _Section 5.6.2(i)_.

 



 

(i) During the ten (10) Business Day period following the Closing Date or
following the Final Settlement Date, as applicable, disputed Title Defects,
Title Benefits, cures, and Title Defect Values and Title Benefit Values shall
be submitted to a title attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in
oil and gas titles as selected by: (y) mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller;
or (z) absent such agreement during the ten (10) Business Day period, by the
Dallas office of the American Arbitration Association (the " ** _Title
Consultant_** "). The Title Consultant shall not have been employed by any
party or its Affiliates within the five (5) year period preceding the
arbitration. The Title Consultant, once appointed, shall have no ex parte
communications with any of the parties concerning the determination required
hereunder. All communications between any party or its Affiliates and the
Title Consultant shall be conducted in writing, with copies sent
simultaneously to the other party in the same manner, or at a meeting or
conference call to which the representatives of both Seller and Buyer have
been invited and of which such parties have been provided at least five (5)
days notice. Within ten (10) days of appointment of the Title Consultant,
each of Seller and Buyer shall present the Title Consultant with its claim
notice or its response, as applicable, and all other supporting information
that it desires, with a copy to the other party. The Title Consultant shall
also be provided with a copy of this Agreement. Within forty-five (45) days
after receipt of such materials and after receipt of any additional
information required by the Title Consultant, the Title Consultant shall make
its determination, which shall be final and binding upon all parties, without
right of appeal, absent manifest error. In making his determination, the Title
Consultant shall be bound by the rules set forth in this _Section 5.6_. In no
event shall any Title Defect Value exceed the estimate given by Buyer in its
claim notice delivered in accordance with _Section 5.6.2(a)_, and in no event
shall any Title Benefit Value exceed any estimate given by Seller or Buyer in
a claim notice delivered in accordance with _Section 5.6.2(b)_. The Title
Consultant shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining: (A)
the existence of any timely and properly asserted Title Defect or Title
Benefit in dispute; (B) whether or to the extent to which any disputed
curative action has succeeded in curing a Title Defect; and (C) specific
disputed Title Defect Values or Title Benefit Values submitted by either
party. The Title Consultant may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its
own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-
half (1/2) and Buyer shall bear one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses of
the Title Consultant.

 



 

5.6.3 __Exclusive Remedy__. Except for the Special Warranty, the remedies set
forth in this _Section 5.6_ are Buyers exclusive remedies under this
Agreement for all title defects (including Title Defects), and Seller shall
have no other liability to Buyer with respect to title defects (including
Title Defects).

 



 

5.7 **_Casualty Losses and Government Takings_**.

 



 

5.7.1 _Notice of Casualty Losses and Government Takings_. If, prior to the
Closing Date, all or a portion of the Property is damaged or destroyed by
fire, flood, storm, or other accident (" ** _Casualty Loss_** "), or is taken
in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain, or if proceedings for
such purposes shall be pending or threatened (" ** _Government_**

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Taking_** "), Seller must promptly notify Buyer in writing of the nature
and extent of the Casualty Loss or Government Taking and Sellers estimate of
the cost required to repair or replace that portion of the Property affected
by the Casualty Loss or value of the Property taken by the Government Taking.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no individual matter described above shall be
deemed to be or constitute a Casualty Loss unless the estimate of the cost
required to repair or replace that portion of the Property affected by the
Casualty Loss for such matter exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000),
net to Sellers interest in the affected portion of the Property, and no
Casualty Loss or Government Taking will be considered a Title Defect under
_Section 5.6_.

 



 

5.7.2 _Remedies for Casualty Losses and Government Takings_. With respect to
each Casualty Loss to or Government Taking of the Property, Seller and Buyer
will have the following rights and remedies:

 



 

(a) Subject to Buyers termination right under _Section 5.8_, the parties
will proceed with Closing and Seller shall elect either: (i) to make a
downward adjustment to the Purchase Price by the lower of Sellers estimate of
the cost to repair or replace that portion of the Property affected by the
Casualty Loss or the Government Taking or the Allocated Value of the Property
subject to the Casualty Loss or taken in the Government Taking, or (ii) if
Buyer agrees (in its sole discretion), indemnify Buyer through a document
reasonably acceptable to Seller and Buyer against actual costs or expenses
that Buyer reasonably incurs to repair or replace the portion of the Property
affected by the Casualty Loss or the Government Taking, such amount not to
exceed the Allocated Value for such Property. In the event that any Property
is repaired or replaced under clause (ii) above and the repaired or replaced
Property is newer than the Property that was damaged, destroyed or taken, or
otherwise represents an upgrade from the Property that was damaged, destroyed
or taken, Buyer shall bear the portion of the cost of repair or replacement
attributable to the reduction in age or increase in quality.

 



 

(b) In addition to the remedies set forth in _Section 5.7.2(a)_, Seller and
Buyer will have the termination rights in connection with Casualty Losses and
Government Takings set forth in _Section 5.8_.

 



 

5.7.3 _Insurance Proceeds and Settlement Payments_. In each case under
subparts (a) and (b) of _Section 5.7.2_, Seller will be entitled to (a) all
insurance proceeds with respect to any such Casualty Loss, (b) all sums paid
to Seller or Buyer by third Persons by reason of any such Casualty Loss, and
(c) all compensation paid to Seller or Buyer with respect to any such
Government Taking.

 



 

5.7.4 _Change in Condition_. Buyer will assume all risk and loss with respect
to any change in the condition of the Property from and after the Effective
Time for production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including the
watering-out, casing collapse or sand infiltration of any Well), the
depreciation of personal property through ordinary wear and tear, and changes
arising from Sellers operations conducted in accordance with _Article 10_.
None of the events or conditions set forth in this _Section 5.7.4_ will be
considered a Casualty Loss or Title Defect with respect to the Property, nor
will they be cause for any other reduction in the Purchase Price, or give rise
to any right to terminate this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

5.8 **_Termination Due to Impairments to the Property_**. If the sum of (i)
all Title Defect Values for Title Defects asserted in good-faith by Buyer
pursuant to _Section 5.6.2(a)_ that remain uncured at Closing, less the sum
of all Title Benefit Values, plus (ii) all Environmental Defect Values for
Adverse Environmental Conditions asserted in good-faith by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 5.3.3_, plus (iii) the Allocated Values of any Property excluded
pursuant to _Section 5.3.4(a)(iii) _and _Section 5.5 _and/or pursuant to a
Governmental Taking, plus (iv) the value of all Casualty Losses that occur
after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, exceeds twenty percent
(20%) of the Purchase Price, then either Seller or Buyer may terminate this
Agreement, and neither party will have any further obligation to conclude the
transfer of the Property under this Agreement; provided, however, that Buyers
indemnity obligations under _Section 5.2_ and _Section 8.3.3_ and the
obligations under _Section 11.3 _shall survive such termination. Any party
exercising a right of termination under this _Section 5.8_ must notify the
other party in writing no later than one (1) Business Day before the Scheduled
Closing Date of its election to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 5.8_.

 



 

5.9 **_Hart-Scott-Rodino Compliance_**. The consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement is subject in all respects to and conditioned
upon compliance by the parties with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and rules and regulations promulgated
pursuant thereto (the " ** _Hart-Scott-Rodino Act_** "), to the extent that
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is applicable to the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement. Buyer and Seller agree to (or to cause its applicable
Affiliate to) make such filings with, and provide such information to, the
Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice with respect to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as are required in connection with
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act within ten (10) Business Days after the Execution
Date. Buyer agrees to use its best efforts and to take promptly any and all
steps and actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
that may be asserted by any governmental authority (including, but not limited
to, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice) with respect
to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing
to occur on the timeframe contemplated by this Agreement. If filing a
Notification and Report Form for the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement is required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, Buyer and Seller each
agree (i) to request (or cause its applicable Affiliate to request) early
termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, (ii) to
respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the Federal
Trade Commission or the Department of Justice for additional information or

give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. Buyer shall
solely bear the cost of any filing fees under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

will not be entitled to make a Claim against Seller: (1) in connection with
any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties

of indemnification set forth in _Section 5.2_, _Section 5.3.4_, _Section

exclusive remedy of the parties to this Agreement and all indemnified parties
for the breach of any representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement, and each party hereto covenants and agrees not to
seek or assert any other remedy with respect thereto following Closing;

hereto to seek any equitable remedy available to enforce the rights of such
party under this Agreement.

 



 

8.11 **_Treatment of Indemnity Payments_**. Any payment pursuant to this
_Article 8_ shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 9**

 

 **TAXES AND EXPENSES**

 



 

9.1 **_Recording Expenses_**. Buyer shall pay all costs of recording and
filing the Assignment for the Property, all other state and federal transfer
documents, and all other instruments that must be filed to effectuate the

9.2 **_Asset Taxes_**.

 



 

9.2.1 Seller shall retain responsibility for, and shall bear and pay, all ad
valorem, property, excise, sales, use severance, production or similar Taxes
(including any interest, fine, penalty or additions to Tax imposed by a
governmental authority in connection with such Taxes) based upon operation or
ownership of the Properties or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom (" **
_Asset Taxes_** ") for (i) any period ending prior to the Effective Time, and
(ii) the portion of any Tax period beginning before and ending after the
Effective Time (a " ** _Straddle Period_** ") ending immediately prior to the
Effective Time. All Asset Taxes with respect to the ownership or operation of
the Properties arising on or after the Effective Time (including all Straddle
Period Asset Taxes not apportioned to Seller) shall be allocated to and borne
by Buyer. Upon determination of the actual amount of Asset Taxes, to the
extent not taken into account under _Section 2.2_, payments will be made to
cause the appropriate party to bear the Asset Taxes allocable to such Person
under this _Section 9.2.1_. For purposes of allocation between the parties of
Asset Taxes that are payable with respect to Straddle Periods, the portion of
any such Taxes that are attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
that ends immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (A) in the case of
Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a
transactional basis, be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if
the Tax year or period ended immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (B)
in the case of other Taxes, be allocated pro rata per day between the period
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the period beginning on the
Effective Time. For purposes of

 



      
 

 



 

clause (A) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or
other item that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated pro rata
per day between the period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time and
the period beginning on the Effective Time.

 



 

9.2.2 To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time
an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to
_Section 2.2 _or _Section 2.3_, as applicable, the parties shall utilize the
most recent information available in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax
for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of an Asset
Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a party) is
ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken
into account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant
to _Section 2.3_, timely payments will be made from one party to the other to
the extent necessary to cause each party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax
that is allocable to such party under _Section 9.2.1_.

 



 

9.2.3 Seller shall timely file any Tax Return with respect to Asset Taxes due
on or before the Closing Date or that otherwise relates solely to periods
before the Closing Date (a " ** _Pre-Closing Tax Return_** ") and shall pay
any Asset Taxes shown due and owing on such Pre-Closing Asset Tax Return,
subject to Sellers right of reimbursement for any Asset Taxes for which Buyer
is responsible under _Section 9.2.1_. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall timely file any Tax Returns with respect to Asset Taxes required to be
filed after the Closing Date, including such Tax Returns for any Straddle
Period that are due after the Closing Date (a " ** _Post-Closing Tax Return_**
"), and shall pay any Asset Taxes shown due and owing on such Post-Closing Tax
Return, subject to Buyers right of reimbursement for any Asset Taxes for
which Seller is responsible under _Section 9.2.1_. Buyer shall file any Post-
Closing Tax Return relating to a Straddle Period in a manner consistent with
past practice. Within fifteen (15) days prior to filing, Buyer shall deliver
to Seller a draft of any such Post-Closing Tax Return for Sellers review and
approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

9.3 **_Cooperation_**. At the expense of the requesting party, Buyer and
Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon request,
as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the
Properties, including, without limitation, access to books and records and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, as
is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by Buyer or Seller,
the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by
any Taxing authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax. Each of Buyer and Seller shall retain all
books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Properties for a
period of at least seven (7) years following the Closing Date.

 



 

9.4 **_Notice_**. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing upon receipt
by Seller of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments
relating to the income, properties or operations of Seller that reasonably may
be expected to relate to or give rise to a lien, encumbrance or other charge
on the Property. Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly notify the other in
writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or
assessment challenging the Allocation.

 



       
 

 



 

9.5 **_Transfer Taxes_**. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (" ** _Transfer Taxes_** ") will be borne by
Buyer.

 



 

9.6 **_Income Taxes_**. Each party shall be responsible for its own state and
federal income taxes, if any, as may result from this transaction.

 



 

9.7 **_Incidental Expenses_**. Each party shall bear its own respective

transaction, including its own consultants fees, attorneys fees,

11.5.1 Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other, except (a) as expressly
provided in _Section 2.8_ and (b) except for any assignment by Buyer, in
whole or in part, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement prior to
the Closing to any one or more of its Affiliates; provided, however, that no
such assignment shall release Buyer from its obligations hereunder or
Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty. If Buyer sells, transfers
or assigns all or a portion of the Property this Agreement shall remain in
effect between Buyer and Seller as to the Property, regardless of such sale or
assignment (and Buyer will remain obligated hereunder). From and after the
date of any assignment by Buyer permitted pursuant to clause (b) above, the
term " ** _Buyer_** " shall refer to, or include, the applicable assignee, as
the context requires; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, no
such assignment shall release Buyer from its obligations hereunder or
Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty.

 



 

11.5.2 Upon the assignment by Buyer of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.5.1(b)_, the representations, warranties,
covenants and conditions applicable to Buyer as set forth in this Agreement
shall apply to the applicable assignee _mutatis mutandis_.

 



 

11.6 **_Entire Agreement and Amendment_**. This Agreement constitutes the
entire understanding between the parties, replacing and superseding all prior
negotiations, discussions, arrangements, agreements and understandings between
the parties regarding the subject transaction and subject matter hereof
(whether written or oral), excepting any written agreements that may be
executed by the parties concurrently or after the execution of this Agreement.
No other agreement, statement, or promise made by any party, or to any
employee, officer or agent of any party, which is not contained in this
Agreement shall be binding or valid. This Agreement may be amended, modified,
altered, supplemented or revoked only by written agreement signed by duly
authorized representatives of each of the parties hereto.

 



 

11.7 **_Successors and Assigns_**. This Agreement binds and inures to the
benefit of the parties hereto their respective successors and permitted
assigns, and all the terms, provisions, covenants, obligations, indemnities,
representations, warranties and conditions of this Agreement shall be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 



 

11.8 **_Third Party Beneficiaries_**. It is understood and agreed that there
shall be no third-Person beneficiary of this Agreement, and that the
provisions hereof do not impart enforceable benefits, rights or remedies in
anyone who is not a party or a successor or assignee of a party hereto, except
that the Persons specified in _Section 8.2.1_ are intended third-Person
beneficiaries of all indemnity provisions set forth in this Agreement but only
a party will have the right to enforce such indemnity provisions on behalf of
any such Person.

 



 

11.9 **_Severability_**. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any of Seller or Buyer. Upon such determination that any
term or other

 



      
 

 



 

provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

 



 

11.10 **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall constitute an original and all of which shall constitute one
document.

 



 

11.11 **_Governing Law_**. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF
THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED, CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICTS-OF-LAW RULE OR
PRINCIPLE THAT MIGHT APPLY THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. EACH OF THE
PARTIES CONSENT TO THE EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION IN PERSONAM BY THE FEDERAL
DISTRICT COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS FOR ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO, ARISING DIRECTLY OR

are made a part of this Agreement for all purposes. In the event of a conflict

this Agreement shall take precedence. In the event of a conflict or
inconsistency between the provisions of the pro forma Assignment and other
transaction documents attached to this Agreement as Exhibits or Schedules and
the Assignment and other transaction documents actually executed by the
parties, the provisions of the executed Assignment and other executed
transaction documents shall take precedence.

 



 

11.13 **_Waiver_**. Any of the terms, provisions, covenants, representations,
warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a written instrument
executed by the party waiving compliance. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the failure of any party at any time or times to
require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect such
partys right to enforce the same. No waiver by any party of any condition, or
of the breach of any term, provision, covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or
more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing
waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or
of the breach of any other term, provision, covenant, representation or
warranty.

 



 

11.14 **_Interpretation_**. The parties stipulate and agree that this
Agreement shall be deemed and considered for all purposes to have been jointly
prepared by the parties, and shall

 



      
 

 



 

not be construed against any one party (nor shall any inference or presumption
be made) on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular

obligated to close because of the provisions set forth in _Section 6.2.1(a)_,
_Section 6.2.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2.5(a) _and Seller terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.5(c)_, then Seller shall be entitled to the
Performance Deposit as agreed liquidated damages not as a penalty (and the
parties shall promptly provide the Escrow Agent with joint written
instructions to release the

upon the termination of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to _Section
6.5(c)_, and Seller hereby expressly waives and releases all other remedies
(except as provided in _Section 11.15.4_). THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND
AGREE THAT THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES TO SELLER OCCASIONED BY THE FAILURE OF THIS
TRANSACTION TO BE CONSUMMATED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO
ASCERTAIN AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE PERFORMANCE DEPOSIT IS A FAIR AND
REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE A PENALTY.

 



 

11.15.2 _Buyer s Remedies_. If, as of the Outside Date, Buyer is not
obligated to close because of the provisions set forth in _Section 6.2.1(b),
Section 6.2.2(b)_ or _Section 6.2.5(b) _and Buyer terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 6.5(b), _then Buyer shall receive back the Performance
Deposit from the Escrow Agent (and the parties shall promptly provide the
Escrow Agent with joint written instructions to release the Performance
Deposit to Buyer) and have the right to seek actual damages from Seller for
Sellers breach of this Agreement. Subject to _Section 11.15.5_, the remedy
set forth in this _Section 11.15.2_ shall be Buyers sole and exclusive
remedy upon the termination of this Agreement by Buyer pursuant to _Section
6.5(b)_, and Buyer hereby expressly waives and releases all other remedies
(except as provided in _Section 11.15.4_).

 



 

11.15.3 _Performance Deposit_. Except as provided in _Section 11.15.1 _or
_Section 11.15.2_, upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.5_, Buyer shall be entitled to a return of the Performance Deposit
and the parties shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent

law, it may seek specific performance of this Agreement.

 



 

11.16 **_Waiver of Right to Rescission_**. Following the Closing, Buyer and
Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

11.17 **_Seller s Representative_**. Silverback Operating has and does hereby
irrevocably appoint Silverback (the " ** _Seller s Representative_**") the
agent and attorney-in-fact for Silverback Operating for the purposes of acting
in the name and stead of Silverback Operating in: (a) giving and receiving all
notices permitted or required by this Agreement; (b) the making of adjustments

 



       
 

 



 

to the Purchase Price; (c) the allocating and distributing among Silverback
Operating and Silverback of adjustments to the Purchase Price and any other
payments (other than the Purchase Price) due to Seller; (d) entering into
agreements with Buyer as to any amendments to this Agreement, which the
Sellers Representative may deem necessary or advisable, including but not
limited to the extension of time in which to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (e) the waiver of any closing conditions of
Seller and (f) determining any Title Defect Values or Environmental Defect
Values and/or the resolution of any Title Defects or Adverse Environmental
Condition. Each entity comprising Seller, however, shall execute and deliver
its respective Assignment and closing deliverables at Closing. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Sellers Representative shall be solely
responsible for properly distributing among the Seller any adjustments to the
Purchase Price and any other payments due Seller, and Buyer shall have no
liability whatsoever related to such distributions or allocation or the timing
thereof. By executing this Agreement, the Sellers Representative hereby
accepts its appointment and authorization to act as Sellers Representative
and attorney-in-fact and agent on behalf of each entity comprising Seller in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each entity comprising Seller
acknowledges that this appointment is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable, and each entity comprising Seller further acknowledges that Buyer
and any other person shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken by
the Sellers Representative under this Agreement.

 



 

11.18 **_Waiver of Consumer Rights_**. AS PARTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR THE
PARTIES ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS
OF THE TEXAS DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, ARTICLE 17.41
ET SEQ., TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, A LAW THAT GIVES CONSUMERS SPECIAL
RIGHTS AND PROTECTION, AND ALL OTHER CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS OF THE STATE OF
TEXAS, OR OF ANY OTHER STATE, THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO THIS TRANSACTION, THAT
MAY BE WAIVED BY SUCH PARTY. IT IS NOT THE INTENT OF EITHER PARTY TO WAIVE,
AND NEITHER PARTY DOES HEREBY WAIVE, ANY LAW OR PROVISION THEREOF THAT IS
PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM BEING WAIVED. EACH PARTY REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS HAD AN
ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE PRECEDING WAIVER PROVISION, INCLUDING THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT THE SAME TO LEGAL COUNSEL FOR REVIEW AND ADVICE AND
AFTER CONSULTATION WITH AN ATTORNEY OF ITS OWN SELECTION VOLUNTARILY CONSENTS
TO THIS WAIVER, AND UNDERSTANDS THE RIGHTS BEING WAIVED HEREIN.

 



 

11.19 **_SEC Filings_**. From and after the Execution Date until two (2) years
following the Closing Date (the " ** _Records Period_** "), Seller shall, and
shall use reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives and its
auditors and independent reserve engineers to, provide reasonable cooperation
to Buyer, its Affiliates and their agents and representatives in connection
with Buyers or its Affiliates filings, if any, that are required by the SEC
under securities laws applicable to Buyer and its applicable Affiliates
(collectively, the " ** _Filings_** "). During the Records Period, Seller
agrees to make available to Buyer and its Affiliates and their agents and
representatives any and all non-privileged books, records, information and
documents in Sellers possession or control that are attributable to the
Property that Seller is permitted to make available, and reasonable access to
Sellers and its Affiliates personnel, in each case as

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably requested by Buyer, its Affiliates and their agents and
representatives in order for Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective
representatives to prepare (at Buyers or its Affiliates sole cost and
expense), if required, in connection with the Filings, financial statements
meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, along
with any non-privileged documentation in Sellers possession or control that
is attributable to the Property that Seller is permitted to make available and
is required for Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective representatives to
(at Buyers or its Affiliates sole cost and expense) complete any audit
associated with such financial statements. During the Records Period, Seller
shall, and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates, auditors and
independent reserve engineers, as applicable, (a) provide reasonable
cooperation to (i) the independent auditors and accounting consultants chosen
by Buyer (" ** _Buyer s Auditor_**") in connection with any audit by Buyers
Auditor of any financial statements of Seller or its Affiliates with respect
to the Property and (ii) the independent reserve engineers of Buyer (" **
_Buyer s Reserve Engineer_**") in connection with the preparation by Buyers
Reserve Engineer of a reserve and estimated present value determination with
respect to the Property, in each case that Buyer or any of its Affiliates
requires to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to any Filings, and (b) use
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Buyer "comfort letters" to the
underwriters in any offering of securities for which such comfort letters are
required by underwriters with regard to certain financial or reserve
information relating to the Property, as the case may be, in customary form
and customary in scope and substance for "comfort" letters delivered by
independent public accountants and reserve engineers in connection with any
offering of securities and to use reasonable efforts to cause Sellers auditor
and independent reserve engineer to consent to inclusion of the information
described in this _Section 11.19_ in the Filings and to be named therein.
During the Records Period, Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all books,
records, information and documents relating to Seller from November 20, 2013
through the Closing Date. Buyer will fully reimburse Seller and its Affiliates
and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and
representatives and auditors and independent reserve engineers, in each case
within ten (10) business days after demand in writing therefor, for any and
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates or any
of their officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives
and auditors and independent reserve engineers in complying or attempting to
comply with the provision of this _Section 11.19_ or that are otherwise taken
at the request of Buyer or any of its Affiliates in connection with any of the
matters described in this _Section 11.19_.

 **FORM OF RIVERSTONE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT**

 



 

[see attached]

 



 

Exhibit C-1     
 

 



 

 **Execution Version**

 



 

 **SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT**

 



 

This SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT is entered into this 27th day of November, 2016
(this " _Subscription Agreement_ "), by and between Centennial Resource
Development, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and Riverstone
Silverback Holdings, L.P. (" _Subscriber_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, SB RS Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _SB RS
Holdings_ "), has entered into that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated
as of November 21, 2016 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), pursuant to which SB
RS Holdings will acquire certain assets (the " _Transferred Property_ ") from
Silverback Exploration, LLC and Silverback Operating, LLC, each a Delaware
limited liability company (collectively " _Silverback_ "), on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein;

 



 

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 11.5 of the Purchase Agreement, SB RS Holdings
has the right to assign (the " _Assignment_ ") all of its rights and
obligations under the Purchase Agreement to Centennial Resource Production,
LLC, a controlled subsidiary of the Company (the " _Purchaser_ "), and the
Purchaser, upon such Assignment, would acquire the Transferred Property
instead of SB RS Holdings, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein (the " _Transaction_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, SB RS Holdings, Riverstone Capital Services LLC, the Company and the
Purchaser have entered into that certain Agreement to Assign, dated as of
November 27, 2016 (the " _Agreement to Assign_ "), pursuant to which SB RS
Holdings has agreed to make the Assignment, and the Purchaser has agreed to
accept the Assignment, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein;

 



 

WHEREAS, to finance a portion of the Transaction, Subscriber desires to
subscribe for and purchase from the Company (a) an aggregate of approximately
$400 million in (i) shares (the " _Class A Acquired Shares_") of the
Companys Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Class A
Common Stock_"), at a purchase price of $14.54 per share, subject to
adjustment under Section 1(c) below, and (ii) shares (the " _Series B
Acquired Shares_") of the Companys convertible Series B Preferred Stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (the " _Series B Preferred Stock_"), at a purchase
price of $ 3,635.00 per share (or $14.54 per share on an as-converted basis),
subject to adjustment under Section 1(c) below, and (b) at Subscribers
election after consultation with the Company, up to an additional
approximately $100 million in additional shares of Class A Common Stock and/or
Series B Preferred Stock, as mutually agreed by Subscriber and the Company, at
the respective purchase prices set forth in clause (a) above (the "
_Additional Acquired Shares_ " and, together with the Class A Acquired Shares
and the Series B Acquired Shares, the " _Acquired Shares_ "; and as used
herein, unless the context otherwise requires, Class A Acquired Shares, Series
B Acquired Shares and Acquired Shares shall be deemed to refer to and include
the Conversion Shares (as defined below)), or, with respect to all such
Acquired Shares, the aggregate amount set forth on Subscribers signature page
hereto (the " _Purchase Price_ "), such allocation between Class A Acquired
Shares and Class B Acquired Shares and the final number of Additional Acquired
Shares to be determined in accordance with Section 1 below, and the Company
desires to issue and sell to Subscriber the Acquired Shares in

      
 

 



 

consideration of the payment of the Purchase Price by or on behalf of
Subscriber to the Company on or prior to the Closing Date (as defined below);

 



 

WHEREAS, the Series B Preferred Stock will have the terms set forth on Annex B
hereto, including the automatic conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock
into shares of Class A Common Stock on a 250-for-one basis, subject to
adjustment as provided therein, upon approval by the stockholders of the
Company of the issuance of such shares of Class A Common Stock, as required by
the rules of The NASDAQ Capital Market ("NASDAQ"); and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company may, but is not obligated to, finance any of the
remaining portion of the purchase price for the Transaction (the " _Remaining
Purchase Price_ ") by issuing additional shares of its common stock or
preferred stock pursuant to subscription agreements substantially similar to
this Subscription Agreement (any such agreements, the " _Other Subscription
Agreements_ ").

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants, and subject to the conditions,
herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Subscription_.

 



 

a. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Subscriber hereby agrees to
subscribe for and purchase, and the Company hereby agrees to issue and sell to
Subscriber, upon the payment of the Purchase Price, the Acquired Shares (such
subscription and issuance, the " _Subscription_ ").

 



 

b. On or prior to the date on which any Other Subscription Agreement, if any,
is entered into, after consultation with the Company, Subscriber shall notify
the Company of the number of Additional Acquired Shares constituting "Acquired
Shares" hereunder that Subscriber shall elect and be obligated to purchase on
the Closing Date as provided herein, which notice shall include the allocation
of Class A Acquired Shares and Series B Acquired Shares constituting the
"Acquired Shares" (including the Additional Acquired Shares) to be purchased
hereunder (the " _Total Acquired Shares_ "); _provided_ that the maximum
number of Class A Acquired Shares to be purchased hereunder (the " _Maximum
Share Number_ "), together with any additional shares of Class A Common Stock
to be issued by the Company pursuant to all Other Subscription Agreements, if
any, in the aggregate, does not exceed 19.9% of the Companys outstanding
shares of Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock (as defined below), on
a combined basis, on the date hereof, and, to the extent the Maximum Share
Number would be exceeded by issuing all Acquired Shares as shares of Class A
Common Stock, Subscriber shall instead be obligated to purchase, and the
Company shall be obligated to issue to Subscriber, that number of Series B
Acquired Shares that, together with the number of Class A Acquired Shares to
be purchased hereunder, equals the number of Total Acquired Shares to be
purchased hereunder. At such time, Subscriber and the Company shall update and
amend Subscribers signature page hereto to reflect the number of Acquired
Shares to be purchased, and the aggregate Purchase Price to be paid, on the
Closing Date as provided herein.

 



      
 

 



 

c. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if the Company
determines to finance any portion of the Remaining Purchase Price by issuing
additional shares of its common stock or preferred stock to one or more
additional purchasers (the " _Other Purchasers_ ") pursuant to any Other
Subscription Agreement or otherwise at a price per share less than the
Purchase Price payable by Subscriber hereunder, then Subscribers Purchase
Price shall be reduced to equal the lowest per share purchase price to be paid
by any such Other Purchaser (including on an as-converted basis for any shares
of Series B Preferred Stock).

 



 

2. _Closing_.

 



 

a. The closing of the Subscription contemplated hereby (the "Closing") is
contingent upon the substantially concurrent consummation of the Transaction
and shall occur immediately prior thereto. The Closing and the closing of the
Transaction shall occur on December 30, 2016, subject to extension upon five
(5) business days prior written notice to Subscriber (such date, including as
so extended, the " _Closing Date_ "). At least three (3) business days prior
to the Closing Date, Subscriber shall deliver to the Company, to be held in
escrow until the Closing, the Purchase Price for the Acquired Shares by wire
transfer of U.S. dollars in immediately available funds to the account
specified by the Company in Annex B hereto. Immediately prior to the closing
of the Transaction on the Closing Date, (a) the Purchase Price shall be
released from escrow automatically and without further action by the Company
or Subscriber, and (b) upon such release, the Company shall deliver to
Subscriber (i) the Acquired Shares in book entry form, free and clear of any
liens or other restrictions whatsoever (other than those arising under state
or federal securities laws), in the name of Subscriber (or its nominee in
accordance with its delivery instructions) or to a custodian designated by
Subscriber, as applicable, and (ii) written notice from the Company or its
transfer agent evidencing the issuance to Subscriber of the Acquired Shares on
and as of the Closing Date. In the event the Closing does not occur on the
Closing Date, the Company shall promptly (but not later than one (1) business
day thereafter) return the Purchase Price to Subscriber.

 



 

b. The Closing shall be subject to the conditions that, on the Closing Date:

 



 

(i) no suspension of the qualification of the Acquired Shares for offering or
sale or trading in any jurisdiction, or initiation or threatening of any
proceedings for any of such purposes, shall have occurred;

 



 

(ii) all representations and warranties of the Company and Subscriber
contained in this Subscription Agreement shall be true and correct in all
material respects (other than representations and warranties that are
qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein),
which representations and warranties shall be true in all respects) at and as
of the Closing Date, and consummation of the Closing shall constitute a
reaffirmation by each of the Company and Subscriber of each of the
representations, warranties and agreements of each such party contained in
this Subscription Agreement as of the Closing Date, but in each case without
giving effect to consummation of the Transaction;

 



 

(iii) the Company shall have performed, satisfied and complied in all material
respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by this
Subscription Agreement to be performed, satisfied or complied with by it at or
prior to the Closing;

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) the Company shall have obtained approval of the NASDAQ to list the
Acquired Shares (other than the Series B Acquired Shares), subject to official
notice of issuance;

 



 

(v) the Company shall have filed the Certificate of Designation relating to
the Series B Preferred Stock with the State of Delaware;

 



 

(vi) no governmental authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any judgment, order, law, rule or regulation (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and has the
effect of making consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal
or otherwise restraining or prohibiting consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and no governmental authority shall have instituted or
threatened in writing a proceeding seeking to impose any such restraint or
prohibition;

 



 

(vii) the Company shall have received proceeds from debt or equity financings
on terms satisfactory to the Company that, together with the proceeds from the
sale of the Acquired Shares hereunder, will be sufficient for the Company to
pay the purchase price for the Transaction pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
and the Assignment on the Closing Date;

 



 

(viii) the Transaction shall be consummated substantially concurrently with
the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

c. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall execute and deliver such
additional documents and take such additional actions as the parties
reasonably may deem to be practical and necessary in order to consummate the
Subscription as contemplated by this Subscription Agreement.

 



 

3. _Company Representations and Warranties_. The Company represents and warrants that:

 



 

a. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, has been
duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation or limited
liability company in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
with corporate or limited liability company power and authority, as
applicable, to (i) own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its
business as presently conducted and (ii) with respect to the Company, to enter
into, deliver and perform its obligations under this Subscription Agreement.
The Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is
conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes
such qualification necessary, other than where the failure to be duly
incorporated, validly existing, or to so qualify or be in good standing has
not had and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

b. The Acquired Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and
delivered to Subscriber against full payment therefor in accordance with the
terms of this Subscription Agreement, the Acquired Shares will be validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not have been issued in
violation of or subject to any preemptive or similar rights created under the
Companys second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, under the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

 



      
 

 



 

c. The shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B
Preferred Stock (the " _Conversion Shares_ ") have been duly authorized and,
when issued and delivered to Subscriber against full payment therefor in
accordance with the terms thereof, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and will not have been issued in violation of or subject to any
preemptive or similar rights created under the Companys second amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, under the Delaware General Corporation
Law.

 



 

d. The Conversion Shares have been reserved for issuance upon conversion of
the Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

e. There are no securities or instruments issued by or to which the Company is
a party containing anti-dilution or similar provisions that will be triggered
by the issuance of (i) the Acquired Shares, or (ii) the shares to be issued
pursuant to any Other Subscription Agreement.

 



 

f. This Subscription Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company and is enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as may be limited or otherwise affected by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, and (ii)
principles of equity, whether considered at law or equity.

 



 

g. The execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement, the issuance and
sale of the Acquired Shares and the compliance by the Company with all of the
provisions of this Subscription Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not conflict with or result in a breach
or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company pursuant to the
terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease,
license or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is subject, which would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, properties, financial condition, stockholders
equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole (a " _Material Adverse Effect_ "), or materially affect the validity
of the Acquired Shares or the legal authority of the Company to comply in all
material respects with the terms of this Subscription Agreement; (ii) the
organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (iii)
any statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or
governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the
Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties that,
in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Acquired Shares or the
legal authority of the Company to comply in all material respects with this
Subscription Agreement.

 



 

h. The Company is not in default or violation (and no event has occurred
which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
violation) of any term, condition or provision of (i) the organizational
documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, permit,
franchise or license to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is now a

 



      
 

 



 

party or by which the Companys or any of its subsidiaries properties or
assets are bound or (iii) any statute or any judgment, order, rule or
regulation of any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign,
having jurisdiction over the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for
defaults or violations that have not had and would not be reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

i. The Company is not required to obtain any consent, waiver, authorization or
order of, give any notice to, or make any filing or registration with, any
court or other federal, state, local or other governmental authority, self-
regulatory organization (including Nasdaq) or other person in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Subscription
Agreement (including, without limitation, the issuance of the Acquired
Shares), other than (i) the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _Commission_ ") of the Registration Statement (as defined below), (ii)
filings required by applicable state securities laws, (iii) if applicable, the
filing of a Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities on Form D with the
Commission under Regulation D of the Securities Act, (iv) the filings required
in accordance with Section 8(m) of this Subscription Agreement; (v) those
required by NASDAQ, including with respect to obtaining the Stockholder
Approval (as defined below), and (vi) the failure of which to obtain would not
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

j. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 620,000,000 shares
of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (" _Common Stock_
"), including (x) 600,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and (y)
20,000,000 shares of Class C Common Stock (" _Class C Common Stock_"), and
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per

of Class A Common Stock, 19,155,921 shares of Class C Common Stock and one
share of Preferred Stock, designated as the "Series A Preferred Stock," were
issued and outstanding; (ii) 24,666,643 warrants, each entitling the holder

Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid
and are non-assessable and are not subject to preemptive rights and (ii)

the Company any Common Stock or other equity interests in the Company
(collectively, " _Equity Interests_ ") or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for Equity Interests.

 



 

k. The Company has made available to Subscriber (including via the
Commissions EDGAR system) a copy of each form, report, statement, schedule,
prospectus, proxy, registration statement and other document filed by the
Company with the Commission

 



       
 

 



 

since its initial registration of the Class A Common Stock (the " _SEC
Documents_ "). None of the SEC Documents filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), contained, when filed or, if
amended, as of the date of such amendment with respect to those disclosures
that are amended, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , that the Company makes no such representation or
warranty with respect to any information relating to Silverback or any of its
affiliates included in any SEC Document or filed as an exhibit thereto. The
Company has timely filed each report, statement, schedule, prospectus, and
registration statement that the Company was required to file with the
Commission since its inception. There are no material outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters from the Commission Staff with respect
to any of the SEC Documents.

 



 

l. The financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents
complied as to form in all material respects with Regulation S-X of the
Commission, were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X
of the Commission) and fairly present in all material respects in accordance
with applicable requirements of GAAP (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments) the financial position of
the Company as of their respective dates and the results of operations and the
cash flows of the Company for the periods presented therein.

 



 

m. The Company has not received any written communication since December 31,
2015 from a governmental entity that alleges that the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is not in compliance with or is in default or violation of any
applicable law, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

n. Except for such matters as have not had and would not be reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, there is
no (i) proceeding pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) judgment, decree,
injunction, ruling or order of any governmental entity or arbitrator
outstanding against the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

 



 

o. The lists of exhibits contained in the SEC Documents set forth a true and
complete list, as of the date of this Subscription Agreement, of each
agreement to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party (other
than the Agreement to Assign, this Subscription Agreement and the Other
Subscription Agreements) that is of a type that would be required to be
included as an exhibit to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 pursuant to
Items 601(b)(2), (4), (9) or (10) of Regulation S-K of the Commission if such
a registration statement were filed by the Company on the date of this
Subscription Agreement.

 



 

p. The issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock are registered
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and are listed for trading on
the NASDAQ under the symbol "CDEV". There is no suit, action, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company by NASDAQ or

 



      
 

 



 

the Commission with respect to any intention by such entity to deregister the
Class A Common Stock or prohibit or terminate the listing of the Class A
Common Stock on NASDAQ. The Company has taken no action that is designed to

4. _Subscriber Representations and Warranties_. Subscriber represents and warrants that:

generally, and (ii) principles of equity, whether considered at law or equity.

 



      
 

 



 

c. The execution, delivery and performance by Subscriber of this Subscription
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will
not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or
provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or

assets of Subscriber pursuant to the terms of (i) any indenture, mortgage,
deed of trust, loan agreement, lease, license or other agreement or instrument
to which Subscriber is a party or by which Subscriber is bound or to which any
of the property or assets of Subscriber is subject, which would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, properties,
financial condition, stockholders equity or results of operations of
Subscriber (a " _Subscriber Material Adverse Effect_ ") or materially affect
the legal authority of Subscriber to comply in all material respects with the
terms of this Subscription Agreement; (ii) the organizational documents of
Subscriber; or (iii) any statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of
any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, having
jurisdiction over Subscriber or any of its properties that, in the case of

Material Adverse Effect or affect the legal authority of Subscriber to comply
in all material respects with this Subscription Agreement.

 



 

d. Subscriber (i) is a "qualified institutional buyer" (as defined in Rule
144A under the Securities Act) or an institutional "accredited investor"
(within the meaning of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act) satisfying the
applicable requirements set forth on _Schedule A_ , (ii) is acquiring the
Acquired Shares only for its own account and not for the account of others, or
if Subscriber is subscribing for the Acquired Shares as a fiduciary or agent
for one or more investor accounts, each owner of such account is a qualified
institutional buyer and Subscriber has full investment discretion with respect
to each such account, and the full power and authority to make the
acknowledgements, representations and agreements herein on behalf of each
owner of each such account, and (iii) is not acquiring the Acquired Shares
with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution
thereof in violation of the Securities Act (and shall provide the requested

Shares.

 



 

e. Subscriber understands that the Acquired Shares are being offered in a
transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of the
Securities Act and that the Acquired Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act. Subscriber understands that the Acquired Shares may not be
resold, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of by Subscriber absent an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act, except (i) to the
Company or a subsidiary thereof, (ii) to non-U.S. persons pursuant to offers
and sales that occur outside the United States within the meaning of

exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and, in
each of cases (i) and (iii), in accordance with any applicable securities laws
of the states and other jurisdictions of the United States, and that any
certificates representing the Acquired Shares shall contain a legend to such
effect. Subscriber acknowledges that the Acquired Shares will not be eligible
for resale pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act.
Subscriber understands and agrees that the Acquired Shares will be subject to
transfer restrictions and, as a result of these transfer restrictions,
Subscriber may not be able to readily resell the Acquired Shares and may be
required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the Acquired Shares
for an indefinite period of time. Subscriber understands that it has been

 



      
 

 



 

advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or
transfer of any of the Acquired Shares.

 



 

f. Subscriber understands and agrees that Subscriber is purchasing the
Acquired Shares directly from the Company. Subscriber further acknowledges
that there have been no representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
made to Subscriber by the Company, Silverback or any of their respective
officers or directors, expressly or by implication, other than those
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company included
in this Subscription Agreement.

 



 

g. Subscriber represents and warrants that its acquisition and holding of the
Acquired Shares will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended, Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, or any applicable similar law.

 



 

h. In making its decision to purchase the Acquired Shares, Subscriber
represents that it has relied solely upon independent investigation made by
Subscriber. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Subscriber has received
such information as Subscriber deems necessary in order to make an investment
decision with respect to the Acquired Shares, including with respect to the
Company, Silverback and the Transaction. Subscriber represents and agrees that
Subscriber and Subscribers professional advisor(s), if any, have had the full
opportunity to ask such questions, receive such answers and obtain such
information as Subscriber and such undersigneds professional advisor(s), if
any, have deemed necessary to make an investment decision with respect to the
Acquired Shares.

 



 

i. Subscriber became aware of this offering of the Acquired Shares solely by
means of direct contact between Subscriber and the Company or by means of
contact from Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("Citi"), acting as placement agent
for the Company, and the Acquired Shares were offered to Subscriber solely by
direct contact between Subscriber and the Company or by contact between
Subscriber and Citi. Subscriber did not become aware of this offering of the
Acquired Shares, nor were the Acquired Shares offered to Subscriber, by any
other means. Subscriber acknowledges that the Company represents and warrants
that the Acquired Shares (i) were not offered by any form of general
solicitation or general advertising and (ii) are not being offered in a manner
involving a public offering under, or in a distribution in violation of, the
Securities Act, or any state securities laws.

 



 

j. Subscriber acknowledges that it is aware that there are substantial risks
incident to the purchase and ownership of the Acquired Shares. Subscriber has
such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Acquired
Shares, and Subscriber has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as
Subscriber has considered necessary to make an informed investment decision.

 



 

k. Subscriber represents and acknowledges that Subscriber has adequately
analyzed and fully considered the risks of an investment in the Acquired
Shares and determined that the Acquired Shares are a suitable investment for
Subscriber and that Subscriber is able at this time and in the foreseeable
future to bear the economic risk of a total loss of Subscribers

 



      
 

 



 

investment in the Company. Subscriber acknowledges specifically that a
possibility of total loss exists.

 



 

l. Subscriber understands and agrees that no federal or state agency has
passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Acquired Shares or
made any findings or determination as to the fairness of this investment.

 



 

m. Subscriber represents and warrants that Subscriber is not (i) a person or
entity named on the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons
administered by the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets
Control (" _OFAC_ ") or in any Executive Order issued by the President of the
United States and administered by OFAC (" _OFAC List_ "), or a person or
entity prohibited by any OFAC sanctions program, (ii) a Designated National as
defined in the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515, or (iii)
a non-U.S. shell bank or providing banking services indirectly to a non-U.S.
shell bank (collectively, a " _Prohibited Investor_ "). Subscriber agrees to
provide law enforcement agencies, if requested thereby, such records as
required by applicable law, provided that Subscriber is permitted to do so
under applicable law. Subscriber represents that if it is a financial
institution subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (31 U.S.C. Section 5311 et seq.)
(the " _BSA_ "), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the " _PATRIOT
Act_ "), and its implementing regulations (collectively, the " _BSA/PATRIOT
Act_ "), that Subscriber maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed
to comply with applicable obligations under the BSA/PATRIOT Act. Subscriber
also represents that, to the extent required, it maintains policies and
procedures reasonably designed for the screening of its investors against the
OFAC sanctions programs, including the OFAC List. Subscriber further
represents and warrants that, to the extent required, it maintains policies
and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the funds held by Subscriber
and used to purchase the Acquired Shares were legally derived.

 



 

5. _Registration Rights; Transfer_.

 



 

a. The Company agrees that, within seventy-five (75) calendar days after the
Closing, the Company will file with the Commission (at the Companys sole cost
and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of the Class A
Acquired Shares (the " _Registration Statement_ "), and the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no
later than the earlier of (i) the 90th calendar day following the filing
thereof and (ii) the 10th business day after the date the Company is notified
(orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the Commission that the
Registration Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not be subject to
further review (such earlier date, the " _Effectiveness Deadline_ ");
_provided, however_ , that the Companys obligations to include the Class A
Acquired Shares in the Registration Statement are contingent upon Subscriber
furnishing in writing to the Company such information regarding Subscriber,
the securities of the Company held by Subscriber and the intended method of
disposition of the Class A Acquired Shares as shall be reasonably requested by
the Company to effect the registration of the Class A Acquired Shares, and
shall execute such documents in connection with such registration as the
Company may reasonably request that are customary of a selling stockholder in
similar situations.

 



      
 

 



 

b. The Company shall, notwithstanding any termination of this Subscription
Agreement, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Subscriber (to the extent a
seller under the Registration Statement), the officers, directors, agents,
partners, members, managers, stockholders, affiliates, employees and
investment advisers of each of them, each person who controls Subscriber
(within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act) and the officers, directors, partners, members, managers,
stockholders, agents, affiliates, employees and investment advisers of each
such controlling person, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs
(including, without limitation, reasonable costs of preparation and
investigation and reasonable attorneys fees) and expenses (collectively, "
_Losses_ "), as incurred, that arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement, any prospectus included in the Registration Statement or any form
of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary
prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus or form of prospectus or
supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made)
not misleading, or (ii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of
the Securities Act, Exchange Act or any state securities law or any rule or
regulation thereunder, in connection with the performance of its obligations
under this Section 5, except to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
untrue statements, alleged untrue statements, omissions or alleged omissions
are based solely upon information regarding Subscriber furnished in writing to
the Company by Subscriber expressly for use therein. The Company shall notify
Subscriber promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any proceeding
arising from or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Section 5 of which the Company is aware. Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of an
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of the Class A Acquired
Shares by Subscriber.

 



 

c. Subscriber shall, severally and not jointly with any other subscriber,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, agents and
employees, each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the
directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling persons, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all Losses, as
incurred, arising out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any
prospectus included in the Registration Statement, or any form of prospectus,
or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or
arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
(in the case of any prospectus, or any form of prospectus or supplement
thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statements
or omissions are based solely upon information regarding Subscriber furnished
in writing to the Company by Subscriber expressly for use therein. In no event
shall the liability of Subscriber be greater in amount than the dollar amount
of the net proceeds received by Subscriber upon the sale of the Class A
Acquired Shares giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

 



      
 

 



 

d. Prior to the Special Meeting, Subscriber shall not sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of any Series B Acquired Shares without the prior
written consent of the Company, other than to affiliates of Subscriber.

 



 

6. _Additional Agreements_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) file, within seventy-five (75) calendar days following the Closing Date, a proxy statement for a special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") to be held to seek the approval, as required by the NASDAQ, of the issuance of the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock (the " _Stockholder Approval_ "), (b) mail a definitive proxy statement for such special meeting within ten (10) business days of the later of (i) the SEC notifying the Company that it will not review or has no further comment on such proxy statement and (ii) the SEC notifying the Company that it will not review or has no further comment on the Registration Statement, and (c) hold such special meeting within thirty (30) days of the mailing such definitive proxy statement.

 



 

7. _Termination_. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be void and of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of any party in respect thereof, upon the earlier to occur of (a) such date and time as the Purchase Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (b) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof by SB RS Holdings without the Assignment to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the Agreement to Assign, (c) upon the mutual written agreement of each of the parties hereto to terminate this Subscription Agreement, (d) if any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 2 of this Subscription Agreement are not satisfied on or prior to the Closing and, as a result thereof, the transactions contemplated by this Subscription Agreement are not consummated at the Closing or (e) January 31, 2017, if the Closing has not occurred by such date (subject to extension to a date no later than February 15, 2017 if the Purchase Agreement "Outside Date" (as defined therein) is correspondingly extended and the Company provides Subscriber notice of such extension or anticipated extension at least two (2) business days prior to January 31, 2017); _provided_ , that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof prior to the time of termination, and each party will be entitled to any remedies at law or in equity to recover losses, liabilities or damages arising from such breach. The Company shall notify Subscriber of the termination of the Purchase Agreement promptly after the termination of such agreement or the consummation of the transactions by SB RS Holdings without the Assignment to the Purchaser promptly after such consummation.

 



      
 

 



 

8. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

a. Subscriber acknowledges that the Company and others will rely on the
acknowledgments, understandings, agreements, representations and warranties
contained in this Subscription Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Subscriber
agrees to promptly notify the Company if any of the acknowledgments,
understandings, agreements, representations and warranties of Subscriber set
forth herein are no longer accurate in all material respects. The Company
acknowledges that Subscriber and others will rely on the acknowledgments,
understandings, agreements, representations and warranties contained in this
Subscription Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to promptly
notify Subscriber if any of the acknowledgments, understandings, agreements,
representations and warranties of the Company set forth herein are no longer
accurate in all material respects.

 



 

b. Each of the Company and Subscriber is entitled to rely upon this
Subscription Agreement and is irrevocably authorized to produce this
Subscription Agreement or a copy hereof to any interested party in any
administrative or legal proceeding or official inquiry with respect to the
matters covered hereby.

 



 

c. This Subscription Agreement and all of Subscribers rights and obligations
hereunder (including Subscribers obligation to purchase the Acquired Shares)
may be transferred or assigned, at any time and from time to time, to one or
more parties, in related or unrelated transactions (each such transferee, a "
_Transferee_ "). Upon any such assignment:

 



 

(i) the applicable Transferee shall enter into a subscription agreement (each
such subscription agreement, a " _New Subscription Agreement_ ") with the
Company to purchase that number of Subscribers Acquired Shares specified
therein (the " _Transferee Acquired Shares_ "), which New Subscription
Agreement shall be in substantially the same form as this Subscription
Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) upon a Transferees execution and delivery of a New Subscription
Agreement, the number of Acquired Shares to be purchased by Subscriber
hereunder shall be reduced by the total number of Transferee Acquired Shares
to be purchased by the applicable Transferee pursuant to the applicable New
Subscription Agreement, which reduction shall be evidenced by Subscriber and
the Company amending Schedule B to this Subscription Agreement to reflect each
transfer and to update the "Number of Acquired Shares subscribed for" and
"Aggregate Purchase Price" on the signature page hereto to reflect such
reduced number of Acquired Shares, and Subscriber shall be fully and
unconditionally released from its obligation to purchase such Transferee
Acquired Shares hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, this Subscription
Agreement need not be amended and restated in its entirety, but only Schedule
B and Subscribers signature page hereto need be so amended and updated and
executed by each of Subscriber and the Company upon the occurrence of any such
transfer of Transferee Acquired Shares.

 



 

d. All the agreements, representations and warranties made by each party
hereto in this Subscription Agreement shall survive the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

e. The Company may request from Subscriber such additional information as the
Company may deem necessary to evaluate the eligibility of Subscriber to
acquire the Acquired Shares, and Subscriber shall provide such information as
may be reasonably requested, to the extent readily available and to the extent
consistent with its internal policies and procedures.

 



 

f. This Subscription Agreement may not be modified, waived or terminated
except by an instrument in writing, signed by the party against whom
enforcement of such modification, waiver, or termination is sought.

 



 

g. This Subscription Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties, both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Subscription Agreement shall not confer any rights
or remedies upon any person other than (i) the parties hereto and their
respective successor and assigns and (ii) the persons entitled to
indemnification under Section 5.

 



 

h. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Subscription Agreement shall be
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs,
executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives, and permitted
assigns, and the agreements, representations, warranties, covenants and
acknowledgments contained herein shall be deemed to be made by, and be binding
upon, such heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives
and permitted assigns.

 



 

i. If any provision of this Subscription Agreement shall be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Subscription Agreement shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby and shall continue in full force and effect.

 



 

j. This Subscription Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by facsimile or electronic mail or in .pdf) and by different
parties in separate counterparts, with the same effect as if all parties
hereto had signed the same document. All counterparts so executed and
delivered shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

 



 

k. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Subscription Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Subscription Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Subscription Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

 



 

l. **THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE THE APPLICATION

A JURY TRIAL IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LITIGATION PURSUANT TO THIS SUBSCRIPTION

ANNEX A

 



 

 **Terms of Series B Preferred Stock**

 



 

Defined terms used in this Annex A shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in
the Subscription Agreement to which this Annex A is annexed.

 



    

Issuer

 |  

Centennial Resource Development, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 

---|--- 
   



 |  


 
   

Securities Offered

 |  

Shares of Series B Preferred Stock (including any Additional Acquired Shares
that are shares of Series B Preferred Stock) up to the maximum number of
Series B Acquired Shares subject to the Subscription Agreement, with a
liquidation preference of $0.0001 per share (the "Liquidation Preference"). 

   



 |  


 
   

Liquidation Preference

 |  

In the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Company (each a "Liquidation Event"), holders of the Series B
Preferred Stock will first be entitled to receive the Liquidation Preference
per share, to the date of payment before any distribution of assets is made to
holders of the Class A Common Stock or any other equity securities of the
Company that by their terms rank junior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to
liquidation rights.

 



 

If, in the event of a Liquidation Event, after payment of any amounts to be
paid in respect of any of the Companys equity securities that rank senior to
the Series B Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends or the
distribution of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company ("Senior Securities"), the Companys assets available for distribution
are insufficient to fully pay the liquidation payments owing to the holders of
the Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of any of the Companys equity
securities that rank on par with the Series B Preferred Stock as to the
payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company ("Parity Securities"), the holders of
the Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Securities will share ratably in
the distribution of the Companys assets in proportion to the full liquidating
distributions to which they would otherwise have been respectively entitled.

 



 

After the payment of the Liquidation Preference to the holders of the Series B
Preferred Stock (and payment of any amount to be paid in respect of any Senior
Securities and any Parity Securities), the remaining assets of the Company
shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the 

      
 

 



    



 |  

Companys common stock and the Series B Preferred Stock on a common equivalent
basis (and any other participating equity securities of the Company). 

---|--- 
   



 |  


 
   



 |  

For all purposes hereunder, the following events shall not constitute a
Liquidation Event (i) the merger or consolidation of the Company with any
other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of the
Series B Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or property for their
shares, the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the
Companys assets for cash, securities or other property, (ii) the conversion
of the Company into another legal entity, or (iii) sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company to an affiliate of the Company
in connection with a reorganization or liquidation. 

   



 |  


 
   

Conversion

 |  

Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into 250
shares of Class A Common Stock, subject to adjustments for stock splits, stock
dividends, reorganization, recapitalizations and the like, upon the receipt by
the Company of the Stockholder Approval. 

   



 |  


 
   

Voting Rights

 |  

The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights,
except as set forth below or as required by law. The affirmative vote of
holders of a majority of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting
as a separate class, is required to (a) approve any amendment, alteration or
repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Designation relating to the
Series B Preferred Stock or the Companys charter that adversely affects the
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series B Preferred
Stock or (b) authorize the issuance of any Senior Securities or Parity
Securities. With respect to any matter on which the holders of Series B
Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, each share of Series B Preferred Stock
will be entitled to one vote on such matter. 

   



 |  


 
   

Dividends

 |  

No dividends shall be payable on the Series B Preferred Stock; _provided_ ,
that holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to pro rata
participation in any dividends paid on the Companys common stock, on a common
equivalent basis. 

   



 |  


 
   

No Maturity Date

 |  

The Series B Preferred Stock is perpetual unless, as described below, redeemed
by the Company at its option. 

   



 |  


 
   

Redemption at the Companys Option

 |  

Beginning on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company will have
the right, but not the obligation, to redeem all (but not less than all) of
each holders shares of Series B Preferred Stock for a redemption price per
share, determined on an as converted basis, equal to the average of 

 



      
 

 



    



 |  

the last reported sale price for a share of Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ for
each of the last 10 consecutive trading days prior to the redemption date or,
if such shares are no longer traded, at the fair market value of the Class A
Common Stock, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Company. 

---|---

Use of Proceeds

 |  

Proceeds of the offering will be used to pay a portion of the purchase price
for the Transaction
