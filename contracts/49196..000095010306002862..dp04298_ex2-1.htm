 AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 20, 2006 (this " _Agreement_ "),  by and among HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED, a Maryland corporation (" _Huntington_ "),  PENGUIN ACQUISITION, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and wholly owned  subsidiary of Huntington that is disregarded as an entity separate from Huntington  under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701 -3 (" _Merger  Sub_ ") and SKY FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.,  an Ohio corporation (" _Sky_ ").

     W I T N E S S E T H:  
--- 
  

 WHEREAS,  the Boards of Directors of Sky and Huntington, and the managing member of Merger  Sub, have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies  and their shareholders and stockholders and sole member, respectively, to consummate  the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement  in which Sky will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this  Agreement, merge with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "),  so that Merger Sub is the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes referred  to in such capacity as the " _Surviving  Company_ "); and

 

 WHEREAS,  for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify  as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1986, as amended (the  " _Code_ "),  and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for  purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

 

 WHEREAS,  the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements  in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the  Merger.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements  contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt  and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally  bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

     ARTICLE I 
  
  THE MERGER  
--- 
  

 1.1 _The  Merger_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions  of this Agreement, in accordance with the Ohio General Corporation Law (the  " _OGCL_ ")  and the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (the " _MLLCA_ "),  at the Effective Time, Sky shall merge with and into Merger Sub. Merger Sub shall  be the Surviving Company in the Merger, and shall continue its limited liability  company existence under the laws of the State of Maryland. As of the Effective  Time, the separate corporate existence of Sky shall cease.

 

 (b) Huntington  and Merger Sub may at any time change the method of effecting the combination  (including by providing for the merger of Sky directly into Huntington, with  Huntington surviving the merger), and Sky shall cooperate in such efforts, 

 

1    
  
 

including by entering into an appropriate  amendment to this Agreement (to
the extent such amendment only changes the method  of effecting the business
combination and does not substantively affect this  Agreement or the rights
and obligations of the parties or their respective shareholders  or
stockholders, as applicable, hereunder); _provided_ , _however_ ,  that no
such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger 
Consideration (as defined in _Section_ _1.4(a)_ )  provided for in this
Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Skys  shareholders as
a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment  of
either party pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) materially impede or delay 
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 1.2 _Effective  Time_. The Merger shall become effective  as set forth in the articles of merger (the " _Articles  of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with  the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (" _SDAT")_ and  the certificate of merger (the  " _Certificate of Merger_ ")  that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio on or before  the Closing Date. The term " _Effective  Time_ " shall be the date and time when  the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger and the Certificate  of Merger. " _Effective Date_ " shall mean the date on which the Effective Time occurs.

 

 1.3 _Effects  of the Merger_. At and after the Effective  Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 1701.82 of the  OGCL and Section 4A-709 of the MLLCA.

 

 1.4 _Conversion  of Sky Capital Stock_. At the Effective  Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Huntington,  Merger Sub, Sky or the holder of any of the following securities:

 

 (a) Subject  to _Section 2.2(e)_ ,  each share of the common stock, without par value, of Sky issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Sky  Common_ _Stock_ "),  except for shares of Sky Common Stock owned by Huntington, Merger Sub or Sky  (other than shares of Sky Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts  and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially  owned by third parties (any such shares, " _Trust  Account Common Shares_ ") and other than  shares of Sky Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Huntington, Merger  Sub or Sky in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares, " _DPC Common Shares_ ")) and for  Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section  1.10_ ), shall be converted into the right  to receive (i) 1.098 shares (the " _Stock_ _Consideration_ ")  of common stock, without par value, of Huntington (" _Huntington Common_ _Stock_ ")  and (ii) an amount in cash equal to $3.023, without interest (the " _Cash  Consideration_ "). The Cash Consideration  and the Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to collectively herein as  the " _Merger Consideration_."

 

 (b) All  of the shares of Sky Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger  Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall  no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease  to exist as of the Effective Time, and, subject to _Section  1.10_ , each certificate previously representing  any such shares of Sky Common Stock (each a " _Certificate_ ")  shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration  and (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Sky Common  Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this _Section  1.4_ and _Section  2.2(e)_ , as well as any dividends or distributions to which holders of Sky  Common Stock 

 

2    
  
 

are entitled in accordance with _Section  2.2(b)_. If, prior to the Effective
Time,  the outstanding shares of Huntington Common Stock or Sky Common Stock
shall  have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number  or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization,  reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other  similar change in capitalization, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment  shall be made to the Merger
Consideration.

 

 (c) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares  of Sky Common Stock that are owned by Sky, Huntington or Merger Sub (other than  Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares) shall be cancelled and shall  cease to exist and no stock of Huntington or Merger Sub or other consideration  shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Huntington shall deposit,  or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company Subsidiary of  Huntington, or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to each  of Sky and Huntington (the " _Exchange  Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange  in accordance with this _Article II_ ,  (i) certificates representing the shares of Huntington Common Stock sufficient  to deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration, (ii) immediately available funds  equal to any dividends or distributions payable in accordance with _Section  2.2(b)_ , (iii) immediately available funds  equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration and (iv) cash in lieu of any fractional  shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Huntington Common Stock, collectively  being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued  pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and  paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Sky Common Stock (other than  Dissenting Shares).

 

 2.2 _Exchange  of Shares_. (a) As soon as practicable  after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record  of one or more Certificates (except to the extent representing Dissenting Shares)  a letter of transmittal in customary form as prepared by Huntington and reasonably  acceptable to Sky (which shall specify, among other things, that delivery shall  be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only  upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for  use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger  Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares  of Sky Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have  been converted pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions  to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section  2.2(b)_. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate  or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together  with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder  of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange  therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing the number of whole  shares of Huntington Common Stock to which such holder of Sky Common Stock  shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article  I_ , (ii) a check representing the amount  of the aggregate Cash Consideration (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)  and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to  receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant  to the provisions of this _Article II_ ,  and (iii) a check representing the amount of any dividends or distributions  then payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(i)_ ,  and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares  or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates.  Until so surrendered, each Certificate shall represent after the Effective  Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, together  with any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions  as contemplated by _Section 2.2(b)_.

 

6    
  
 

 (b) No dividends  or other distributions declared with respect to Huntington Common Stock shall  be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof  shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this _Article  II_. After the surrender of a Certificate  in accordance with this _Article II_ ,  the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (i) the amount of any  dividends or distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which  have been declared by Sky in respect of the shares of Sky Common Stock after  the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and  which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, (ii) the amount of dividends or other  distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid, without  any interest thereon, with respect to the whole shares of Huntington Common Stock  represented by such Certificate, and (iii), at the appropriate payment date,  the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective  Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender, with  respect to shares of Huntington Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

 

 (c) If any  certificate representing shares of Huntington Common Stock is to be issued in,  or any cash is paid to, a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates  surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition  to the issuance or payment thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered  shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)  and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such  exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes  required by reason of the payment or issuance in any name other than that of  the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required  for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange  Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

 (d) After  the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of  Sky of the shares of Sky Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Sky Common Stock  that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates  representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they  shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in  this _Article II_.

 

 (e) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip  representing fractional shares of Huntington Common Stock shall be issued upon  the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with  respect to Huntington Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any  fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner  thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Huntington. In lieu  of the issuance of any such fractional share, Huntington shall pay to each former  shareholder of Sky who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional  share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying  (i) Huntington Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the  nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Huntington Common Stock  to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section  1.4_.

 

 (f) Any  portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Sky  as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be paid to Huntington.  Any former shareholders of Sky who have not theretofore complied with this _Article  II_ shall 

 

7    
  
 

thereafter look only to Huntington for  payment of the Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares and  any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable in accordance with _Section  2.2(b)_ in respect of each
share of Sky Common  Stock, as the case may be, such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this  Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  none of Huntington, Merger Sub, Sky,
the Exchange Agent or any other person shall  be liable to any former holder
of shares of Sky Common Stock for any amount delivered  in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,  escheat or
similar laws.

 

 (g) In the  event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making  of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Huntington, the posting by  such person of a bond in such amount as Huntington may determine is reasonably  necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect  to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,  stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu  of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 2.3 _Withholding  Rights_. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent  to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Huntington) shall be entitled  to deduct and withhold from any cash portion of the Merger Consideration, any  cash in lieu of fractional shares of Huntington Common Stock, cash dividends  or distributions payable pursuant to _Section  2.2(b)_ hereof and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this  Agreement to any holder of Sky Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent  or Huntington, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under  the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect  to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by  the Exchange Agent or Huntington, as the case may be, such withheld amounts  shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to  the holder of shares of Sky Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction  and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Huntington, as the case may  be.

Each Sky Plan has  been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. There  is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected  to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to  a Sky Plan or the imposition of any material lien on the assets of Sky or any  of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. _Section  3.11(d)_ of the Sky Disclosure Schedule identifies  each Sky Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the  meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Sky  Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued  a favorable determination letter with respect to each Sky Qualified Plan and  the related trust that has not been revoked or Sky is entitled to rely on a favorable  opinion issued by the IRS, and, to the knowledge of Sky, there are no existing  circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to  adversely affect the qualified status of any Sky Qualified Plan or the related  trust. No trust funding any Sky Plan is intended to meet the requirements of  Code Section 501(c)(9). None of Sky and its Subsidiaries nor any other person,  including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as  defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which would reasonably  be expected to subject any of the Sky Plans or their related trusts, Sky, any  of its Subsidiaries or any person that Sky or any of its Subsidiaries has an  obligation to indemnify, to any material Tax or penalty imposed under Section  4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 

 (e) With  respect to each Sky Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA  or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) there does not exist any accumulated  funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302  of ERISA, whether or not waived, and, (ii) except as would not have, individually  or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (A) the fair market value of  the assets of such Sky Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of  all accrued benefits under such Sky Plan (whether or not vested) on a termination  basis; (B) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA  for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred; (C)  all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ")  have been timely paid in full; (D) no liability (other than for premiums to the  PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or would reasonably be expected to be  incurred by Sky or any of its Subsidiaries; and (E) the PBGC has not instituted  proceedings to terminate any such Sky Plan and, to Skys knowledge, no condition  exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which  would reasonably be expected to constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA  for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such  Sky Plan.

 

 (f) (i)  No Sky Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or more contributing  sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning  of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple  Employer Plan_ "); (ii) none of Sky and  its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time  during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to  any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of Sky and its  Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred, during  the last six years, any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full.  There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably  be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability  of Sky or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such  liabilities that arise solely out of, 

 

17    
  
 

or relate solely to, the Sky Benefit Plans.  Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, neither Sky nor any of its  Subsidiaries, nor, to Skys
knowledge, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates,  has engaged in any
transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212  of ERISA.

 

 (g) Sky  and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical or other welfare  benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for  health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part  6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to Sky and its Subsidiaries.

 

 (h) Neither  the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in conjunction  with any other event (whether contingent or otherwise), (i) result in any payment  or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director,  employee or independent contractor of the Sky or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)  increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable  or required to be provided to any such director, employee or independent contractor,  (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of  any such benefit or compensation or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible  by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

 

 (i) No labor  organization or group of employees of Sky or any of its Subsidiaries has made  a pending demand for recognition or certification, and there are no representation  or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding  presently pending or, to Skys knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed,  with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal  or authority. Each of Sky and its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with  all applicable laws and collective bargaining agreements respecting employment  and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours  and occupational safety and health.

Since January 1, 2004, as of their respective dates,  all Sky Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied  as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations  of the SEC with respect thereto.

 

 3.13 _Compliance  with Applicable Law_.

Intercept and Obstruct Terrorist (USA Patriot) Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy

failure  to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such
noncompliance  or default is not reasonably likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate,  a Material Adverse Effect on Sky.

 

 (b) Except  as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,  a Material Adverse Effect on Sky, Sky and each Sky Subsidiary have properly administered  all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it  serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator  or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents,  applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. None of Sky,  any Sky Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of Sky or of any Sky  Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect  to any such fiduciary account that is reasonably likely to have, either individually  or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sky, and, except as would not  be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material  Adverse Effect on Sky, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are  true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

 

 (c) Since  the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Sky has been in compliance in all material  respects with (i) applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the  applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq.

 (b) Each  Sky Material Contract is valid and binding on Sky (or, to the extent a Subsidiary  of Sky is a party, such Subsidiary) and, to the knowledge of Sky, any other party  thereto and is in full force and effect. Neither Sky nor any of its Subsidiaries  is in breach or default under any Sky Material Contract except where any such  breach or default would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be  expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Sky and its Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole. Neither Sky nor any Subsidiary of Sky knows of, or has received  notice of, any violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of Sky, does  there exist any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice  or both would result in such a violation or default under) any Sky Material Contract  by any other party thereto except where any such violation or default would not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material  Adverse Effect on Sky and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Prior to the date  hereof, Sky has made available to Huntington true and complete copies of all  Sky Material Contracts.

respect the conduct of its business or that in any  material manner relates
to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends,  its credit or risk
management policies, its management or its business, other  than those of
general application that apply to similarly situated financial  holding
companies or their Subsidiaries (each item in this sentence, whether  or not
set forth in the Sky Disclosure Schedule, a " _Sky  Regulatory Agreement_ "),
nor has Sky  or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2004 by
any Regulatory  Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering
issuing, initiating,  ordering, or requesting any such Sky Regulatory
Agreement. Each depository institution  Subsidiary (" _Bank Subsidiary_ ") 
of Sky is, and to the knowledge of Sky, there has not been any event or
occurrence  since January 1, 2004 that could reasonably be expected to result
in a determination  that any such Bank Subsidiary is not "well capitalized"
and "well  managed" as a matter of U.S. federal banking law. Each Bank
Subsidiary of  Sky has at least a "satisfactory" rating under the U.S.
Community Reinvestment  Act.

 

 3.16 _Derivative  Transactions_. Except as would not be reasonably  likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse  Effect on Sky, (i) all Derivative Transactions, whether entered into for the  account of Sky or for the account of a customer of Sky or any of its Subsidiaries,  were entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice  and in accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations  and policies of any Regulatory Authority and other policies, practices and  procedures employed by Sky and its Subsidiaries and with counterparties believed  to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding  obligations of Sky or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in accordance  with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,  reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally  and the availability of equitable remedies), and are in full force and effect,  (ii) Sky and its Subsidiaries have duly performed their obligations thereunder  to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and, (iii) to  Skys knowledge, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations  or assertions of such by any party thereunder. A " _Derivative  Transaction_ " means any swap transaction, option, warrant, forward purchase  or sale transaction, futures transaction, cap transaction, floor transaction  or collar transaction relating to one or more currencies, commodities, bonds,  equity securities, loans, interest rates, prices, values, or other financial  or non-financial assets, credit-related events or conditions or any indexes,  or any other similar transaction or combination of any of these transactions,  including collateralized mortgage obligations or other similar instruments  or any debt or equity instruments evidencing or embedding any such types of  transactions, and any related credit support, collateral or other similar arrangements  related to such transactions.

 

 3.17 _Undisclosed  Liabilities_. Except for (i) those liabilities  that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of  Sky included in the Sky 10-Q (including any notes thereto) (ii) liabilities  incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated  hereby and (iii)for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business  consistent with past practice since September 30, 2006, since such date, neither  Sky nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever  (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become  due) that has had or is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in  the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sky.

 

21    
  
 

 3.18 _Environmental  Liability_. There are no legal, administrative,  arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental  investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of  any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in the  imposition, on Sky of any liability or obligation arising under common law  or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance  including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability  Act of 1980, as amended, pending or threatened against Sky, which liability  or obligation is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,  a Material Adverse Effect on Sky. To the knowledge of Sky, there is no reasonable  basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation  that would impose any liability or obligation that would be reasonably likely  to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sky.  Sky is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum  by or with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability or  obligation with respect to the foregoing that is reasonably likely to have,  either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sky.

 

 3.19 _Real  Property_.

 

 (a) Each  of Sky and its Subsidiaries has good title free and clear of all Liens to all  real property owned by such entities (the " _Owned  Properties_ "), except for Liens that do not materially detract from the present  use of such real property.

 

 (b) A true  and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which Sky or any of its Subsidiaries  leases any real property (such agreements, together with any amendments, modifications  and other supplements thereto, collectively, the " _Leases_ ")  has heretofore been made available to Huntington. Each Lease is valid, binding  and enforceable against Sky or its applicable Subsidiary in accordance with its  terms and is in full force and effect (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of  creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies). There are no  defaults by Sky or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, under any of the Leases  which, in the aggregate, would result in the termination of such Leases and a  Material Adverse Effect on Sky. The consummation of the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement will not cause defaults under the Leases, except for any such  default which would not individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse  Effect on Sky and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 

 (c) The  Owned Properties and the properties (the " _Leased  Properties_ ") leased pursuant to the  Leases constitute all of the real estate on which Sky and its Subsidiaries maintain  their facilities or conduct their business as of the date of this Agreement,  except for locations the loss of which would not result in a Material Adverse  Effect on Sky and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 

 (d) A true  and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which Sky or any of its Subsidiaries  leases real property to a third party (such agreements, together with any amendments,  modifications and other supplements thereto, collectively, the " _Third  Party_ _Leases_ ")  has heretofore been made available to Huntington. Each Third Party Lease is valid,  binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms and is in full force and  effect (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization  or similar laws affecting 

 

22    
  
 

the rights of creditors generally and  the availability of equitable
remedies). There are no existing defaults by the  tenant under any Third
Party Lease which, in the aggregate, would result in the  termination of such
Third Party Leases except for any such default which would  not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Sky and  its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

 

 3.20 _State  Takeover Laws_. The Board of Directors  of Sky has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby  as required to render inapplicable to such agreements and transactions the  provisions of Chapter 1704 and Section 1707.043 of the OGCL and all other similar "takeover" or "interested  shareholder" law. Sky has taken all action necessary so that the entering  into of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated  hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any person  under the Sky Shareholder Rights Agreement or enable or require the rights  issuable thereunder to be exercised, distributed or triggered.

 

 3.21 _Reorganization_.  As of the date of this Agreement, Sky is not aware of any fact or circumstance  that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within  the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

 

 3.22 _Opinion_.  Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Sky has received an opinion from Sandler  ONeill and Partners, L.P. to the effect that as of the date thereof and  based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration  is fair to the shareholders of Sky from a financial point of view. Such opinion  has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

 

 3.23 _Internal  Controls_. (a) None of Sky or its Subsidiaries records,  systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated  or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including  any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or  not) which (including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under  the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or its Subsidiaries or accountants  except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected  to result in a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting  controls described in the next sentence. Sky and its Subsidiaries have devised  and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide  reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and  the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance  with GAAP.

 

 (b) Sky  (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating  to Sky including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer  and the chief financial officer of Sky by others within those entities, and (y)  has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof,  to Skys outside auditors and the audit committee of Skys Board of  Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design  or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule  13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect  Skys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information,  and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other  employees who have a significant role in Skys internal controls over financial  reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Skys 

 

23    
  
 

auditors and audit committee and a copy  has previously been made available
to Huntington. As of the date hereof, there  is no reason to believe that its
outside auditors and its chief executive officer  and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations  required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404  of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley  Act_ "), without
qualification, when next due.

 

 (c) Since  December 31, 2005, (i) through the date hereof, neither Sky nor any of its Subsidiaries  has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,  allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting  or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Sky or any of  its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including  any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Sky or any of its  Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and  (ii) no attorney representing Sky or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not  employed by Sky or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material  violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by  Sky or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors  of Sky or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Sky.

 

 3.24 _Insurance_.  Sky and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers against such risks  and in such amounts as its management reasonably has determined to be prudent  in accordance with industry practices.

 

 3.25 _Sky  Information_. The information relating  to Sky and its Subsidiaries contained in the Joint Proxy Statement and the  Form S-4, or that is provided by Sky or its representatives for inclusion in  any other document filed with any other Regulatory Agency in connection with  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to  make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are  made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement (except for such portions thereof  that relate only to Huntington, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries) will  comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and  the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

 3.26 _Investment  Securities_. Except where failure to be  true would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on  Sky, (a) each of Sky and its Subsidiaries has good title to all securities  owned by it (except those sold under repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary  or agency capacity), free and clear of any Liens, except to the extent such  securities are pledged in the ordinary course of business to secure obligations  of Sky or its Subsidiaries, and such securities are valued on the books of  Sky in accordance with GAAP in all material respects, and (b) Sky and its Subsidiaries  and their respective businesses employ investment, securities, commodities,  risk management and other policies, practices and procedures which Sky believes  are prudent and reasonable in the context of such businesses.

 

 3.27 _Loan  Portfolio_. (a) _Section  3.27_ of the Sky Disclosure Schedule sets  forth (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount, as of November 30, 2006,  of all loan agreements, notes or borrowing arrangements (including leases and  credit enhancements) payable to Sky or its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Loans_ "), other than "non-accrual" Loans,  and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount, as of November 30, 2006,  of all "non-accrual" 

 

24    
  
 

Loans. As of November 30, 2006, Sky and  its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
did not have outstanding Loans and assets  classified as "Other Real Estate
Owned" with an aggregate then outstanding,  fully committed principal amount

Schedule.

 

 (b) Each  Loan (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness  which are true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured,  has been secured by valid liens and security interests which have been perfected  and (iii) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein,  enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of  creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity). All Loans originated  by Sky or its Subsidiaries, and all such Loans purchased, administered or serviced  by Sky or its Subsidiaries, were made or purchased and/or are administered or  serviced, as applicable, in accordance with customary lending standards of Sky  or its Subsidiaries, as applicable. All such Loans (and any related guarantees)  and payments due thereunder are, and on the Effective Date will be, free and  clear of any Lien, and Sky or its Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects,  and on the Effective Date will have complied in all material respects, with all  laws and regulations relating to such Loans.

 

 (c) None  of the agreements pursuant to which Sky or any of its Subsidiaries has sold Loans  or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans contains any obligation  to repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely on account of a payment  default by the obligor on any such Loan. 

 

 (d) Each  of Sky and each Sky Subsidiary, as applicable, is approved by and is in good  standing as a seller/servicer by the Federal National Mortgage Association and  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to originate and service conventional  residential mortgage Loans (each such entity being referred to herein as an " _Agency_ " and,  collectively, the " _Agencies_ ").

 

 (e) None  of Sky or any of its Subsidiaries is now nor has it ever been since January 1,  2004 subject to any fine, suspension, settlement or other agreement or other  administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction in any loan purchase  commitment from any Agency or any federal or state agency relating to the origination,  sale or servicing of mortgage or consumer Loans. Neither Sky nor any of its Subsidiaries  has received any notice that any Agency proposes to limit or terminate the underwriting  authority of Sky or any of its Subsidiaries or to increase the guarantee fees  payable to any such Agency. 

 

 (f) Each  of Sky and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with all  applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, including the  Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation  B, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, the Fair Credit  Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all Agency and other  investor and mortgage insurance company requirements relating to the origination,  sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer Loans.

25    
  
 

conduct of its business as currently conducted  that is material to Sky and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as would  not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sky, (i) the  use of any
Intellectual Property by Sky and its Subsidiaries does not, to the  knowledge
of Sky, infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any person and  is in
accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which Sky or any
Subsidiary  acquired the right to use any Intellectual Property; (ii) no
person is challenging,  infringing on or otherwise violating any right of Sky
or any of its Subsidiaries  with respect to any Intellectual Property owned

and no Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed  by Sky or its

abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such Intellectual Property.

There are no material disputes, audits, examinations  or proceedings pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon Huntington  or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 4.11 _Employee  Benefits_. For purposes hereof, the following  terms shall have the following meaning:

 

 A " _Huntington  Benefit Plan_ " means any material  employee benefit plan, program, policy, practice, or other arrangement providing  benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of Huntington  or any of its Subsidiaries or any beneficiary or dependent thereof that is  sponsored or maintained by Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries or to which  Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries contributes or is obligated to contribute,  whether or not written, including without limitation any employee welfare benefit  plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, any employee pension benefit  plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such plan  is subject to ERISA) and any bonus, incentive, deferred 

 

31    
  
 

compensation, vacation, stock purchase,  stock option, severance, employment,
change of control or fringe benefit plan,  program or policy.

 

 " _Huntington  Employment Agreement_ " means a contract,  offer letter or agreement of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries with or  addressed to any individual who is rendering or has rendered services thereto  as an employee or consultant pursuant to which Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries  has any actual or contingent liability or obligation to provide compensation  and/or benefits in consideration for past, present or future services.

 

 " _Huntington  Plan_ " means any Huntington Benefit  Plan other than a Multiemployer Plan.

 

 (a) _Section  4.11(a)_ of the Huntington Disclosure Schedule  includes a complete list of all material Huntington Benefit Plans and all material  Huntington Employment Agreements.

 

 (b) With  respect to each Huntington Plan, Huntington has delivered or made available to  Sky a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing constituting a part  of such Huntington Plan, including without limitation all plan documents, employee  communications, benefit schedules, trust agreements, and insurance contracts  and other funding vehicles; (ii) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series)  and accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) the current summary plan description  and any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case, whether or not  required to be furnished under ERISA); (iv) the most recent annual financial  report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (vi) the most  recent determination letter from the IRS, if any. Huntington has delivered or  made available to Sky a true, correct and complete copy of each material Huntington  Employment Agreement.

 

 (c) All  material contributions required to be made to any Huntington Plan by applicable  law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and  all material premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding  any Huntington Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been timely  made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or  before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the financial statements  to the extent required by GAAP. Each Huntington Benefit Plan that is an employee  welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (i) is funded through  an insurance company contract and is not a  "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code  or (ii) is unfunded.

 

 (d) With  respect to each Huntington Plan, Huntington and its Subsidiaries have complied,  and are now in compliance, in all material respects, with all provisions of ERISA,  the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to such Huntington Plans. Each  Huntington Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance  with its terms. There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably  be expected to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with  respect to a Huntington Plan or the imposition of any material lien on the assets  of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. _Section  4.11(d)_ of the Huntington Disclosure Schedule  identifies each Huntington Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within  the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Huntington Qualified Plans_ ").  The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter 

 

32    
  
 

with respect to each Qualified Plan and  the related trust that has not been
revoked or Huntington is entitled to rely  on a favorable opinion issued by
the IRS, and, to the knowledge of Huntington,  there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably  be expected
to adversely affect the qualified status of any Huntington Qualified  Plan or
the related trust. No trust funding any Huntington Plan is intended to  meet
the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9). None of Huntington and its
Subsidiaries  nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in
any "prohibited  transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA),  which would reasonably be expected to subject any of
the Huntington Plans or  their related trusts, Huntington, any of its
Subsidiaries or any person that  Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries has an
obligation to indemnify, to any  material Tax or penalty imposed under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502  of ERISA.

 

 (e) With  respect to each Huntington Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of  ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) there does not exist any accumulated  funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302  of ERISA, whether or not waived, and, (ii) except as would not have, individually  or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (A) the fair market value of  the assets of such Huntington Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value  of all accrued benefits under such Huntington Plan (whether or not vested) on  a termination basis; (B) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c)  of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred;  (C) all premiums to the PBGC have been timely paid in full; (D) no liability  (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or would  reasonably be expected to be incurred by Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries;  and (E) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Huntington  Plan and, to Huntingtons knowledge, no condition exists that presents a  risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which would reasonably be expected  to constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or  the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Huntington Plan.

 

 (f) (i)  No Huntington Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or  more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,  within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA; (ii) none of Huntington and its  Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during  the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer  Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of Huntington and its Subsidiaries  nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred, during the last six  years, any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. There does  not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected  to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Huntington  or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities  that arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the Huntington Benefit Plans.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Huntington nor any  of its Subsidiaries, nor, to Huntingtons knowledge, any of their respective  ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or  Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

 

 (g) Huntington  and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical or other welfare  benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for  health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part  6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to Huntington and its Subsidiaries.

 

33    
  
 

 (h) Neither  the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in conjunction  with any other event (whether contingent or otherwise), (i) result in any payment  or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director,  employee or independent contractor of the Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries,  (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable  or required to be provided to any such director, employee or independent contractor,  (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of  any such benefit or compensation or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible  by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

 

 (i) No labor  organization or group of employees of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries has  made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and there are no representation  or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding  presently pending or, to Huntingtons knowledge, threatened to be brought  or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations  tribunal or authority. Each of Huntington and its Subsidiaries is in material  compliance with all applicable laws and collective bargaining agreements respecting  employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages  and hours and occupational safety and health.

 

 4.12 _SEC  Reports_. Huntington has previously made  available to Sky an accurate and complete copy of each (i) final registration  statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive Proxy Statement filed  since January 1, 2004 by Huntington with the SEC pursuant to the Securities  Act or the Exchange Act (the " _Huntington  Reports_ ") and prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) communication  mailed by Huntington to its stockholders since January 1, 2004 and prior to  the date of this Agreement, and no such Huntington Report or communication,  as of the date of such Huntington Report or communication, contained any untrue  statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required  to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,  in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except  that information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)  shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since January  1, 2004, as of their respective dates, all Huntington Reports filed under the  Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects  with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

 

 4.13 _Compliance  with Applicable Law_. (a) Huntington and  each of its Subsidiaries hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations  necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant  to each, and have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any  respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy  or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to Huntington or any of its  Subsidiaries (including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing  Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the  Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to  Intercept and Obstruct Terrorist (USA Patriot) Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy  Act and applicable limits on loans to one borrower), except where the failure  to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance  or default is not reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate,  have a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington.

 

34    
  
 

 (b) Except  as is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,  a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington, Huntington and each Huntington Subsidiary  have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including  accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative,  guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of  the governing documents, applicable state and federal law and regulation and  common law. None of Huntington, any Huntington Subsidiary, or any director, officer  or employee of Huntington or of any Huntington Subsidiary, has committed any  breach of trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account  that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect on Huntington, and, except as would not be reasonably  likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect  on Huntington and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and  correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

 

 (c) Since  the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Huntington has been in compliance in  all material respects with (i) applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations  of the Nasdaq.

 

 4.14 _Certain  Contracts_. (a) Except as set forth in  the exhibit index for Huntingtons Annual Report on Form 10-K for the  year ended December 31, 2005 or as permitted pursuant to _Section  5.3_ hereof or as set forth on _Section  4.14_ of Huntington Disclosure Schedule,  neither Huntington nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i)  any Instruments of Indebtedness by Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries in  an amount in excess in the aggregate of $50,000,000, other than those having  a term of 30 days or less and other than deposit liabilities (collectively, " _Huntington  Instruments of Indebtedness_ "), (ii)  any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10)  of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) any non-competition or exclusive dealing  agreement, or any other agreement or obligation which purports to limit or  restrict in any material respect (A) the ability of Huntington or its Subsidiaries  to solicit customers or (B) the manner in which, or the localities in which,  all or any portion of the business of Huntington and its Subsidiaries or, following  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Sky and its  Subsidiaries, is or would be conducted, (iv) any contract or agreement providing  for any payments that are conditioned, in whole or in part, on a change of  control of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) any collective bargaining  agreement, and (vi) any contract or other agreement not made in the ordinary  course of business which (A) is material to Huntington and its Subsidiaries  taken as a whole or (B) which would reasonably be expected to materially delay  the consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (the agreements, contracts and obligations of the type described  in clauses (i) through (vi) being referred to herein as " _Huntington  Material_ _Contracts_ ").  There are no provisions in any Huntington Instrument of Indebtedness that provide  any restrictions on the repayment of the outstanding Indebtedness thereunder,  or that require that any financial payment (other than payment of outstanding  principal and accrued interest) be made in the event of the repayment of the  outstanding Indebtedness thereunder prior to expiration.

 

 (b) Each  Huntington Material Contract is valid and binding on Huntington (or, to the extent  a Subsidiary of Huntington is a party, such Subsidiary) and, to the knowledge  of Huntington, any other party thereto and is in full force and effect. Neither  Huntington nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default under any Huntington  Material Contract except where any 

 

35    
  
 

such breach or default would not, individually  or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect  on Huntington
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither Huntington nor any  Subsidiary
of Huntington knows of, or has received notice of, any violation or  default
under (nor, to the knowledge of Huntington, does there exist any condition 
which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result
in  such a violation or default under) any Huntington Material Contract by
any other  party thereto except where any such violation or default would
not, individually  or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect  on Huntington and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Prior to the date hereof,  Huntington has made available to Sky true and
complete copies of all Huntington  Material Contracts.

 

 4.15 _Agreements  with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither Huntington  nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order  or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent  agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment  letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by,  or has been since January 1, 2004, a recipient of any supervisory letter from,  or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or since January 1,  2004, has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request  or suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently  restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any  material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends,  its credit or risk management policies, its management or its business, other  than those of general application that apply to similarly situated financial  holding companies or their Subsidiaries (each, whether or not set forth in  the Huntington Disclosure Schedule, a  " _Huntington Regulatory Agreement_ "),  nor has Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2004,  by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing,  initiating, ordering or requesting any such Huntington Regulatory Agreement. Each  Bank Subsidiary of Huntington is, and to the knowledge of Huntington, there has  not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2004 that could reasonably be  expected to result in a determination that any such Bank Subsidiary is not "well  capitalized" and "well managed" as a matter of U.S. federal banking  law. Each Bank Subsidiary of Huntington has at least a  "satisfactory" rating under the U.S. Community Reinvestment Act.

 

 4.16 _Derivative  Transactions_. Except as would not be reasonably  likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse  Effect on Huntington, (i) all Derivative Transactions, whether entered into  for the account of Huntington or for the account of a customer of Huntington  or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course of business  consistent with past practice and in accordance with prudent banking practice  and applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Authority  and other policies, practices and procedures employed by Huntington and its  Subsidiaries and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible  at the time and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Huntington or one  of its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (except  as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or  similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability  of equitable remedies), and are in full force and effect, (ii) Huntington and  each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed their obligations thereunder to  the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and (iii) to Huntingtons  knowledge, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or  assertions of such by any party thereunder.

 

36    
  
 

 4.17 _Undisclosed  Liabilities_. Except for (i) those liabilities  that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of  Huntington included in the Huntington 10-Q (including any notes thereto) ,  (ii) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated thereby and (iii) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course  of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2006, since such  date, neither Huntington nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability  of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise  and whether due or to become due) that, either individually or in the aggregate,  has had or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington.

 

 4.18 _Environmental  Liability_. There are no legal, administrative,  arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental  investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of  any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in the  imposition, on Huntington of any liability or obligation arising under common  law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation  or ordinance including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation  and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or threatened against Huntington,  which liability or obligation is reasonably likely to have, either individually  or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington. To the knowledge  of Huntington, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim,  action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation  that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,  a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington. Huntington is not subject to any agreement,  order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any Governmental Entity  or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing  that is reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,  a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington.

 

 4.19 _Reorganization_.  As of the date of this Agreement, neither Huntington nor Merger Sub is aware  of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the  Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of  Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 4.20 _Internal  Controls_. (a) None of Huntington or its  Subsidiaries records, systems, controls, data or information are recorded,  stored, maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or  held by any means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,  whether computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and  therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or  its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not, individually or in the  aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a materially adverse effect  on the system of internal accounting controls described in the next sentence.  Huntington and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal  accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

 

 (b) Huntington  (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating  to Huntington including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive  officer and the chief financial officer of Huntington by others within those  entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to  the date hereof, to Huntingtons 

 

37    
  
 

outside auditors and the audit committee  of Huntingtons Board of Directors
(i) any significant deficiencies and  material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably  likely to adversely
affect Huntingtons ability to record, process, summarize  and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,  that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Huntingtons  internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing  by management to Huntingtons auditors and audit
committee and a copy has  previously been made available to Huntington. As of
the date hereof, there is  no reason to believe that its outside auditors and
its chief executive officer  and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations  required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404  of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

 

 (c) Since  December 31, 2005, (i) through the date hereof, neither Huntington nor any of  its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material  complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding  the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of  Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting  controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that  Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting  or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Huntington or any of  its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries,  has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary  duty or similar violation by Huntington or any of its officers, directors, employees  or agents to the Board of Directors of Huntington or any committee thereof or  to any director or officer of Huntington.

 

 4.21 _Huntington  Information_. The information relating  to Huntington and its Subsidiaries that is provided by Huntington and Merger  Sub for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, or the information  relating to Huntington and its Subsidiaries that is provided by Huntington  or Merger Sub or its representatives for inclusion in any other document filed  with any other Regulatory Agency in connection with the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact  or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein,  in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The Form  S-4 will comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and  regulations thereunder in all material respects.

 

 4.22 _Opinion_.  Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Huntington has received an opinion  from each of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers Inc. to the effect that as of the  date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the  Merger Consideration is fair to Huntington from a financial point of view. Such  opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

(a) Huntington and Sky shall  promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement and Huntington  shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint  Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Huntington and Sky  shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective  under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and  each of the parties shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement  to its respective shareholders or stockholders, as applicable. Huntington shall  file the opinions described in _Sections  7.2(c)_ and _7.3(c)_ with  the SEC by post-effective amendment to the Form S-4. Huntington shall also  use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law  or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, and Sky shall furnish all information concerning  Sky and the holders of Sky Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection  with any such action.

 

 (b) The  parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best  efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all  applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable  all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and  Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and to comply with the  terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations  of all such Governmental Entities. Sky and Huntington shall have the right to  review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other  on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,  all the information relating to Sky or Huntington, as the case may be, and any  of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written  materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection  with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing  right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.  The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all  permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental  Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters  relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Huntington  to take any action, or commit to take any 

 

43    
  
 

action, or agree to any condition or restriction,  in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations  of
third parties or Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected  to
have a material adverse effect on Huntington and its Subsidiaries (including 
the Surviving Company after giving effect to the Merger) taken as a whole
after  the Effective Time (a " _Materially Burdensome  Regulatory Condition_
"). In addition,  Sky agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts
to assist Huntington  in preparing and filing such petitions and filings, and
in obtaining such permits,  consents, approvals and authorizations of third
parties and Governmental Entities,  that may be necessary or advisable to
effect any mergers and/or consolidations  of Subsidiaries of Sky and
Huntington following consummation of the Merger.

 

 (c) Each  of Huntington and Sky shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information  concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders or  stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary  or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any  other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Huntington,  Sky or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection  with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 (d) Each  of Huntington, Merger Sub and Sky shall promptly advise the other upon receiving  any communication from any Governmental Entity consent or approval of which is  required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that  any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of  any such approval may be materially delayed.

 

 6.2 _Access  to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice  and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each  of Sky and Huntington shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford  to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives  of the other, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period  prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments  and records, and, during such period, the parties shall, and shall cause its  Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all other information concerning  its business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably request.  Sky shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide to Huntington  a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document  filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of  federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports  or documents that such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable  law). Neither Sky nor Huntington nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required  to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure  would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries  or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary  duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.  The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under  circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

 (b) All  information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject  to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into between the parties  as of July 26, 2006 (the  " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

44    
  
 

 (c) No investigation  by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect the  representations and warranties of the other set forth in this Agreement.

 

 6.3 _Shareholder  Approval_. Sky and Huntington shall each  call a meeting of their respective shareholders and stockholders, as applicable,  to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the  requisite shareholder or stockholder approval required in connection with this  Agreement and the Merger (the " _Sky  Shareholder Meeting_ " and the " _Huntington  Stockholder Meeting_ ," respectively),  and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as  soon as reasonably practicable. The Board of Directors of Sky has resolved  to recommend to Skys shareholders that such shareholders vote in favor  of the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated hereby (the " _Sky Recommendation_ ")  and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval and adoption.  Unless otherwise directed in writing by Huntington, this Agreement and the  Merger shall be submitted to the shareholders of Sky at the Sky Shareholder  Meeting for the purpose of approving the Agreement and the Merger. The Board  of Directors of Huntington has resolved to recommend to its stockholders that  such stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the issuance of shares of  Huntington Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Huntington  Recommendation_ ") and shall use reasonable  best efforts to obtain such approval. Unless otherwise directed in writing  by Sky, such share issuance proposal shall be submitted to the stockholders  of Huntington at the Huntington Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of approving  such issuance of shares of Huntington Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

 

 6.4 _Legal  Conditions to Merger_. Subject to _Section  6.1(b)_ , each of Huntington and Sky shall,  and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i)  to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to  comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party  or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions  set forth in _Article VII_ ,  to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) to  obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent,  authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental  Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by Sky or  Huntington or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger  and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 6.5 _Affiliates_.  Sky shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer  and other person who is an  "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Sky  to deliver to Huntington, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,  and prior to the date of the meeting of the Sky shareholders to be held pursuant  to _Section 6.3_ ,  a written agreement, in the form of _Exhibit  B_.

 

 6.6 _Nasdaq  Approval_. Huntington shall cause the shares  of Huntington Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for quotation  on the Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective  Time.

 

 6.7 _Employee  Matters_. (a) From and after the Effective  Time, the employees of Sky and its Subsidiaries who are employed by the Surviving  Company as of the Effective Time (the " _Assumed  Employees_ ") and who remain employed  with the Surviving Company thereafter will be offered participation and coverage  under Huntington Benefit Plans that are no 

 

45    
  
 

less favorable than the plans generally  in effect for similarly situated
employees of Huntington and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  that continued
participation and coverage following the Effective Time under  the Sky
Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall  be
deemed to satisfy the obligations under this sentence, it being understood 
that the Assumed Employees may commence participating in the comparable
Huntington  Benefit Plans on different dates following the Effective Time
with respect to  different comparable Huntington Benefit Plans.
Notwithstanding any provision  of this _Section 6.7(a)_ to  the contrary,
each Assumed Employee (other than those with individual agreements  providing
for severance or "change of control" benefits) whose employment  terminates
during the 12-month period from and after the Effective Time shall  receive
the greater of the severance pay and benefits under (i) the Huntington 
Transition Pay Plan, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect from
time  to time, or (ii) the Sky Severance Pay Plan, in accordance with the
terms thereof  as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, in
either case to be calculated,  on the basis of the Assumed Employees service
at the time of termination  of employment and the greater of the Assumed
Employees compensation (A)  at the time of termination of employment or (B)
as in effect immediately prior  to the Effective Time. Such severance
benefits shall be provided in all cases  under the terms and procedures set
forth in the Huntington Transition Pay Plan,  except with regard to the
benefit formula as stated above.

 

 (b) Huntington  shall cause each Huntington Benefit Plan in which Assumed Employees are eligible  to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and  benefit accruals under the Huntington Benefit Plans (other than benefit accruals  under any of Huntingtons tax-qualified and non-qualified defined benefit  pension plans) the service of such employees with Sky and its Subsidiaries (and  any predecessor entities) to the same extent as such service was credited for  such purpose by Sky and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _howeve_ r,  that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition  would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of  service or with respect to newly implemented plans for which prior service is  not taken into account. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of Huntington,  Merger Sub or the Surviving Company to amend or terminate any of the Sky Benefit  Plans or Huntington Benefits Plans in accordance with their terms at any time.

 

 (c) At and  following the Effective Time, Huntington will cause the Surviving Company to  honor the obligations of Sky or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time  under the provisions of the Sky Benefit Plans and Sky Employment Agreements, _provided_ that  this provision shall not prevent the Surviving Company from amending, suspending  or terminating any such plans or agreements to the extent permitted by the respective  terms of such plans or agreement.

 

 (d) If Assumed  Employees become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan  of Huntington or its Subsidiaries, Huntington shall cause each such plan to (i)  waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are  covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of Huntington, (ii)  honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses  incurred by such employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the  calendar year prior to such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period  limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable  to such employee on or after the Effective Time for the year in which the Effective  Time or participation in such medical, dental or health plan of Huntington, as  applicable, occurs, 

 

46    
  
 

in each case to the extent such employee  had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous medical,  dental or health plan
of Sky prior to the Effective Time for the year in which  the Effective Time
or participation in such medical, dental or health plan of  Huntington, as
applicable, occurs.

 

 (e) As of  the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall take all action necessary to  effectuate the agreements set forth in _Section  6.7(e)_ of the Huntington Disclosure Schedule.

 

 6.8 _Indemnification;  Directors  and Officers Insurance_.  (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding  or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any  such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual  who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or  who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Sky or any  of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of Sky or any of  its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is,  or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising  in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was  a director or officer of Sky or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) this Agreement  or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted  or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate  and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. From and  after the Effective Time, Huntington shall indemnify and hold harmless, as  and to the fullest extent currently provided under applicable law, the Sky  Articles, the Sky Regulations and any agreement set forth in _Section  6.8_ of the Sky Disclosure Schedule, each  such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,  expenses (including reimbursement for reasonable fees and expenses incurred  in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation  upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments, fines  and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual  claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

 (b) Huntington  shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of Sky or any of  its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a  period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability  insurance policy maintained by Sky ( _provided_ that  Huntington may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and  amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such  policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time  that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; _provided_ that  in no event shall Huntington be required to expend more than 250% per year of  coverage of the amount currently expended by Sky per year of coverage as of the  date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum_ _Amount_ ")  to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto, and (iii) if Huntington  is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this _Section  6.8_ , Huntington shall obtain as much comparable  insurance as available for the Maximum Amount, and (iv) such Indemnified Parties  may be required to make reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary  representations and warranties to Huntingtons insurance carrier for the  purpose of obtaining such insurance, comparable in nature and scope to the applications,  representations and warranties required of persons who are officers and directors  of Huntington as of the date hereof.

 

47    
  
 

 (c) The  provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall  survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall  be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 

 6.9 _Additional  Agreements_. In case at any time after  the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out  the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of  Huntington, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Sky, on the other) or to vest  the Surviving Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,  immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers  and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all  such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense  of, Huntington.

 

 6.10 _Advice  of Changes_. Each of Huntington, Merger  Sub and Sky shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having  or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it  believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material  breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in  this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants  or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions  to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,  that a failure to comply with this _Section  6.10_ shall not constitute the failure  of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to  be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach  would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Article  VII_ to be satisfied.

 

 6.11 _Dividends_.  After the date of this Agreement, Sky shall coordinate with Huntington the declaration  of any dividends in respect of Sky Common Stock and the record dates and payment  dates relating thereto such that holders of Sky Common Stock shall not receive  two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect  to their shares of Sky Common Stock and any shares of Huntington Common Stock  any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 

 6.12 _Exemption  from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Huntington  and Sky agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Sky  Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and  after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Sky Insiders not be subject  to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest  extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares  of Sky Common Stock, Sky Stock Options and Sky Stock Unit Awards into shares  of Huntington Common Stock, Assumed Stock Options and Assumed Stock Unit Awards,  as applicable, in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose  agree to the provisions of this _Section  6.12_. Assuming that Sky delivers to Huntington  the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Board  of Directors of Huntington, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof  (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),  shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by Sky Insiders of Huntington  Common Stock in exchange for shares of Sky Common Stock, of options on Huntington  Common Stock upon conversion of options on Sky Common Stock, and of Assumed  Stock Unit Awards upon conversion of Sky Stock Unit Awards, in each case pursuant  to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent such securities  are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability  pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act.  " _Section_

 

48    
  
 

_16 Information_ " shall  mean information accurate in all material respects
regarding Sky Insiders, the  number of shares of Sky Common Stock held by
each such Sky Insider and expected  to be exchanged for Huntington Common
Stock in the Merger, and the number and  description of the options or stock
unit awards on Sky Common Stock held by each  such Sky Insider and expected
to be converted into options on Huntington Common  Stock or Assumed Stock
Unit Awards, as applicable, in connection with the Merger; _provided_ that 
the requirement for a description of any Sky Stock Options and Sky Stock
Unit  Awards shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all Sky Stock
Plans, and  forms of agreements evidencing grants thereunder, under which
such Sky Stock  Options and Sky Stock Unit Awards have been granted, have
been made available  to Huntington. " _Sky Insiders_ " shall mean those 
officers and directors of Sky who are subject to the reporting requirements
of  Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16

 6.13 _No  Solicitation_.

 

 (a) None  of Sky or Huntington (each, a " _No-Shop  Party_ ") or its respective Subsidiaries  or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment  banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative)  of such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly  (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing  information), or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries  or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets,  sale of shares of capital stock (including, without limitation, by way of a tender  offer) or similar transactions involving such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries  that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the  foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an " _Acquisition  Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any  discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter  into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the Board of Directors of a No-Shop Party shall be permitted, prior  to the meeting of shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, of such No-Shop  Party to be held pursuant to _Section 6.3_ , and subject to compliance  with the other terms of this _Section 6.13_ and  to first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the person proposing  such Acquisition Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable  to such No-Shop Party than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,  to consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to a  bona fide Acquisition Proposal received by such No-Shop Party, if and only to  the extent that the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party reasonably determines  in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to  do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties.

 

 As used  in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means,  in respect of either No-Shop Party, any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which  any person (or group of persons) other than the other No-Shop Party or its affiliates,  directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 25 percent of the  outstanding shares of Sky Common Stock or Huntington Common Stock, as applicable,  or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock  that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger,  whether from such No-Shop Party, or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer  or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business  combination involving such No-Shop Party (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction  pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than the other No-Shop  Party or its affiliates acquires or would acquire control of assets 

 

49    
  
 

(including for this purpose the outstanding  equity securities of
subsidiaries of such No-Shop Party and securities of the  entity surviving
any merger or business combination including any of its Subsidiaries)  of
such No-Shop Party or any of its subsidiaries representing more than 25
percent  of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net
income of such  No-Shop Party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such  transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization  or similar transaction involving such
No-Shop Party or any of its subsidiaries,  other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which  the holders of shares
of Sky Common Stock or Huntington Common Stock, as applicable,  immediately
prior to such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at least  75 percent
of each of the outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding  voting
power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately 
after the consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such
holders  held the shares of Sky Common Stock or Huntington Common Stock, as
applicable,  immediately prior to the consummation thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ ,  that for purposes of _Section 8.3(a)_ of  this Agreement, each
reference to "25 percent" or "75 percent" in  this definition shall be deemed
to be a reference to "50 percent."

 

 (b) Each  No-Shop Party shall notify the other No-Shop Party promptly (but in no event  later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material  modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request  for nonpublic information relating to such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries  or for access to the properties, books or records of such No-Shop Party or any  of its Subsidiaries by any Person or entity that informs the Board of Directors  of such No-Shop Party or any Subsidiary of such No-Shop Party that it is considering  making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to the other No-Shop  Party shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of  the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering  making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access  to the books and records of such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries, and  the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment  to an Acquisition Proposal. Each No-Shop Party shall keep the other No-Shop Party  fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and  any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal,  indication or request. Each No-Shop Party shall also promptly, and in any event  within 24 hours, notify the other No-Shop Party, orally and in writing, if it  enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal in  accordance with _Section 6.13(a)_.

 

 (c) Nothing  contained in this _Section 6.13_ shall  prohibit a No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its  shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, a position required by Rule 14e-2(a)  or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

 (d) Each  No-Shop Party and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated  any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than the other  No-Shop Party) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and  shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than the other No-Shop  Party who have been furnished confidential information regarding such first No-Shop  Party in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition  Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or  destroy such information. Each No-Shop Party agrees not to, and to cause its  Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill 

 

50    
  
 

provisions of any agreement to which such  No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries
is or may become a party, and shall immediately  take all steps necessary to
terminate any approval that may have been heretofore  given under any such
provisions authorizing any person to make an Acquisition  Proposal.

 

 (e) Each  No-Shop Party shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees, agents  and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys,  accountants or other retained representatives) of such No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries  are aware of the restrictions described in this _Section  6.13_ as reasonably necessary to avoid violations  thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in  this _Section 6.13_ by  any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment  banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative)  of a No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent  of such No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of  this _Section 6.13_ by such No-Shop Party.

 

 6.14 _Transition_.  (a) Commencing following the date hereof, Huntington and Sky shall, and shall  cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to  facilitate the integration, from and after the Closing, of Sky and its Subsidiaries  with the businesses of Huntington and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the  generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof through the Closing Date and  consistent with the performance of their day-to-day operations, the continuous  operation of Sky and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and  applicable law, Sky shall cause the employees and officers of Sky and its Subsidiaries,  including the Bank, to cooperate with Huntington in performing tasks reasonably  required in connection with such integration.

 

 (b) Huntington  and Sky agree to consult with respect to their litigation and real estate valuation  policies and practices. Sky shall continue to utilize its existing loan policies  and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves); _provided_ , _however_ ,  that, subject to applicable law, Sky shall not unreasonably withhold or delay  its consent to any reasonable request by Huntington that Sky make modifications  or changes thereto and Sky shall make such changes promptly after granting any  such consent or at such later date as the parties may agree. Huntington and Sky  shall also, subject to applicable law, consult with respect to the character,  amount and timing of restructuring charges to be taken by each of them in connection  with the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall take such charges as Huntington  shall reasonably request. No partys representations, warranties and covenants  contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect  for any purpose as a consequence of any modifications or changes to such policies  and practices which may be undertaken on account of this _Section  6.14_.

  

 6.15 _Commitments  to Sky s Communities_.

through the Sky Foundation at substantially  the same levels as prior to the
Effective Time.

 

 (c) The  commitments set forth in this _Section 6.15_ will  be reflected in the minutes of Huntington following the Closing Date.

54

observe the covenants and agreements of such party set  forth in this
Agreement;

 

 (d) by either  the Board of Directors of Huntington or the Board of Directors of Sky if there  shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the  representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of Sky,  in the case of a termination by Huntington, or Huntington or Merger Sub, in the  case of a termination by Sky, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate,  would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure  of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ ,  as the case may be, and which is not cured within 45 days following written notice  to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured  within such time period;

55    
  
 

this Agreement (the party to which this  clause (A) applies is referred to in
this _Section  8.3(a)_ as the " _applicable  party_ "), (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to _Sections  8.1(g)_ or _8.1(c)_
following  the failure to receive the requisite approval of the applicable
partys  shareholders or stockholders, or (ii) pursuant to _Section  8.1(d)_

the date that is twelve (12) months after  the date of such termination the
applicable party consummates an Alternative  Transaction or enters into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition  agreement or other

This  Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf  of each of the parties.

 

 8.5 _Extension;  Waiver_.

56    
  
 

delivered to the holders of Sky Common  Stock under this Agreement, other
than as contemplated by this Agreement. Any  agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid  only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but  such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, 
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
