In-The-Money Company Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time, in exchange for a payment by the Surviving Corporation, in cash, equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the

(B)&nbsp;the exercise price per Company Share subject to such In-The-Money Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent),

fees with respect to the Notes Commitment Letter and an engagement letter with respect to the Notes Commitment Letter, each dated as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements,
Contracts or arrangements related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt Financing that are payable on or prior to the date hereof, and, as of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters. As of the date
hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,

satisfied. Parent, Merger Sub and Merger&nbsp;LLC will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to (i)&nbsp;pay the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company
Shares, Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares pursuant to Sections&nbsp;2.1 and 2.2, (ii)&nbsp;pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub,
