 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively, the " _Company Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive (i) $5.00 in cash, without interest and (ii) 0.588 Parent Shares (such Parent Shares and cash, together with any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof, without interest, less any required withholding Taxes, and further subject to payment by Parent of cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Share pursuant to Section 2.5. All Company Shares that have been converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as set forth in this Section 2.1(a) shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist.

shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof, and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

 (c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding as a share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

  

 Section 2.2 _ Treatment of Options and Restricted Shares._ 

  

  

 (a) Except with respect to options under the Company ESPP (as defined below), the Company shall take all such action as may be required to fully vest each option or similar right (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any stock option, stock purchase or equity compensation plan, arrangement or agreement of the Company (the " _Company Equity Plans_ ") as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. If the holder so elects in writing, each In-The-Money Company Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time, in exchange for a payment by the Surviving Corporation, in cash, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Company Shares subject to such In-The-Money Option, multiplied by (ii) the aggregate value of the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Amount over (B) the exercise price per Company Share subject to such In-The-Money Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less the amount of any required withholding. To the extent that a holder of an In-The-Money Option does not elect (in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent) that a particular Company Stock Option be treated in the manner described in the prior sentence, that Company Stock Option shall instead be treated as an "Out-Of-The-Money Option" for all purposes. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, all rights with respect to Company Shares under each Out-Of-The-Money Option shall be converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each such Out-Of-The-Money Option. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each Out-Of-The-Money Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Out-Of-The-Money Option shall be equal to the number of Company Shares subject to such Out-Of-The-Money Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by 0.9559, rounding up to the nearest whole share, (iii) the per share exercise price under each such Out-Of-The-Money Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under such Out-Of-The-Money Option by 0.9559 and rounding up to the nearest cent, and (iv) any restriction on the exercise of any such Out-Of-The-Money Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, and other provisions of such Out-Of-The-Money Option shall otherwise remain unchanged (except that such Out-Of-The Money Option shall be fully vested pursuant to the first sentence of Section 2.2(a)); _provided_ , _however_ , that each Out-Of-The-Money Option assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 2.2(b) shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction effected subsequent to the Effective Time. 

  

      

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock granted under a Company Equity Plan or otherwise (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Restricted Shares held by such holder, multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Amount (with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less the amount of any required withholding. 

   

 (d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board or the compensation committee of the Company Board will adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended from time to time prior to the date hereof, the " _Company ESPP_ "): (i) participants in the Company ESPP may not alter their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in the Company ESPP); (ii) no offering period will be commenced after the date of this Agreement (it being understood that any offering period in effect on the date hereof may continue in accordance with its terms, subject to the next clause); (iii) the Company ESPP and all offering periods then in effect shall be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iv) the amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, without interest. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to effect the measures contemplated by this Section 2.2, including but not limited to adoption of any resolutions, interpretations, plan amendments, offering to enter into the elections contemplated by Section 2.2(a) within a reasonable period of time prior to the Effective Date, seeking Company Board approval and/or seeking any consents, and to ensure that, on and after the Effective Time, no holder of an In-The-Money Option or Company Restricted Stock has any further rights with respect thereto (other than to receive the payments provided for in this Section 2.2) and that no holder of an Out-Of-The-Money Option has any further rights with respect thereto (other than the rights provided for in this Section 2.2) and that no Company ESPP participant has any further rights with respect thereto (other than the rights provided for in this Section 2.2). 

  

 (f) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, (i) the Company Equity Plans shall terminate and (ii) no holder of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and no participant in any Company Equity Plan or any other employee incentive or benefit plan, program or arrangement or any non-employee director plan maintained by the Company shall have any rights to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries, except the conversion rights contemplated by Section 2.1 or this Section 2.2. 

  

 (g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all notices required by the Company Equity Plans or contemplated by this Section 2.2 (which notices shall have been approved by Parent, in its reasonable discretion) to each holder of Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares, setting forth each holder\'s or participant\'s rights pursuant to the applicable Company Equity Plan and this Section 2.2 stating that such Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Shares, as applicable, shall be treated in the manner set forth in this Section 2.2. 

  

  

 Section 2.3 _ Exchange and Payment._ 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with the Company\'s transfer agent to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the Merger Consideration to which stockholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to this Article II. Promptly, and in no event later than 1 

  

      

  

Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent (i) stock certificates representing Parent
Shares and (ii) cash, in each case in an aggregate amount equal to the number
of Parent Shares and amount of cash into which Company Shares have been
converted in accordance with Section 2.1(a). Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent will provide to the Company written certification from the
commitment parties under the Commitment Letters that they will release funds
after the Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall deposit with the Paying
Agent, as necessary from time to time at or after the Effective Time, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.5 and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.6. All Parent
Shares, cash and dividends and distributions deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_ ". The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments due pursuant to this Article II, except as provided in
this Agreement.

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares (" _Company Certificates_ ") that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (A) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form and contain such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.2. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Company Share formerly represented by such Company Certificate (subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax), and such Company Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than 5 Business Days following the Effective Time), to the extent consistent with the Paying Agent\'s standard procedures, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to issue and deliver the Merger Consideration to holders of uncertificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (the " _Book-Entry Company Shares_ ") (either directly or through the Depository Trust Company), without each holder of Book-Entry Company Shares being required to deliver a Company Certificate or any executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Company Shares shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Company Certificate representing such Company Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or the right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the shares represented thereby as contemplated by Section 2.7, as applicable. 

  

 (c) At any time following the date that is 12 months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that have been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to holders of Company Certificates and Book-Entry Company Shares and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the 

  

      

  
  

Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Company Certificates
and Book-Entry Company Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges
and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
exchange of Company Shares for the Merger Consideration.

   

 (d) All cash paid and Parent Shares issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares, formerly represented by such Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Company Shares, such Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article II. 

  

 (e) The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; _provided_ that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Shares and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. 

  

 (f) None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any person in respect of Parent Shares, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, any cash in lieu of fractional shares or any cash from the Payment Fund, in each case properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (g) In the event that any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holder\'s compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in a reasonable and customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Company Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares represented by such Company Certificate pursuant to this Article II. 

   

 (h) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(a) to pay for Company Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected as described in Section 2.7 shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

  

  

 Section 2.4 _ Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

       

                                      
Section 2.5 _ Fractional Shares._ No certificates or scrip representing
a fractional Parent Share shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares evidencing Company Shares,
and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu thereof, upon
surrender of the applicable Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares,
Parent shall pay each holder of Company Shares an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest in Parent to
which such holder (after taking into account all Company Shares held at the
Effective Time) would otherwise be entitled, by (b) the Average Parent Trading
Price.

   

 Section 2.6 _ Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Company Shares._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares issuable with respect to Company Shares shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares until those Company Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares are surrendered as provided in this Article II. Upon surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the Parent Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those Parent Shares with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of this surrender and not previously paid and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those Parent Shares with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. 

  

 Section 2.7 _ Appraisal Rights._ 

  

  

 (a) So long as the Company Common Stock is listed on the Global Select Market of NASDAQ (i) on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote on the Merger with respect to mergers other than mergers pursuant to Section 3-106 of the MGCL or (ii) the date notice is given or waived under Section 3-106 of the MGCL in connection with a merger of a ninety percent (90%) owned subsidiary with or into its parent as the case may be (as applicable, the " _Appraisal Date_ "), no stockholder of the Company shall have any rights under Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) If the Company Common Stock is not listed on the Global Select Market of NASDAQ on the Appraisal Date, Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and shall have delivered a written demand for appraisal of such Company Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 3-203 of the MGCL and shall not have failed to perfect or shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal and payment under the MGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled to receive the consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the MGCL, such holder\'s Company Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 2.1(a), without any interest thereon. 

  

 (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written objection to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 3-203 of the MGCL received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the MGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the MGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 (a) Subject to Sections 5.7(b)-(f), the Company agrees that neither it nor any subsidiary of the Company shall, and that it shall direct its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its subsidiaries (" _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage (including by providing information) or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or the making or completion of, a Company Alternative Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations concerning, or provide or cause to be provided any non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with, or have any discussions (other than to state that they are not permitted to have discussions) with any person relating to, an actual or proposed Company Alternative Proposal, or otherwise knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement a Company Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Company Alternative Proposal, (iv) amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement, (v) approve any transaction by which any third party would otherwise have become an "interested stockholder" under Section 3-601 of the MGCL, or (vi) agree to do any of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however,_ that it is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the Company Board permitted under Sections 5.7(c) or (d) or Section 7.1(c)(iii) shall not be deemed to be a breach or violation 

  

      

  

of this Section 5.7(a). The Company acknowledges and agrees that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any
Representative of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to
constitute a breach of this Section 5.7(a) by the Company.

  

 (b) The Company shall, shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, and shall direct each of its Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any person (other than the parties hereto) that has made or indicated an intention to make a Company Alternative Proposal, in each case that exist as of the date hereof. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 5.7(a) or (b), prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives an unsolicited Company Alternative Proposal which did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of Section 5.7(a) and the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, that such Company Alternative Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal and the Company Board, or any committee thereof, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be a breach of the directors\' duties under applicable Law, the Company may (i) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to the person making such Company Alternative Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in order for the Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and it being understood that the Company may enter into a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision) and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding such Company Alternative Proposal; _provided_ , _however,_ that the Company shall concurrently therewith provide or make available to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is provided to the person making such Company Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to Parent. 

   

 (d) Subject to the permitted actions contemplated by Section 7.1(c)(iii), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC, the Company Recommendation or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Company Alternative Proposal (any action described in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to as a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to effect a Company Change of Recommendation could reasonably be expected to be a breach of their duties as directors under applicable Law, the Company Board or any committee thereof may effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response to (1) a Company Superior Proposal or (2) any material event, development, circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or facts not related to a Company Alternative Proposal that was not known to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (a " _Company Intervening Event_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to effect a Company Change of Recommendation unless (A) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice (a " _Proposal Notice_ ") to Parent that it is prepared to make a Company Change of Recommendation which notice shall, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is related to a Company Superior Proposal, contain a description of the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal, including a copy of the definitive agreement in the form to be entered into (if any), or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is related to a Company Intervening Event, contain a description of the event, development, circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or facts giving rise to such proposed action and (B) Parent does not make, within 

  

      

  
  

three Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal (a "
_Subsequent Parent Proposal_ ") that would, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel and, in the case of a
Company Superior Proposal, the Company\'s financial advisor), cause such
Company Intervening Event to no longer form the basis for the Company Board
to effect a Company Change of Recommendation or cause the offer previously
constituting a Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Company
Superior Proposal, as the case may be. If Parent has made a Subsequent Parent
Proposal and there is any material change made to the financial terms or to
other material terms of the Company Superior Proposal prior to the
Company\'s making a Company Change of Recommendation or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii), the Company shall provide to Parent
a new Proposal Notice and Parent shall have a period of 48 hours after the
receipt of such new Proposal Notice to make another proposal, which will be
otherwise subject to the provisions of this Section 5.7(d).

  

 (e) The Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any written Company Alternative Proposal, (ii) any written request for non-public information relating to the Company or its subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related to a Company Alternative Proposal, and (iii) any written inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation regarding a Company Alternative Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making any such Company Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry and the material terms of any such Company Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed on a current basis of the status of, and any material changes or proposed material changes to, the terms of any such Company Alternative Proposal and the status of discussions and negotiations thereto. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to disclose such information would reasonably be expected to violate the obligations of the Company\'s directors under applicable Law. 

  

 (g) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group of persons other than Parent or one of its subsidiaries for (i) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving an acquisition of the Company (or any subsidiary or subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (ii) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over 20% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case other than the Merger and the LLC Merger. 

  

 (h) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any Company Alternative Proposal on terms which the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and taking into consideration, among other things, all of the terms, conditions, impact, timing, likelihood of consummation and all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Company Alternative Proposal and this Agreement, would result in a transaction that is more favorable to the holders of Company Shares from a financial point of view than the transactions provided for in this Agreement; _provided_  that for purposes of the definition of "Company Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" in the definition of Company Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"). 

  

      

                                       
Section 5.8 _ No Solicitation by Parent._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to Sections 5.8(b)-(f), Parent agrees that neither it nor any subsidiary of Parent shall, and that it shall direct its and their Representatives, not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage (including by providing information) or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or the making or completion of, a Parent Alternative Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations concerning, or provide or cause to be provided any non-public information or data relating to Parent or any of its subsidiaries in connection with, or have any discussions (other than to state that they are not permitted to have discussions) with any person relating to, an actual or proposed Parent Alternative Proposal, or otherwise knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement a Parent Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Parent Alternative Proposal, (iv) amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement, or (v) agree to do any of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however,_ that it is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the Parent Board permitted under Sections 5.8(c) or (d), shall not be deemed to be a breach or violation of this Section 5.8(a). Parent acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of Parent or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 5.8(a) by Parent. 

  

 (b) Parent shall, shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, and shall direct each of its Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any person (other than the parties hereto) that has made or indicated an intention to make a Parent Alternative Proposal, in each case that exist as of the date hereof. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 5.8(a) or (b), prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, if Parent receives an unsolicited Parent Alternative Proposal which did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of Section 5.8(a) and the Parent Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, that such Parent Alternative Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal (without regard to the first proviso in the definition thereof) and the Parent Board, or any committee thereof, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be a breach of the directors\' duties under applicable Law, Parent may (i) furnish non-public information with respect to Parent and its subsidiaries to the person making such Parent Alternative Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in order for Parent to be able to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and it being understood that Parent may enter into a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision) and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding such Parent Alternative Proposal; _provided_ , _however,_ that Parent shall concurrently therewith provide or make available to the Company any material non-public information concerning Parent or any of its subsidiaries that is provided to the person making such Parent Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to the Company. 

  

 (d) Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Recommendation or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Parent Alternative Proposal (any action described in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to as a " _Parent Change of Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to effect a Parent Change of 

  

      

  
  

Recommendation could reasonably be expected to be a breach of their duties as
directors under applicable Law, the Parent Board or any committee thereof may
effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in response to (1) a Parent Superior
Proposal or (2) any material event, development, circumstance, occurrence or
change in circumstances or facts not related to a Parent Superior
Proposal that was not known to the Parent Board as of the date of this
Agreement (a " _Parent Intervening Event_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall not be entitled to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation
unless (A) Parent shall have first provided a Proposal Notice to the Company
that it is prepared to make a Parent Change of Recommendation which notice
shall contain a description of the event, development, circumstance,
occurrence or change in circumstances or facts giving rise to such proposed
action, including the material terms of a Parent Superior Proposal, if any,
and (B) the Company does not make, within three Business Days after the
receipt of such notice, a proposal (a " _Subsequent Company Proposal_ ") that
would, in the good faith judgment of the Parent Board (after consultation
with outside counsel and, in the case of a Parent Superior Proposal, Parent\'s
financial advisor), cause such Parent Intervening Event or Parent Superior
Proposal to no longer form a basis for the Parent Board to effect a Parent
Change of Recommendation under this Section 5.8(d). Any material changes with
respect to such event, development, circumstance, occurrence or change in
circumstances or facts mentioned above occurring prior to Parent\'s effecting
a Parent Change of Recommendation shall require Parent to provide to
the Company a new Proposal Notice and the Company shall have a period of 48
hours after the receipt of such new Proposal Notice to make another proposal,
which will be otherwise subject to the provisions of this Section 5.8(d).

  

 (e) Parent promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise the Company orally and in writing of (i) any written Parent Alternative Proposal, (ii) any written request for non-public information relating to Parent or its subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related to a Parent Alternative Proposal, and (iii) any written inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation regarding a Parent Alternative Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making any such Parent Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry and the material terms of any such Parent Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry. Parent shall keep the Company fully informed on a current basis of the status of, and any material changes or proposed material changes to, the terms of any such Parent Alternative Proposal and the status of discussions and negotiations thereto. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or the Parent Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to Parent\'s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Parent Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to disclose such information would reasonably be expected to violate the obligations of Parent\'s directors under applicable Law. 

  

 (g) As used in this Agreement, " _Parent Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group of persons for (i) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving an acquisition of Parent (or any subsidiary or subsidiaries of Parent whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (ii) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over 20% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of Parent and its subsidiaries. 

  

 (h) As used in this Agreement, " _Parent Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any Parent Alternative Proposal on terms which the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Parent\'s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and taking into consideration, among other things, all of the terms, conditions, impact, timing, likelihood of consummation and all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Parent Alternative Proposal and this Agreement, 

  

      

  
  

would result in a transaction that is more favorable to the holders of Parent
Shares from a financial point of view than the transactions provided for in
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Parent Alternative
Proposal is conditioned, expressly by its terms or otherwise, on the Merger
not being consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
_provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Parent Superior Proposal,"
the references to "20%" in the definition of Parent Alternative Proposal shall
be deemed to be references to "50%").

  

  

 Section 5.9 _ Employment and Employee Benefits Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and each of their subsidiaries to maintain for any Company Employee, for a 6-month period commencing at the Effective Time, benefits provided under Company Plans that are qualified defined contribution or group health plans that in the aggregate (and, as determined by Parent) are no less favorable than the overall benefits provided to such Company Employees under the Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but only for the purpose of determining vacation and severance entitlements), under any employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation and severance) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company Employees\' service with the Company, its subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent or its subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. 

  

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each existing employment, change in control, severance and termination protection plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of that company, (ii) all equity-based plans, programs or agreements, bonus plans or programs and (iii) all obligations pursuant to outstanding restoration plans, equity-based plans, programs or agreements, bonus plans or programs, bonus deferral plans, vested and accrued benefits under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or its subsidiaries and similar employment compensation and benefit arrangements and agreements in effect as of the Effective Time, in each case to the extent legally binding on the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.9, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Company Plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) shall confer upon any person (including Company Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries) any rights as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. 

  

  

 Section 5.10 _ Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance._ 

  

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under any employment agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall or shall cause, prior to the LLC Merger, the Surviving Corporation or, after the LLC Merger, the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold 

  

      

  

harmless, to the fullest extent to which such persons are entitled to be
indemnified and held harmless under the MGCL as of the date of this Agreement,
each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director or
employee of the Company and its subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys\' fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party is or
was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or
non-profit entity or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company to the fullest extent to which
such Indemnified Party is entitled to such payment as of the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the MGCL or the Charter
or Bylaws, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification, (y) neither Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents, and (z) the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  

 (b) All rights to indemnification, expenses and exculpation existing in favor of the former or present directors and officers for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Charter and Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and the LLC Merger and shall be observed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company to the fullest extent permitted by Law for a period of 6 years from the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for 6 years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company (the " _Existing D andO Policies_") ( _provided_ that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no event shall the aggregate costs of such insurance policies exceed in any one year during such 6 year period 300% of the current aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company for such purpose (which aggregate annual premiums with respect to such period are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be in the amount set forth in Section 5.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), it being understood that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with respect to each year during such 6 year period, as may be obtained for such 300% annual amount. Parent may, if requested by the Company prior to Closing, cause to be acquired a 6 year tail policy for the Indemnified Parties currently covered by the Existing DandO Policies that is consistent with the first sentence of this 

  

      

  
  

paragraph (c). Any such policy shall be prepaid at the Effective Time and
shall be non-cancelable. Parent agrees to honor and perform under, and to
cause the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company to honor and
perform under, all indemnification agreements with Indemnified Parties entered
into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the date of
this Agreement.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions and benefits of this Section 5.10 shall continue in full effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

  

 (e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. 

  

 (f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in Section 5.9 and this Section 5.10. 

  

  

 Section 5.11 _ Further Action; Efforts._ 

  

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with each other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable (including under any Antitrust Law) to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable and (ii) do all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger, the LLC Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest practicable date, including: (A) causing the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the Merger and the LLC Merger and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite consent or expiration of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act; (B) using best efforts to defend all lawsuits and other proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the LLC Merger; (C) using best efforts to resolve any objection asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement under any Antitrust Law raised by any Governmental Entity and to prevent the entry of any court order, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any injunction, decree, ruling, order or other action of any Governmental Entity that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (D) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from any Governmental Entities or other third parties. 

  

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 5.11(a), each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly as practicable, and in any event by no later than 5 Business Days from the date of this Agreement an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act. Parent shall pay all filing fees and other charges for the filings required under the HSR Act by the Company and Parent. 

   

 (c) If a party receives a request for information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated 

  

      

  
  

hereby, including but not limited to Second Request for Information under the
HSR Act, then such party shall in good faith make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, a
response which is, at a minimum, in substantial compliance with such request.

In particular, to the extent permitted by Law or Governmental Entity, no party will make any notification in relation to the transactions contemplated hereunder without first providing the other party with a copy of such notification in draft form and giving such other party a reasonable opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant Governmental Entities, and such first party shall consider and take account of all reasonable comments timely made by the other party in this respect; 

  

 (ii) furnishing to the other party all information within its possession that is required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party pursuant to the applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

   

 (iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and ensuring to the extent permitted by Law or Governmental Entity that each of the parties is entitled to attend any meetings with or other appearances before any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (iv) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the Antitrust Laws; and 

   

 (v) without prejudice to any rights of the parties hereunder, consulting and cooperating in all respects with the other in defending all lawsuits and other proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

    

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially and/or competitively sensitive information and materials of a party will be provided to the other party on an outside counsel-only basis while, to the extent feasible, making a version in which the commercial and/or competitively sensitive information has been redacted available to the other party.

Commitment Letters (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained
therein or otherwise).
