<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>Internal Controls and Procedures</U>. The Company has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, as such terms are
defined in, and as required by, Rules&nbsp;13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company&#146;s
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company&#146;s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections&nbsp;302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#147;<B>Sarbanes-Oxley Act</B>&#148;). The Company&#146;s management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s system of internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the
fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2006, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective
and the Company&#146;s independent registered accountant has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or
qualified) an attestation report concluding that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of January&nbsp;31, 2006. Since January&nbsp;31, 2006 and through the date
hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, no events, facts or circumstances have occurred, or exist,
such that management would not be able to complete its assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2007, and conclude,
after such assessment, that such controls were effective. The principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries has established and maintains, adheres to and enforces a system of
internal controls over financial reporting, which are effective in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
(including the Company Financials) for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including
policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with appropriate
authorizations of management and the Board of Directors of the Company, and (iii)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, since the date of the
Company&#146;s most recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
(including any Employee (as defined in Section&nbsp;2.12(a)), nor the Company&#146;s independent auditors has
identified or been made aware of (A)&nbsp;any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (B)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Company&#146;s management or
other Employees), or (C)&nbsp;any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing. In connection
with the periods covered by the Company Financials, the Company has disclosed to Parent all
deficiencies and weaknesses identified in writing by the Company or the Company&#146;s independent
auditors (whether current or former) in

that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to Parent&#146;s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications

Parent&#146;s independent registered accountant has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified)
an attestation report concluding that Parent maintained effective internal controls over financial

financial officer of Parent have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any

adheres to and enforces a system of internal control over financial reporting, which are effective

preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including
policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and
expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with appropriate
authorizations of management and the Board of Directors of Parent, and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of Parent&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Parent, since the date of Parent&#146;s most recent Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including any Employee), nor Parent&#146;s
independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (A)&nbsp;any significant deficiency or
