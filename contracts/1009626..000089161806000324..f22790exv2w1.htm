state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

previously furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of any
amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed with the SEC but
which are required to be filed, to agreements, documents or other instruments
which previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the

Other than liabilities (A) disclosed in the Company Financials or (B) incurred since the date of the Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a nature required by GAAP to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet or in the notes thereto which are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

circumstances have occurred, or exist, such that management would not be able
to complete its assessment of the effectiveness of Parents system
of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended October 28, 2006, and conclude, after such assessment, that such

its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Parent, since the date of Parents most
recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries (including any Employee), nor Parents independent auditors has

 3.9 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, overtly threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, before any court, Governmental Entity, or any arbitrator that seek to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or which would reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate with all such claims, actions or proceedings, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 (a) _Benefit Plan Compliance_. 

   

 (i) With respect to the benefit plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would be Benefit Plans if sponsored or maintained by the Company or a Controlled Group Affiliate ("Parent Benefit Plan"), no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries would be subject to any material liability under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Legal Requirement, which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

  

 (ii) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been, in all material respects, administered and operated in accordance with its terms, with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable material Legal Requirements and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements. Each Parent Benefit Plan, including any amendments thereto, that is capable of Approval has received such Approval or there remains a period of time in which to obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of any amendment that has not previously received such Approval, 

   ##### 

  

    

except for the lack of such Approvals which would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

  

 (iii) No material oral or written representation or commitment with respect to any material aspect of any Parent Benefit Plan has been made to an Employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by an authorized Employee of Parent that is not in accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such Parent Benefit Plans, except for such representations or commitments which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

  

 (iv) There are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, any Parent Benefit Plan (other than routine undisputed claims for benefits), and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced with respect to any such claim, except for such claims or disputes which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

  

 (b) _Plan Funding_. With respect to the Parent Benefit Plans, there are no material benefit or funding obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued, or will not be offset by insurance, and there are no material benefit or funding obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with the requirements of GAAP, on the financial statements of Parent. The assets of each Parent Benefit Plan which is funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and records of such Parent Benefit Plan. 

   

 (c) _No Pension or Welfare Plans_. Neither Parent nor any Controlled Group Affiliate with Parent has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any (i) Parent Benefit Plan which is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii) "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (iii) "multiple employer plan" as defined in ERISA or the Code, or (iv) "funded welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code. No Parent Employee Plan provides health benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance contract. 

   

 (d) _Continuation Coverage_. No Parent Benefit Plan provides post-termination or retiree welfare benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to any Person for any reason (other than coverage mandated by applicable Legal Requirements) and neither Parent nor any Controlled Group Affiliate has ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Employee (either individually or to Employees as a group) or any other Person that such Employee(s) or other Person would be provided with post-termination or retiree welfare benefits, except to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements or as would not otherwise reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

   

 (e) _Labor_. Parent is not presently, nor has it been in the past, a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to Employees and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no activities or proceedings of any labor union in the United States to 

    ##### 

  

    

organize any Employees. There is no labor dispute, strike or work stoppage
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened or reasonably anticipated which may materially interfere
with the respective business activities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.
None of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective representatives or Employees has committed any material unfair
labor practice in connection with the operation of the respective businesses
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no actions, suits, claims,
labor disputes or grievances pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to any labor, safety or
discrimination matters involving any Employee, including charges of unfair
labor practices or discrimination complaints, which, if adversely determined,
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair
labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have incurred any material
liability or material obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or any similar state or local law which
remains unsatisfied.

 (a) no underground storage tanks and no amount of any Hazardous Material are present as a result of the actions of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any affiliate of Parent, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, as a result of any actions of any third party or otherwise, in, on or under any property, including the land and the improvements, ground water and surface water thereof, that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has at any time owned, operated, occupied or leased; 

   

 (b) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has disposed of, transported, stored, sold, used, manufactured, disposed of, released, generated or exposed its Employees or others to, or distributed, manufactured, sold, transported or disposed of any product containing a Hazardous Material in violation of any Hazardous Materials Laws;

 (e) to the Knowledge of Parent there are no facts or circumstances likely to prevent or delay timely compliance by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with the European Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment or European Directive 2002/95/EC on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. 

   

 3.13 _Material Contracts_.(a) All Parent Material Contracts (as defined below) are valid and in full force and effect except to the extent they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably 

   ##### 

  

    

be expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated any provision
of, or committed or failed to perform any act which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both would constitute a default under the provisions of, any
Parent Material Contract, except in each case for those violations
and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To
the Knowledge of Parent, no third party has violated any provision of, or
committed or failed to perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both would constitute a default under the provisions of, any
Company Material Contract, except in each case for those violations and
defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Material Contract" shall mean any Contract
of Parent that meets the definitions set forth in item (i) and (ii) of Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. 

  

 3.14 _Disclosure_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, will, at the time the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the stockholders of Parent and the Company, the time of the Parent and Company Stockholders Meetings or as of the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein about the Company supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Parent has taken all action so that (a) the Company shall not be an "Acquiring Person" under the Parent Rights Agreement and (b) the entering into of this Agreement and the Merger and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the grant of any rights to any Person under the Parent Rights Agreement or enable or require the Parent Rights to be exercised, distributed or triggered as a result thereof.

   ##### 

  

    

Offer that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to the stockholders of
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, may recommend that its
stockholders accept the tender or exchange offer (any of the foregoing

 (5) Its Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; and 

  

 (6) It shall not have breached in any material respect any of the provisions set forth in Section 5.2 or this Section 5.3 (including clause (B) of Section 5.3(c)(i)) with respect to such Superior Offer. 

  

 (ii) Other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Offer (which shall be subject to Section 5.3(d)(i) and not subject to this Section 5.3(d)(ii)), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, from making a Change of Recommendation to the extent that such Board of Directors determines in good faith, following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that such party shall send to the other party

Neither Parent nor the Company shall submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or propose to do so. 

   

 (f) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or the Company or their respective Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that the content of any such disclosure thereunder shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement, including with respect to any Change of Recommendation as set forth in Section 5.3(d).

 5.9 _Equity Awards and Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) _Assumption of Stock Options_.

Each assumed Company Option shall be vested immediately following the Effective Time as to the same percentage of the total number of shares subject thereto as it was vested as to immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such Company Option by its terms in effect prior to the date hereof provides for acceleration of vesting. As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent will use all reasonable efforts to issue to each Person who holds an assumed Company Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company Option by Parent. 

   

 (b) _Incentive Stock Options_. The conversion of Company Options provided for in Section 5.9, with respect to any options which are intended to be "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. 

   

 (c) _Company Stock-Based Awards_.

 (d) _Service Recognition_. Subject to Section 5.9(d), as of the Closing Date and for a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, will either (i) continue Company Benefit Plans other than the 401(k) Plans (as provided pursuant to Section 5.9(h)), (ii) permit Employees of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries who continue employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date ("Continuing Employees"), and, as applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in the employee benefit 

    ##### 

  

 

plans, programs or policies (including, without limitation, any
generally available vacation, sick, personal time off plans or programs, but

plan of Parent intended to qualify within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Code on terms no less favorable than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) and (ii).
To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents participate in its employee benefit plans, program or policies
(other than stock compensation plans or arrangements) following the Closing
Date, (A) each such Continuing Employee will receive credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and vacation, sick, personal time off
(but not for purposes of benefit accrual) under such plan, program or policy
for years of service with the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries), including
predecessor employers prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that such credit
(1) does not result in a duplication of benefits, compensation, incentive or
otherwise and (2) does not result in an increase in the level of benefits to
which a similarly situated employee of Parent would be entitled, (B) Parent
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any and all pre-existing
condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence
of insurability requirements under any group health plans of Parent in which
such employees and their eligible dependents will participate to be waived
will use its reasonable best efforts to provide credit for any co-payments
and deductibles prior to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying
any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any
such plans that may apply after the Closing Date, and (C) for each Continuing
Employee who is a participant, and maintains a positive account balance, in a
flexible spending account for medical or dependent care expenses under a
Company Benefit Plan pursuant to Section 125 and 129 of the Code ("Companys
FSA"), if Parent, in its sole discretion, elects to terminate the Companys
FSA during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, on the first day
the Continuing Employees are eligible to participate in the flexible spending
account for medical or dependent care expenses under a Parent Benefit
Plan pursuant to Section 125 and 129 of the Code ("Parents FSA"), Parent
agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable
Legal Requirements, to cause Parents FSA to assume each such Continuing
Employees account balance under the Companys FSA and the elections
made thereunder attributable to such Continuing Employee. 

   

 (e) _Continuing Employee Compensation_. For a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, compensate each Continuing Employee with cash compensation, including base salary rate and target bonus opportunity and cash severance benefits, on terms no less favorable in the aggregate than the total cash compensation opportunity and cash severance benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Nothing herein shall (i) require Parent to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee or (ii) limit Parents ability and discretion to change or amend the total cash compensation opportunity and cash severance benefits to which a Continuing Employee may be entitled provided that, following such change or amendment, the total cash compensation opportunity and cash severance benefits payable to such Continuing Employee are on terms no less favorable in the aggregate than the total cash compensation opportunity and cash severance benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. 

   

 (f) _Severance/Retention_. From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the 

    #####

Date, the Companys retention plan (as disclosed in Annex 2 of the Company
Disclosure Letter); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may amend or
terminate such plan at any time provided that no such amendment or
termination may adversely affect an eligible employees right to a retention
bonus without the employees written consent. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in the event a Continuing Employee is
terminated involuntarily and without cause on or prior to the date that is 90
days following the Closing Date and such Continuing Employee is not

As of the close of business on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have terminated the Company Purchase Plan and provided such notice of termination as may be required by the terms of the Company Purchase Plan. The form and substance of any such notice regarding the Company Purchase Plan termination shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 (h) _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. 

   

 (i) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be adopted prior to the Closing Date resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors to cease all contributions to any and all 401(k) plans maintained or sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "401(k) Plans"), and to terminate the 401(k) Plans, on the day preceding the Closing Date. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall deliver to Parent an executed copy of such resolutions as soon as practicable following their adoption by the Companys Board of Directors and shall fully comply with such resolutions. 

   

 (ii) To the extent the 401(k) Plans are terminated in accordance with Section 5.9(h), Parent shall cause the tax-qualified defined contribution plan established or maintained by Parent ("Parents Savings Plan") to accept eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from Continuing Employees with respect to any account balances distributed to them by the 401(k) Plans. Rollovers of outstanding loans under the 401(k) Plans shall be permitted. The distribution and rollover described herein shall comply with applicable Legal Requirements and each party shall make all filings and take any actions required of such party under applicable Legal Requirements in connection therewith. Each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate in Parents Savings Plan as of the Closing Date. 

    ##### 

  

  

 (iii) If, in accordance with Section 5.9(h), Parent requests in writing that the Company not terminate the 401(k) Plans, the Company shall take such actions as Parent may reasonably require in furtherance of the assumption of the 401(k) Plans by Parent, including, but not limited to, adopting such amendments as Parent may deem necessary or advisable in connection with such assumption. 

   

 (i) _Communications_. Neither the Company nor any officer or member of the Board of Directors of the Company shall communicate in writing to Employees regarding any matters discussed in this Section 5.9, without the consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Neither the Company nor any officer or member of the Board of Directors of the Company will make any oral communications to Employees that are inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 5.9. 

   

 (j) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality of Section 8.5, or any specific applicability thereof, with respect to the legal enforceability of the foregoing, this Section 5.9 is intended to be for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and this Section 5.9 is not intended to confer upon any other Person (including any Continuing Employee) any rights or remedies hereunder. 

   

 5.10 _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) _Indemnity_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Person who is now or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim or action that is based in whole or in part on, or arises in whole or in part out of, the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), to the same extent such Persons are entitled to be indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, or the Subsidiary Charter Documents of its Subsidiaries, and indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in existence on the date hereof with such Persons. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by law. 

    ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Insurance_. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be maintained in effect the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company covering those Persons who are covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date hereof (the "DandO Insurance") for events occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company for a period of six years;  _provided_ that if the existing DandO Insurance expires, is terminated or is canceled during such six-year period, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use its reasonable best efforts to substitute therefor policies containing terms and conditions which are no less favorable than those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and to the extent the annual premium would exceed 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such 250% of such annual premium). To the extent that a six year "tail" policy to extend the Companys existing DandO Insurance is available prior to the Closing such that the lump sum payment for such coverage does not exceed six times 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the Company shall obtain such "tail" policy and such "tail" policy shall satisfy Parents obligation under this Section 5.10. 

   

 (c) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Section 5.10 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honors the obligations set forth with respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this Section 5.10. 

   

 5.11 _Form S-8_. Parent agrees to file with the SEC, no later than 15 business days after the date on which the Closing Date, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form), if available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Options eligible for registration on Form S-8 and shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement thereafter for so long as any of such options or other rights remain outstanding. 

  

 5.12 _Nasdaq Listing_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to authorize for listing on Nasdaq the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those required to be reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance. 

  

 5.13 _Company Affiliates; Restrictive Legend_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 The Company will provide Parent with such information and documents as Parent reasonably requests for purposes of reviewing the list of Company Affiliates included in the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, as promptly as practicable on or following the date hereof, from each Company Affiliate an executed affiliate agreement pursuant to which such affiliate shall agree to be bound by the provisions of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act, in the form provided by Parent. Parent will give stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent with respect to any Parent Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger by any Company Affiliate and there will be placed on the certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance that the shares were issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act applies and may only be transferred (a) in conformity with Rule 145 or (b) in accordance with a written opinion of counsel, reasonably acceptable to Parent in form and substance, that such transfer is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. 

  

 5.14 _Treatment as Reorganization_. 

  

 (a) None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall, and they shall not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action (or fail to take any action) prior to or following the Closing that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization with the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

 (b) Parent, on its behalf and on behalf of Merger Sub, and the Company shall execute and deliver to each of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, counsel to Parent and Merger Sub ("WSGR"), and Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, counsel to the Company ("WGM"), certificates substantially in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibits B_ and _C_ at such time or times as reasonably requested by each such law firm in connection with its delivery of the tax opinions referred to in Section 6.1(f). 

   

 5.15 _Company Rights Plan_. The Company shall not redeem the Company Rights or amend or modify (including by delay of the "Distribution Date" thereunder) or terminate the Company Rights Plan prior to the Effective Time unless, and only to the extent that: (a) it is required to do so by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or (b) its Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of a Superior Offer with respect to it, the failure to effect such amendment, modification or termination would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 5.16 _Board of Directors_. The Board of Directors of Parent shall take all actions necessary such that effective as of immediately following the Effective Time, two members of the Board of Directors of the Company who are acceptable to Parent shall become members of the Board of Directors of Parent. 

  

 5.17 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to 

   ##### 

  

 

Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article
I of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, and the acquisition of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) by each individual who is or
will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the

16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   

 5.18 _Merger Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all of Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub shall not engage in any business which is not in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

At the Closing, the Company shall execute and deliver: (a) to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, as trustee ("Wells Fargo") under the Indenture, dated as of February 7, 2003, between the Company and Wells Fargo (the "Indenture") relating to the 2.25% Notes, a supplemental indenture effective as of the Closing complying with the requirements of Section 4.11 and Article 11 of the Indenture together with any related certificates, legal opinions and other documents required by the Indenture to be delivered in connection with the supplemental indenture, (b) to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee ("U.S. Bank") under the Indenture, dated as of February 20, 2002, between CNT and U.S. Bank relating to the 3.00% Notes (the "CNT Indenture," as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 1, 2005 among the Company, CNT and US Bank), a supplemental indenture effective as of the Closing which complies with Section 4.11 and Article 11 of the CNT Indenture together with any related certificates, legal opinions and other documents required by the CNT Indenture to be delivered in connection with the supplemental indenture, and (c) amendments to the confirmations relating the purchased call option (the "Purchased Calls") and the issued call options (the "Issued Calls") entered into contemporaneously with the Indenture, providing that the Purchased Calls and Issued Calls, respectively, shall survive the Closing and be exercisable into shares of Parent Common Stock, in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, in each case, to any and all counterparties to such confirmations; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to the Purchased Calls and the Issued Calls, (i) any discussions concerning the terms of such amendments with the "calculation agent" under such confirmations shall be led and controlled by the Parent ( _provided_ that the Company shall be entitled to participate in any such discussions), and (ii) in the event that the calculation agent expresses a desire to adjust the terms of the Purchased Calls and Issued Calls in a manner unsatisfactory to Parent, in its sole discretion, Parent shall be entitled to negotiate a termination of such confirmations with such counterparty, to be effective on or after the Closing.

 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_.

    ##### 

  

 

entity operates generally or the United States economy generally (except to
the extent such changes disproportionately affect such entity), (F) any
Effect resulting from changes affecting general worldwide economic or capital
market conditions (except to the extent such changes disproportionately
affect such entity), (G) any Effect resulting from (x) changes in
applicable Legal Requirements or (y) GAAP or formal pronouncements by
standards bodies related thereto, (H) acts of war or terrorism (except to the
extent such acts disproportionately affect such entity), (I) earthquakes,

 8.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following the Effective Time, in Section 5.10. 

  

 8.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 8.7 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other 

   ##### 

  

 

remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.

 (c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 8.8, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject mater hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

party drafting such agreement or document.

 8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
