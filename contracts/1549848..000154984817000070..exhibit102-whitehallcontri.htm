 (a) For each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31,
2018 (each such fiscal year, an "Earnout Period"), the Partnership shall
prepare and deliver to Proppants, within 90 days after the end of each such
fiscal year, a written notice specifying the calculation of Partnership
Adjusted EBITDA for such fiscal year (the "Partnership Adjusted EBITDA
Notice"). If Partnership Adjusted EBITDA for an Earnout Period is (i) less
than 85% of the amount set forth on Schedule A for such Earnout Period, then
Acquisition Co. shall have no obligation to pay Proppants any additional
amount with respect to such Earnout Period, (ii) 85% or more, but less than
the amount set forth on Schedule A for such Earnout Period, then Acquisition
Co. shall pay Proppants an additional $10.0 million with respect to the
Contribution Transactions in respect of such Earnout Period, or (iii) equal to
or in excess of the amount set forth on Schedule A for such Earnout Period,
then Acquisition Co. shall pay Proppants $20.0 million with respect to the
Contribution Transactions in respect of such Earnout Period. In addition, if
total Partnership Adjusted EBITDA for both of the fiscal years ending December
31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, in the aggregate, equals or exceeds the
combined amount set forth on Schedule A for both such fiscal years, then
Acquisition Co. shall pay Proppants an additional $25.0 million with respect
to the Contribution Transactions in respect of such two fiscal year period.
All payments hereunder shall be made in cash or in Common Units, at the
election of the Partnership, within 30 days after the final determination of
Partnership Adjusted EBITDA with respect to the applicable period as set forth
in this Section 2.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate amount of
additional payments under this Section 2.3 with respect to all periods shall
not exceed $65.0 million. If the Partnership sells all or substantially all of
its assets to a third party, or if a third party acquires all of the
outstanding Common Units of the Partnership, then the financial metrics set
forth in this Section 2.3 shall be deemed to have been satisfied at the
maximum amount provided herein and Proppants shall be entitled to receive a
payment (in cash or in Common Units, at the election of the Partnership) equal
to $65.0 million less the sum of all previous payments to Proppants under this
Section 2.3.

(b) If Proppants objects to the calculation of Partnership Adjusted EBITDA
with respect to an Earnout Period as set forth in the Partnership Adjusted
EBITDA Notice, then Proppants shall provide the Partnership with written
notice of same (which notice shall contain a reasonably detailed explanation
of the basis for such objection) (such notice, an "Objection Notice") within
30 days after the receipt of the Partnership Adjusted EBITDA Notice. If
Proppants fails to object to the calculation of Partnership Adjusted EBITDA
with respect to an Earnout Period as set forth in the Partnership Adjusted
EBITDA Notice within such 30 days period, then Proppants shall be deemed to
have agreed with and accepted the Partnership's calculation of Partnership
Adjusted EBITDA with respect to such Earnout Period for all purposes of this
Agreement. If Proppants timely provides an Objection Notice as contemplated by
this Section 2.3(b), then, for a period of 30 days after the Partnership's
receipt of such Objection Notice (the "Dispute Resolution Period"), the
Partnership shall (i) provide Proppants with reasonable access to the books,
records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents),
supporting data, facilities and employees of the Partnership for purposes of
evaluating the calculation of Partnership Adjusted EBITDA and (ii) reasonably
cooperate with Proppants and its representatives in connection with such
review, including providing on a timely basis all other information reasonably
necessary or useful in connection with the review of the calculation of
Partnership Adjusted EBITDA.







13

 (c) If Proppants provides an Objection Notice in accordance with Section
2.3(b) and the Partnership and Proppants cannot agree on the calculation of
Partnership Adjusted EBITDA during the Dispute Resolution Period, then the
Partnership and Proppants will submit their respective calculations of the
items in dispute (including any adjustments the parties wish to make as a
result of negotiations up to the date of such submission) to an accounting
firm of national standing agreed to by the Partnership and Proppants (the
"Accountant"). The Accountant will review each party's calculations, and with
respect to each disputed item, make a selection as to which of the disputed
items presented to it is, in the aggregate, more accurate (selecting one of
such items without interpolation or adjustment). The decision of the
Accountant will be made within 20 days after being engaged, or as soon
thereafter as reasonably practicable, and will be final and binding on the
parties hereto. The costs and expenses of the Accountant will be split evenly
by the Partnership and Proppants. Each of the Partnership and Proppants will
make available to the Accountant all reasonably relevant books and records
relating to the calculations submitted and all other information reasonably
requested by the Accountant for purposes of evaluating the calculation of

purposes for which it is presently being used is permitted under applicable
zoning Laws and applicable regulations of, and agreements with, Governmental

premiums due thereon have been paid, and Whitehall or PDQ is otherwise in
compliance in all material respects with the terms and provisions of such
policies. Each of Whitehall and PDQ is not in default under any of the
insurance policies set forth on Schedule 4.14 (or required to be set forth on

default thereunder. Schedule 4.14 also sets forth a list of all pending claims

from any and all Taxes which arise as a result of the ownership of the

than the earlier of (i) 45 days after receipt of notice from the Tax Authority
of such claim or (ii) 15 days prior to the date required for the filing of any
protest of such claim, notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such
fact.

of the affairs of Whitehall, PDQ and Augusta, respectively) shall control all
decisions with respect to any Tax Proceeding involving an Indemnified Tax

settlement with respect to such Tax Proceeding or the prosecution of such Tax
Proceeding to a determination in a court or other tribunal of initial or
appellate jurisdiction) in connection with a Tax Proceeding involving an
Indemnified Tax Claim as the Tax Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request
in writing from time to time, including the selection of counsel and experts
and the execution of powers of attorney; provided, however, that (i) within 30
days after the notice required by Section 8.3(b) has been delivered (or such
earlier date that any payment of Taxes with respect to such claim is due but
in no event sooner than five days after the Tax Indemnifying Party's receipt
of such notice), the Tax Indemnifying Party requests that such claim be
contested, and (ii) if the Tax Indemnified Party is requested by the Tax
Indemnifying Party to pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall have advanced to the Tax Indemnified Party, on an
interest-free basis, the amount of such claim. The Tax Indemnified Party shall
not make any payment of an Indemnified Tax Claim for at least 30 days (or such
shorter period as may be required by Law) after the giving of the notice
required by Section 8.3(b) with respect to such claim, shall give to the Tax
Indemnifying Party any information requested related to such claim, and
otherwise shall cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in order to contest

harmless the Partnership, the Partnership's Subsidiaries, including
Acquisition Co. and their respective Representatives (the "Partnership

Section 10.3 Indemnification Procedures. Claims for indemnification under this
Agreement (other than claims involving a Tax Proceeding, the procedures for
which are set forth in ARTICLE VIII) shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:

(a) Any Partnership Indemnified Party or Proppants Indemnified Party claiming
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") with respect to
any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party ("Third
Party Claim") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification
under Section 10.2 shall promptly (i) notify the Party providing the
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") of the Third Party Claim
and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice ("Claim Notice")
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim and a copy
of all papers served with respect to such claim (if any). Failure to timely
provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified
Party's indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is prejudiced by such delay or omission.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third Party Claim (unless (i) such Third Party Claim is
asserted against the Indemnifying Party also and the Indemnified Party
determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or
(ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such Third Party Claim
and provide indemnification with respect to any Losses arising from Third
Party Claim). If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party
Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a
final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this Section 10.3(b) and, after notice from the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as it diligently
conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE X
for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such Third Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim,
other than reasonable costs of investigation. The Indemnifying Party shall
have full control of such defense



32

 and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement
agreement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided,
further, that such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement
agreement contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third
party asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim,
(ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any sanction or restriction
upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates,
(iii) there is no finding or admission of any violation of applicable Law or
any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other Third
Party Claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, (iv) the sole
relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party and (v) the Indemnified Party will have no liability with respect to any
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claims. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim against
the Person asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross complaint against any
Person. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense
or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 10.3(b), and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own
costs and expenses with respect to such participation.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
10.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be
reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified
Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by
the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may not
enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if
indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Party's
consent. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Section 10.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation.

(d) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE X, a claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be
asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought.

(e) The Parties hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court
in which a Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party for purposes of
any Claim that an Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement with
respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein, and agree that
process may be served on any Party with respect to such a claim anywhere in
the world.







33

 (f) The Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall
furnish such information (so long as such information is not subject to any
confidentiality agreements or attorney-client privilege; provided, that the
parties shall take all reasonable measures to fully provide such information
in compliance with such obligations) in reasonable detail as it may have with
respect to a Third Party Claim (including copies of any summons, complaint or
other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) to the
other party if such other party is assuming defense of such Third Party Claim,
and make available all records and other similar materials which are
reasonably required in the defense of such Third Party Claim and shall
otherwise reasonably cooperate with and assist the defending party in the
defense of such Third Party Claim.

(g) With respect to any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this ARTICLE X: (i) both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, as
the case may be, shall keep the other Person reasonably informed of the status
of such Third Party Claims and any related judicial or other proceedings at
all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel and
(ii) the parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in
good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any Third Party Claim.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.3, the
indemnification procedures set forth in ARTICLE VIII shall control any
indemnities relating to Taxes.

Section 10.4 Additional Agreements Regarding Indemnification. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein and subject to ARTICLE VIII relating to Taxes:

Partnership Indemnified Parties thereunder exceed $1,400,000 (the "Basket"),

and the Partnership Fundamental Representations and Warranties) exceed the Cap
and (ii) the joint and several aggregate liability of Acquisition Co. and the
Partnership arising out of or relating to Section 10.2(b) for breaches of the

(f) for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 10.4 shall affect the
provisions of ARTICLE VIII.

(g) for purposes of determining whether a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement (other than the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.5) has occurred and whether any Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification for any liabilities under this ARTICLE X
arising from any such breach of such representation or warranty and in
calculating the amount of such liabilities, the Parties shall disregard (i)
any requirement in any such representation or warranty that an event or fact
be material, have, or be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect, or otherwise be subject to a similar qualification as to materiality,
material adverse effect or words of similar import and (ii) any other
references to materiality, material adverse effect or words of similar import

or acknowledgment by Proppants, in and of itself, that such information is
material to or outside the ordinary course of the Business of each of the
Contributed Entities or required to be disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule.

Section 12.8 Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or

rules of any stock or commodities exchange after consultation with the other
Party as is reasonable under the circumstances.

Section 12.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid

Parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, then they shall take any actions necessary to render the
remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise
modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held
invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect
to the intent of the Parties to the greatest extent legally permissible.

out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties further agree that the
Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court or jurisdiction

immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each such party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in Section 12.11(b).
