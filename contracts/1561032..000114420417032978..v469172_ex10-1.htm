give prompt written notice to Seller, to the extent either such party
becomes aware of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, or reasonable

4.3_ to provide Purchaser or its Representatives with access to or to disclose
information (w) relating to the consideration, negotiation and performance of
this Agreement and related agreements, (x) to the extent such information is
subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party

Section 4.6 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Seller Parent
Stockholder Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Date, Seller
Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") a proxy statement with respect to the Seller Parent
Stockholder Meeting in connection with the transactions proposed herein as
well as the liquidation and dissolution of the Seller Parent (the "Proxy
Statement") in preliminary form. Purchaser Parent shall furnish all
information concerning itself, its Affiliates and its management and
provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The
Proxy Statement shall include all information, in respect to Purchaser and
Purchaser Parent, reasonably requested by Purchaser Parent to be included
therein. Seller Parent shall promptly notify Purchaser Parent upon the receipt
of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof, provide Purchaser Parent with copies of all
correspondence between Seller Parent and its Representatives, on one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect
to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and promptly advise Purchaser
Parent of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from
the SEC. Seller Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the
Proxy Statement (including with respect to the preliminary proxy statement),
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Seller Parent
shall cooperate and provide Purchaser Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final
version of such document or response) and shall give due consideration to
all changes provided by Purchaser Parent.

  



  

(b) None of the information supplied or to be supplied in writing by
or on behalf of Seller Parent or any its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy
Statement is first mailed to the shareholders of Seller Parent, at any time
it is amended or supplemented or at the time of the Seller Parent Stockholder
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made,
not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of Purchaser Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion in any of
the filings made or to be made by Seller Parent or its Affiliates with the
SEC or with any stock exchange of or other regulatory authority will, at the
time filed with the SEC, any stock exchange or other regulatory authority,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading. All documents that Seller Parent is responsible for filing with
the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, to the
extent relating to Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or other
information supplied by or on behalf of Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for inclusion therein, will comply as to form, in all material
respects, with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder and each such document required to be filed with any governmental
entity (other than the SEC) will comply in all material respects with the
provisions of any applicable law as to the information required to be
contained therein.

  



  

(c) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Seller Parent
Stockholder Approval, any information relating to Seller Parent or
Purchaser Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates should be discovered
by Seller Parent or Purchaser Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of
Seller Parent or Purchaser Parent, as the case may be, should be set forth in
an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
Seller Parent or Purchaser Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with
the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement
and, to the extent required by law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of Seller Parent.
Nothing in this _Section 4.6(c)_ shall limit the obligations of any party
under _Section 4.6(a)_. For purposes of _Section 6.30_ and this
_Section 4.6_ any information concerning or related to Seller Parent, its
Affiliates or the Seller Parent Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have
been provided by Seller Parent, and any information concerning or related to
Purchaser Parent or its Affiliates (including with respect to their
properties, management or businesses) will be deemed to have been provided by
Purchaser Parent.

(d) Seller Parent shall take all steps to hold the Seller Parent
Stockholder Meeting within a reasonable time after it has cleared or
resolved any comments, if any, received from the SEC and shall, in accordance
with applicable law and the Seller Parent Organizational Documents, establish
a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (including any adjournments or postponements thereof, the
"Seller Parent Stockholder Meeting"). Seller Parent shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of Seller Parent
entitled to vote at the Seller Parent Stockholder Meeting as soon as
practicable after it has cleared or resolved any comments, if any, received
from the SEC. Seller Parent shall, through the Seller Parent Board, recommend
to its stockholders that they give the Seller Parent Stockholder Approval,
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement (the "Seller Parent
Recommendation") and solicit and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the Seller Parent Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the
Seller Parent Board shall have made a Seller Parent Change in Recommendation
as permitted by _Section 4.7_. Seller Parent shall keep Purchaser Parent
updated on a periodic basis with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested by the Purchaser Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 4.6(d)_ , if, on a date for which the Seller
Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, Seller Parent has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares to obtain the Seller
Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Seller Parent
shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Seller Parent Stockholder Meeting, provided, however,
that the Seller Parent Stockholder Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned
to a date that is more than 120 days after the record date for the Seller
Parent Stockholder Meeting.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Exclusivity_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof through the Closing Date or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE 9_ , except as
permitted by, and subject to, _Section 4.7(c)_ , _Section 4.7(d)_ , _Section
4.7(e)_ and _Section 4.8_ , Seller Parent shall not, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Representatives to, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal, offer or other action that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any person, or furnish to any person other
than Seller Parent any non-public information, in furtherance of such
inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) release any person
from or fail to enforce any standstill agreement or similar obligation to
Seller Parent or any of the Subsidiaries of Seller Parent, (iv) withdraw,
modify or amend the Seller Parent Recommendation in any manner adverse to
Purchaser or fail to make the Seller Parent Recommendation or fail to include
the Seller Parent Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (v) approve, endorse
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (vi) enter into any agreement in
principle, arrangement, understanding, contract or agreement (whether
binding or not) relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (vii) take any action
to exempt any person from any Takeover Statute or similar restrictive
provision of the Seller Parent Organizational Documents for purposes of
facilitating an Acquisition Proposal (any event described in _clause (iv),_
_clause (v)_ , _clause (vi)_ or _clause (vii)_ , whether taken by the Seller
Parent Board or a committee thereof, a "Seller Parent Change in
Recommendation"). Seller Parent agrees that in the event any Representative
of Seller Parent or any Subsidiary of Seller Parent takes any action on behalf
of Seller Parent that, if taken by Seller Parent, would constitute a material
violation of this _Section 4.7(a)_ , then Seller Parent shall be deemed to be
in violation of this _Section 4.7(a)_ for all purposes of this Agreement.

---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Except as permitted by, and subject to, _Section 4.7(a)_ ,
_Section 4.7(c)_ , _Section 4.7(d)_ and _Section 4.7(e)_ , Seller Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or
communications with any person (other than Purchaser) with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and immediately
terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to
any such person (other than Purchaser).

  



  

(c) If prior to receipt of the Seller Parent Stockholder Approval,
Seller Parent, Seller, or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
which has not been initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in
violation of _Section 4.7(a)_ , and which the Seller Parent Special Committee
has determined in good faith following consultation with its legal and
financial advisors is or could be reasonably expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives thereafter may take the following actions: (i) furnish, make
available or provide access to non-public information with respect to Seller
Parent and its Subsidiaries to the person who made such Acquisition Proposal
and such person's Representatives (provided that Seller Parent (A) has
previously furnished, made available or provided access to such non-public
information to Purchaser and (B) furnishes, makes available or provides access
to such non-public information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in a
form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser), (ii) participate in negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) disclose to the stockholders
of Seller Parent any information required to be disclosed under applicable
law. In the event Seller Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives receives from a person or group of related persons
(x) an Acquisition Proposal or an amended or modified proposal or offer with
respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, (y) any request for information
relating to Seller Parent any or its Subsidiaries from a person who informs
Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making or has
made an Acquisition Proposal or (z) any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, Seller Parent shall promptly
notify Purchaser of (but in no event more than 48 hours following) such
receipt. Such notification shall include, to the extent then known, the
identity of the parties and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request or, if not made in writing, a written description of the material
terms thereof. Seller Parent shall keep Purchaser apprised on a current basis
of (and in any event no later than 24 hours after) any material developments,
discussions and negotiations concerning, any such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request, including by furnishing copies of any documentation and
written correspondence that supplements or amends any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the preceding three
sentences, nothing herein shall prohibit Seller Parent, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives from contacting in writing any person
submitting an Acquisition Proposal (that was not the result of a violation of
this _Section 4.7_ ) solely to clarify the terms of the Acquisition Proposal
for the sole purpose of the Seller Parent Board (or the Seller Parent Special
Committee) informing itself about such Acquisition Proposal. Neither Seller
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement,
enter into any confidentiality agreement that would prohibit it from providing
such information to Purchaser.

(d) At any time prior to receipt of the Seller Parent Stockholder
Approval, the Seller Parent Board may, if the Seller Parent Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its legal advisor (and based
on the recommendation of the Seller Parent Special Committee) that the
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
standard of conduct applicable to Seller Parent's directors under applicable
law,

  



  

(i) upon receipt by Seller Parent of an Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, make a Seller Parent Change in
Recommendation (and Seller Parent may so terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1(e)_ of this Agreement and enter into
an agreement relating to, or for the implementation of, such Superior
Proposal); or

  



  

(ii) otherwise make a Seller Parent Change in Recommendation in
response to a Seller Parent Intervening Event in circumstances not involving
an Acquisition Proposal; provided that:

  



   | (A)| in the case of a Seller Parent Change in Recommendation under
_clause (i)_ of this _Section 4.7(d)_ , (1) such Acquisition Proposal did
not result from Seller Parent's breach of its obligations under this
_Section 4.7_ , and (2) the Seller Parent Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its legal and financial advisors (and based on the
recommendation of the Seller Parent Special Committee), that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with its
legal advisor, that the failure of Seller Parent to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 9.1(e)_ or make a Seller Parent Change in
Recommendation, as the case may be, would be inconsistent with
directors' duties under applicable law, taking into account all adjustments
to the terms of this Agreement that have been offered by Purchaser pursuant
to _Section 4.7(d)(ii)(D)_ ; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (B)| in the case of a Seller Parent Change in Recommendation under
clause (ii) of this _Section 4.7(d)_ , the Seller Parent Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisor (and based on the
recommendation of the Seller Parent Special Committee), that failure of
Seller Parent to make a Seller Parent Change in Recommendation would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the standard of conduct
applicable to Seller Parent's directors under applicable law, taking into
account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that have been offered
by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 4.7(d)(ii)(D)_ ; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 22 
---|--- 

 



    



   | (C)| Seller Parent has notified Purchaser in writing that the Seller
Parent Board intends to make a Seller Parent Change in Recommendation or
enter into an agreement related to the Superior Proposal, attaching the most
current version of such agreement (including any amendments, supplements or
modifications) to such notice (a "Seller Parent Change Notice"); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (D)| during the three (3) Business Day period following Purchaser's
receipt of a Seller Parent Change Notice, Seller Parent shall have offered to
negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and
shall have caused its respective financial and legal advisors to offer to
negotiate with (and, if accepted, negotiate in good faith with), Purchaser in
making adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that (1)
in circumstances involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Superior Proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal; provided that any
amendment, supplement or modification to any Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed a new Acquisition Proposal and Seller Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or make a Seller Parent Change in
Recommendation pursuant to _clause (i)_ of this _Section 4.7(d)_ unless
Seller Parent has complied with the requirements of this _Section 4.7(d)_ with
respect to each such new Acquisition Proposal including sending a Seller
Parent Change Notice with respect to each such new Acquisition Proposal
(except that the new negotiation period under this _Section 4.7(d)(ii)(D)_
shall be two (2) business days instead of three (3) business days), and (2)
in circumstances not involving an Acquisition Proposal, as may be proposed by
Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(e) Nothing in this _Section 4.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prevent the Seller Parent Board or Seller Parent, directly or
indirectly, from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Seller
Parent a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
making any required disclosure to the stockholders of the Seller Parent under
applicable law, including Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of Seller Parent if the Seller Parent Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its legal advisors (and based on the
recommendation of the Seller Parent Special Committee) that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with directors' duties under applicable law;
provided, however, that a Seller Parent Change in Recommendation may only be
effected in accordance with _Section 4.7(d)_.

Section 4.8 _Consents; Cooperation_. Each of Seller Parent and
Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing to
obtain all consents that may be required from third parties with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Purchaser shall cooperate
therewith. Each of Seller Parent and Seller will use its commercially
reasonable efforts prior to the Closing to obtain all estoppel certificates
from Tenants in accordance with their respective Leases and the lessors in
accordance with their respective Ground Leases and from any other person
identified on _Schedule 4.8_. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in
preparing and sending a notice to the Illinois Department of Public Health
upon Closing in connection with Cedarhurst TRS Facility Master Tenant's
license for the operation of the Cedarhurst Facility and its continued
operation of the Business following the Closing. Seller shall provide
reasonable cooperation and assistance to Purchaser in confirming or obtaining
any licenses and permits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party will
be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any liability or
obligation to) a person from whom or which a consent may be required (other
than payment by Seller of past due amounts under contracts or Leases or past
due taxes, or payment by Purchaser of any fees or other costs imposed by
governmental authorities with respect to licenses and permits, or transfer
fees, if any, required by the express terms of any Material Contract) or
otherwise enter into or modify any agreement with such person that involves
any cost, liability or obligation.

  



  

Section 4.9 _Further Assurances_. Each party covenants and agrees
that, following the Closing, it will execute, deliver and acknowledge (or
cause to be executed, delivered and acknowledged), from time to time, at the
reasonable request of the other party and without further consideration, all
such further instruments as may be reasonable acceptable to such party and
take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
transfer more effectively to Purchaser, or to perfect or record
Purchaser's interest in the Companies or to enable Purchaser to use or
otherwise to confirm or carry out the provisions and intent of
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.10 _Updates to Schedules_. Any fact or item disclosed on
any Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed disclosed with regard to all
other representations and warranties to which such fact or item may
reasonably apply to the extent such disclosure would provide notice to a
reasonable person that the information disclosed would also qualify, or
constitute an exception to, such other representations and warranties. Seller
may from time to time supplement and update such Schedules to reflect any
changes since the date of delivery of the original Schedules or any matters
of which Seller's Knowledge was first acquired following the original
delivery date of such Schedules. Any such updates or supplements shall be
deemed to amend the Schedules for all purposes retroactively to the Effective
Date, except that (i) no amendment to _Schedule 1.1(d)_ may be made without
Purchaser's written consent, and (ii) any amendments permitted above shall be
disregarded (x) in determining if the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section 5.3(d)_ have been satisfied, and (y) for all
purposes under this Agreement if Seller intentionally omitted such
information from the original Schedules.

Section 4.11 _Liens_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller covenants and agrees that at or prior to Closing, Seller shall (i) pay
in full and cause to be canceled and discharged or otherwise bond and
discharge as liens against the Real Property all mechanics' materialmen's,
repairmen's, contractors' or other similar Liens which encumber the Real
Property as of the date hereof created by, through or under Seller or which
may be filed against the Real Property after the date hereof created by,
through or under Seller and on or prior to the Closing Date (ii) pay in full
all past due ad valorem taxes and assessments of any kind constituting a lien
against the Real Property which are due and payable, and (iii) except for the
Philip Center Loan (which Purchaser shall assume in accordance with _Section
4.12_ ), pay in full or cause to be canceled and discharged all security
deeds or other security instruments encumbering the Real Property and all
judgments which have attached to and become a lien against the Real Property
by, through or under Seller. In the event Seller fails to cause such liens
and Encumbrances to be paid and canceled at or prior to Closing, Purchaser
shall be entitled to pay such reasonable amount to the holder thereof as may
be required to pay and cancel same, and to credit against the Purchase Price
the amount so paid.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.11_ (as disclosed by Seller),
Seller has not granted any license, lease, easement or other right relating
to the use or possession of the Real Property (except (i) under the Leases,
the Residency Agreements and the Cedarhurst Management Agreement existing as
of the Effective Date and entered into by Seller in the ordinary course of
business in accordance with _Section 4.1_ hereof; or (ii) as may be a
Permitted Encumbrance), and Seller agrees that, other than as expressly
permitted by _Section 4.1_ hereof, it shall not grant any such right prior to
Closing without the prior written approval of Purchaser, which may be
withheld in Purchaser's sole and absolute discretion.

  



  

Section 4.12 _Purchaser Assumption of Philip Center Loan_. Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assume the Philip Center Loan
upon terms that are substantially similar to the Philip Center Consent and
Assumption Agreement, including, but not limited to Purchaser Parent
providing a guaranty substantially similar to the Philip Center Guaranty and
entering into an Environmental Indemnity Agreement, providing all financial

notice has reason to believe may result in a claim by it for
indemnity pursuant to this Agreement, such person (the "Indemnified Party")
shall give notice of such action, proceeding or claim to the party against
whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party"), setting forth in
reasonable detail the nature of such action or claim, including copies of any
written correspondence from such third person to such Indemnified Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
assume and control such defense with counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party
and approved by the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in such defense after such assumption at the Indemnified Party's
own expense. Upon assuming such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have
full rights to enter into any monetary compromise or settlement which is
dispositive of the matters involved; provided that such settlement is paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party and will not have any continuing material
adverse effect upon the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(c) With respect to any action, proceeding or claim as to which the
Indemnifying Party shall not have exercised its right to assume the defense,
the Indemnified Party may assume and control the defense of and contest such
action, proceeding or claim with counsel chosen by it. The Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action, the cost of
such participation to be at its own expense. The Indemnifying Party shall be
obligated to pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the
Indemnified Party to the extent that such fees and expenses relate to claims
as to which indemnification is due under _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_
hereof, as the case may be. The Indemnified Party shall have full rights to
dispose of such action and enter into any monetary compromise or settlement;
__provided__ , __however__ , in the event that the Indemnified Party shall
settle or compromise any claims involved in the action insofar as they relate
to, or arise out of, the same facts as gave rise to any claim for which
indemnification is due under _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ hereof, as the
case may be, it shall act reasonably and in good faith in doing so.

  



  

(d) Both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate fully with one another in connection with the defense,
compromise or settlement of any such claim, proceeding or action, including,
without limitation, by making available to the other all
pertinent information and witnesses within its control.

  



  

Section 8.5 _General Qualifications on Indemnification_.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the indemnification rights set
forth in  _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ shall be subject to the following:

  



  

(a) The liability of an Indemnifying Party with respect to any
indemnification claim shall be reduced by the amount of any tax
benefit actually realized or any insurance proceeds received by Indemnified
Party as a result of any damages, upon which such claim is based, and shall
be increased by the amount of any tax detriment actually suffered by the
Indemnified Party as a result of such damages. The amount of such tax benefit
or detriment shall be determined by taking into account the effect, if any,
and to the extent determinable, of timing differences resulting from the
acceleration or deferral of items of gain or loss resulting from such
damages.

  



  

(b) Damages shall include actual damages and shall not include any
special, punitive, multiplied or consequential damages, or lost
profits, except to the extent the same are included in a third-party judgment
against the Indemnified Party.

  



  

   

 | 44 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Upon payment in full of any indemnification claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to the
rights of the Indemnified Party against any person or entity with respect to
the subject matter of such indemnification claim.

  



  

(d) An Indemnified Party may not recover for any losses otherwise
indemnifiable under _Section 8.1(a)_ , _Section 8.1(b)_ , _Section 8.2(a)_ or
_Section 8.2(b)_ if such Indemnified Party or its Advisor (or such Advisor's
executive officers) had actual (and not merely imputed) knowledge prior to
Closing of the breach, inaccuracy or failure giving rise to such losses.

  



  

(e) An Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its duty to indemnify
an Indemnified Party hereunder if and to the extent the Indemnified Party
fails to use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to mitigate its
damages, including, but not limited to, failure to give timely notice to its
insurance carriers and to pursue recovery under applicable policies of
insurance.

  



  

(f) Except in the case of fraud, any losses payable to Purchaser or
Purchaser Parent shall be satisfied (i) from the Escrow Amount and (ii) to
the extent the amount of losses exceeds the Escrow Amount, from Seller Parent
and Seller jointly and severally.

  



  

Section 8.6 _Effective Upon Closing_. The provisions of this
_ARTICLE 8_ shall become effective upon completion of the Closing, and shall
have no force and effect prior to the Closing or if this Agreement is
terminated prior to Closing.

  



  

ARTICLE 9

  

Termination

  



  

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be terminated at any time prior to Closing as follows:

  



  

(a) by mutual agreement of Seller Parent and Purchaser Parent;

  



  

(b) by Purchaser Parent, as and to the extent permitted pursuant to
_Section 5.6(b)_ ;

  



  

(c) by Purchaser Parent, (i) if, at any time prior to the Seller
Parent Stockholder Approval, the Seller Parent Board or any
committee thereof, for any reason, shall have effected a Seller Parent Change
in Recommendation; or (ii) if, at any time prior to the Seller Parent
Stockholder Approval, (A) the Seller Parent Board or any committee thereof
shall have approved, adopted or publicly endorsed or recommended any
Acquisition Proposal, (B) the Seller Parent enters into a contract or
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement entered into in compliance with _Section 4.7(c)_ ), (C) a tender
offer or exchange offer for any outstanding Seller Parent Common Stock that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (other than by Purchaser or any of its

against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders
of Seller Parent and to publicly reaffirm the Seller Parent Recommendation
within ten (10) Business Days of being requested to do so by Purchaser, (D)
the Seller Parent Board or any committee thereof fails to include the Seller
Parent Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or (E) Seller Parent shall have
materially violated any of its obligations under _Section 4.7_ (or shall be
deemed pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 4.7(a)_ to have materially
violated) any of its obligations under _Section 4.7_ (other than any
immaterial or inadvertent violations thereof that did not result in an
alternative Acquisition Proposal); in which case, Seller Parent shall pay,
within three (3) Business Days of such termination, to Purchaser the
Termination Fee in immediately available funds to an account directed by
Purchaser;

  



  

   

 | 45 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) by Seller Parent, as and to the extent permitted pursuant to
_Section 5.6(a)_ ;

  



  

(e) by either Purchaser Parent or Seller Parent, if either (i) the
Seller Parent Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a duly
held Seller Parent Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof) at which the transactions contemplated hereby have been
voted upon or (ii) the Seller Parent Stockholder Approval otherwise is not
obtained within 120 days after the record date for the Seller Parent
Stockholder Meeting;

  



  

(f) by Seller Parent, if, prior to obtaining the Seller Parent
Stockholder Approval, the Seller Parent Board (based on the recommendation of
the Seller Parent Special Committee) approves and authorizes Seller Parent to
enter into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a
Superior Proposal in a manner permitted under _Section 4.7(d)_ ); provided,
however, that this Agreement may not be so terminated unless concurrently
with the occurrence of such termination Seller Parent pays the Termination Fee
in full to Purchaser and the definitive agreement relating to the Superior
Proposal is entered into, and in the event that such definitive agreement is
not concurrently entered into and such payment is not concurrently made, such
termination shall be null and void;

  



  

(g) if a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental
agency shall have issued an order, decree, or ruling or taken any
other action (which order, decree or ruling the parties hereto shall use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to lift), in each case permanently
restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling, or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable;

  



  

(h) by either Purchaser Parent or Seller Parent if Closing shall not
have occurred on or before March 16, 2018; __provided_ , _however_ ,_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(h)_ shall
not be available to any party if the failure of such party (and (A) in the
case of Purchaser Parent, including the failure of Purchaser and their
Affiliates and (B) in the case of the Seller Parent, including the failure of
Seller and their Affiliates) to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement has been a principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
transactions to be consummated on or before such date.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. Upon termination of this
Agreement prior to Closing, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the
parties shall have no further liability hereunder except that the following
provisions shall survive any such termination: _Section 4.3_ and _Section

fee paid to KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., incurred by Purchaser in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; __provided_ , _however_

---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 9.3 _Payment of Termination Fee_.

  



  

(a) If the Seller Parent is required to pay to Purchaser Parent the
Termination Fee, such Termination Fee shall be paid into escrow on the date
such payment is required to be paid by Seller Parent pursuant to this
Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow
account designated in accordance with this Section 9.3. In the event that
Seller Parent is obligated to pay Purchaser the Termination Fee, the amount
payable to Purchaser in any tax year of Purchaser shall not exceed the lesser
of (i) the Termination Fee payable to Purchaser, and (ii) the sum of (A) the
maximum amount that can be paid to Purchaser without causing Purchaser to
fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the
relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code
("Qualifying Income") and Purchaser has One Million and No/100 U.S. Dollars
($1,000,000.00) of income from unknown sources during such year which is not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by Purchaser's independent
accountants, plus (B) in the event Purchaser receive either (x) a letter from
the Purchaser's counsel indicating that Purchaser has received a ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service as described below in Section 9.3(b) or (y) an
opinion from Purchaser's outside counsel as described below in Section
9.3(b), an amount equal to the excess of the Termination Fee less the amount
payable under clause (A) above.

  



  

(b) To secure Seller Parent's obligation to pay these amounts,
Seller Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by Seller Parent on such terms
(subject to this Section 9.3) as shall be mutually agreed upon by Seller
Parent, Purchaser and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of
the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall be made at the time
Seller Parent is obligated to pay Purchaser such amount pursuant to Section
9.1 by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination
Fee in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Purchaser
unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (A)
a letter from Purchaser's independent accountants indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Purchaser without causing
Purchaser to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute Qualifying Income and Purchaser has One Million and No/100 U.S.
Dollars ($1,000,000.00) of income from unknown sources during such year which
is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which
is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such
amount to Purchaser, or (B) a letter from Purchaser's counsel indicating that
(x) Purchaser received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service holding
that the receipt by Purchaser of the Termination Fee would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (y) Purchaser's outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Purchaser of
the Termination Fee should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the
Termination Fee to Purchaser. Seller Parent agrees to amend this Section 9.3
at the reasonable request of Purchaser in order to (1) maximize the portion of
the Termination Fee that may be distributed to Purchasers hereunder without
causing Purchaser to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code, or (2) assist Purchaser in obtaining a favorable ruling or
legal opinion from its outside counsel, in each case, as described in this
Section 9.3. Any amount of the Termination Fee that remains unpaid as of the
end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following
taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this Section 9.3.

(a) Except to the extent Maryland law may be mandatorily applicable
to transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or applicable to
conduct, decisions, and acts by the Seller Parent's directors, this Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws and case

purchased, _Section 4.3_ , _Section 4.4_ , and _ARTICLE 10_ of this Agreement
shall survive.

  



  

   

 | 50 
---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 10.11 _Eminent Domain; Condemnation_. If, prior to Closing,
any proceedings are instituted by any governmental authority that shall
relate to the proposed taking of all or any portion of any Real Property by
eminent domain or condemnation (or if all or any portion of any Real Property
is taken by eminent domain or deeded under threat of condemnation after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing), Seller shall promptly
notify Purchaser in writing after Seller's receipt of any notification (and
provide copies of any notices, Complaints, deeds and the like). Purchaser
shall thereafter have the right and option to elect not to purchase such Real
Property by giving written notice to Seller within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by Purchaser of the notice from Seller and the date of the Closing
shall be extended if necessary to afford Purchaser such full fifteen (15) day
period. If Purchaser timely elects not to purchase such Real Property, the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted by reducing the Purchase Price by the
portion of the Purchase Price that is allocated for such Real Property (as
any such amount is set forth on Schedule 3.4, and neither party hereto shall
have any obligations of any nature to the other hereunder or by reason hereof
in respect to such Real Property not being purchased except for those
obligations and liabilities that are expressly stated to survive termination
of this Agreement. If no such election is timely made, Purchaser shall be
deemed to have waived its rights under this _Section 10.11_ with respect to
such Real Property, except that, if the transaction contemplated hereby
closes, Purchaser shall be entitled to the proceeds and the right to
negotiate, settle and collect the proceeds of such condemnation award, and
Seller shall execute and deliver all documents reasonably requested of Seller
in order to effectuate this _Section 10.11_. If no election not to purchase
such Real Property is made (and Purchaser expressly waives its rights under
this _Section 10.11_ with respect to such Real Property), Purchaser shall
have the right to participate prior to the Closing in any discussions or
proceedings with any governmental authority relating to the proposed taking
of any portions of the Real Property. Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, Purchaser shall not have any right and option
under this _Section 10.11_ to elect not to purchase such Real Property if
such proceedings relate only to a road widening or other minor taking that
does not impact any leased or leasable premises, reduce any parking area, or
otherwise significantly decrease the actual or potential income stream from
such Real Property.

  



  

Section 10.12 _Risk of Loss_. Subject to the provisions of this
_Section 10.12_ , as among the parties to this Agreement and their
Affiliates, the Companies shall retain all risks and liability for loss,
damage, destruction or injury by fire, storm, accident or any other casualty
to the Real Property from all causes until the Closing has been consummated.
In the event of any such damage or destruction prior to Closing (a) with an
estimated repair cost of greater than Twenty-five Percent (25%) of the portion
of the Purchase Price that is allocated to such Real Property (as set forth
on Schedule 3.4) (the "Casualty Threshold"), or (b) that requires a legally
nonconforming Real Property to be rebuilt in accordance with current zoning
requirements, as reasonably determined by an engineer selected by Seller and
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, or (c) that affects the lobby, building-
wide systems, parking facilities or common areas or the continued operation
of the balance of the Real Property not damaged, or (d) gives rise to rent
abatement or termination rights of tenants under Leases covering more than
Twenty-five Percent (25%) (the "Percentage") of the leased rentable square
feet of the building, then Purchaser may elect to not purchase such Real
Property by providing notice given to Seller within fifteen (15) days after
Seller has given Purchaser notice that such damage occurred and whether any
of the circumstances described in clauses (a) through (d) has occurred, and
the Closing shall be extended if necessary to afford Purchaser such full
fifteen (15) day period. If Purchaser timely elects not to purchase such Real
Property, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase
Price that is allocated for such Real Property (as set forth on Schedule
3.4), and neither party hereto shall thereupon have any further obligation to
the other in respect to such Real Property not being purchased, except for
those obligations and liabilities that are expressly stated to survive
termination of this Agreement. If no such election is timely made, Purchaser
shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this _Section 10.12_ with
respect to such Real Property, except as set forth below. If, prior to the
Closing, there shall occur damage to the Real Property that does not
satisfy any of clauses (a) through (d) above, then Purchaser shall not have
the right under this _Section 10.12_ to not purchase such Real Property. If
Purchaser does not exercise its right to elect not to purchase any Real
Property, or if Purchaser does not have the right to elect not to purchase
any Real Property, with respect to any fire or casualty, then Seller shall
assign to Purchaser at the Closing, by written instrument in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, all claims against third
parties relating to such damage, including all of the insurance proceeds
payable on account of any such fire or casualty, and Purchaser shall be
entitled to receive the full amount of any proceeds of such insurance payable
on account of loss, damage, destruction or casualty after the date hereof.
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser any such proceeds actually paid prior to
Closing, and Seller Parent and Seller shall be liable for the payment to
Purchaser of all deductibles under applicable insurance policies (net of
reasonable expenses of Seller, including, but not limited to the costs of
emergency repairs and safeguarding the Real Property). The proceeds of any
rent interruption insurance, if any, shall be appropriately apportioned
between Purchaser and Seller. Seller Parent and Seller covenant to execute
such assignments, drafts and other instruments as may be required to
effectuate this  _Section 10.12_. If no election not to purchase such Real
Property is made (and Purchaser expressly waives its rights under this
_Section 10.12_ with respect to such Real Property), or if Purchaser does not
have the right to elect not to purchase under this _Section 10.12_ ,
Purchaser shall have the right to participate prior to the Closing in any
discussions or proceedings with any insurer or other third party relating to
any claims made with respect to damage affecting the Real Property.

Section 10.13 _Attorneys ' Fees_. In the event either party brings
an action to enforce or interpret any of the provisions of this Agreement, the
"prevailing party" in such action shall, in addition to any other recovery,
be entitled to its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses arising from such
action and any appeal or any bankruptcy action related thereto, whether or not
such matter proceeds to court. For purposes of this Agreement, " _prevailing
party_ " shall mean, in the case of a person asserting a claim, such person
is successful in obtaining substantially all of the relief sought, and in the
case of a person defending against or responding to a claim, such person is
successful in denying substantially all of the relief sought. This
_Section 10.13_ shall not apply to any action involving a claim not exceeding
Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 U.S. Dollars ($500,000.00).

  



  

Section 10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. The parties agree that no
party to this Agreement shall seek a jury trial in any lawsuit, proceeding,
counterclaim or other litigation based upon, or arising out of, this
Agreement or the dealings or the relationship between them.

  



  

Section 10.15 _Construction_. This Agreement shall not be construed
more strictly against one party than against the other merely by virtue of the
fact that it may have been prepared by counsel for one of the parties, it
being recognized that both Seller and Purchaser have contributed with the

C. The Parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is not a party to,

Agreement.

  



  

In consideration of the promises and agreements of the Parties and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Parties and the Escrow Agent agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE 1 
 ESCROW DEPOSIT

  



  

Section 1.1. _Receipt of Escrow Property_. Following execution
hereof Purchaser Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the amount of
$6,000,000 (the "Escrow Property") in immediately available funds.

  



  

Section 1.2. _Investments_.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to deposit,
transfer, hold and invest the Escrow Property and any investment income
thereon as set forth in Exhibit A hereto or as set forth in any subsequent
written instruction signed by the Parties. Any investment earnings and income
on the Escrow Property shall become part of the Escrow Property, and shall be
disbursed in accordance with Section 1.3 or Section 1.6 of this Escrow
Agreement.

  



    



 



    



  

(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or
redeem any such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or
distributions required under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
have no responsibility or liability for any loss which may result from any
investment or sale of investment made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment
permitted by this Escrow Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual
capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or any such
affiliate is acting as agent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or
dealing as principal for its own account. The Parties acknowledge that the
Escrow Agent is not providing investment supervision, recommendations, or
advice.

  



  

(c) The Parties agree that confirmations of permitted investments
are not required to be issued by the Escrow Agent for each month in which a
monthly statement is rendered. No statement need be rendered for any fund or
account if no activity occurred in such fund or account during such month.
The Parties may obtain confirmations at no additional cost upon its written
request.

  



  

Section 1.3. _Disbursements_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser Parent and Seller Parent may at any time jointly
deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions (a "Joint
Instruction") directing the Escrow Agent to distribute all or a portion of
the Escrow Property. Within two Business Days after the date on which the
Escrow Agent receives such Joint Instruction, the Escrow Agent shall disburse
the amount set forth in the Joint Instruction to the Purchaser Parent or
Seller Parent to the accounts designated in such Joint Instruction.

  



  

(b) In the event and to the extent that Purchaser Parent determines
that it or Purchaser is entitled to any amount pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement, Purchaser Parent may, at any time on or prior to 11:59
p.m. Eastern Time on _________, 20__1 (the "Claims End Date"), deliver a
certificate or certificates to the Escrow Agent and Seller Parent (each a
"Purchaser Release Certificate") requesting that the Escrow Agent distribute
all or a portion of the Escrow Property to Purchaser Parent or a third-party
designated by Purchaser Parent, as the case may be, in satisfaction of such
claim (the "Distribution Request Amount"). If, within thirty (30) calendar
days after the date on which the Escrow Agent and Seller Parent receive such
Purchaser Release Certificate (the "Review Period"), Purchaser Parent and the
Escrow Agent have not received from Seller Parent a written certificate
objecting to one or more of the matters described in the Purchaser Release
Certificate (the "Objection Notice"), then, on the Business Day following the
last day of the Review Period, the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Purchaser
Parent (or a third party designated by Purchaser Parent) the
Distribution Request Amount. If an Objection Notice is delivered within the
Review Period, then the matters set forth in the Objection Notice shall be
considered in dispute by Seller Parent (a "Disputed Claim"), in which case (i)
the Escrow Agent shall retain those amounts set forth in the Purchaser
Release Certificate that are in dispute pursuant to the Objection Notice
(the "Disputed Amounts") until the Escrow Agent receives either (A) a Joint
Instruction authorizing the release to Purchaser Parent of the portion of the
Disputed Amounts that is agreed upon as the amount recoverable in respect of
the Disputed Claim, or (B) a Judgment directing the release to Purchaser
Parent of the portion of the Disputed Amounts that is determined to be
the amount recoverable in respect of the Disputed Claim, in which event the
Escrow Agent shall disburse the Disputed Amounts in accordance with such
Joint Instruction or Judgment, and (ii) the Escrow Agent shall disburse to
Purchaser Parent (or a third party designated by Purchaser Parent) those
amounts set forth in the Purchaser Release Certificate that are not in dispute
pursuant to the Objection Notice (the "Undisputed Amounts") within three (3)
Business Days following the receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Objection
Notice.

  



  



  

  

1 Date to be 14 months after the Closing Date.

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) On the date that is six (6) months following the Effective Date
(the "First Distribution Date"), the Escrow Agent shall reserve and hold
aside the aggregate amount that would be necessary to satisfy any then pending
and unsatisfied claims specified in any Purchaser Release Certificate
delivered to the Escrow Agent and Seller Parent prior to the First
Distribution Date from Purchaser Parent ("Initial Unresolved Claims") as if
such Initial Unresolved Claims were ultimately to be resolved in full favor
of Purchaser Parent or Purchaser (such reserved amount, the "Initial Reserved
Amount"). On the Initial Distribution Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute
to Seller Parent ( to Seller Parent's account as Seller Parent shall designate
in writing) thirty-three and one third percent (331/3%) of the balance of the
Escrow Property, after the Escrow Property has been reduced by the Initial
Reserved Amount. Within two (2) Business Days following resolution of any
Initial Unresolved Claim, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the portion of the
Initial Reserved Amount, if any, not required to satisfy any other remaining
Initial Unresolved Claims, to Seller Parent (to Seller Parent's account as
Seller Parent shall designate in writing).

  



  

(d) On the date that is twelve (12) months following the Effective
Date (the "Second Distribution Date"), the Escrow Agent shall reserve and
hold aside the aggregate amount that would be necessary to satisfy any then
pending and unsatisfied claims specified in any Purchaser Release Certificate
delivered to the Escrow Agent and Seller Parent prior to the Second
Distribution Date from Purchaser Parent ("Second Unresolved Claims") as if
such Second Unresolved Claims were ultimately to be resolved in full favor of
Purchaser Parent or Purchaser (such reserved amount, the "Second Reserved
Amount"). On the Second Distribution Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute
to Seller Parent (to Seller Parent's account as Seller Parent shall designate
in writing) thirty-three and one third percent (331/3%) of the balance of the
Escrow Property, after the Escrow Property has been reduced by the Initial
Reserved Amount. Within two (2) Business Days following resolution of any
Second Unresolved Claim, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the portion of the
Second Reserved Amount, if any, not required to satisfy any other remaining
Second Unresolved Claims, to Seller Parent (to Seller Parent's account as
Seller Parent shall designate in writing).

  



  

(e) Within five (5) Business Days following the Claims End Date, the
Escrow Agent shall disburse to Seller Parent (to Seller Parent's account as
Seller Parent shall designate in writing) an amount (the "Disbursement
Amount") equal to the remaining Escrow Property less amounts, if any, that
are (i) Disputed Amounts, (ii) subject to a pending Joint Instruction or
certified copy of a final non-appealable judgment or order of a court of
competent jurisdiction (a "Judgment") received by the Escrow Agent prior to
the Claims End Date but not yet paid by Escrow Agent, or (iii) subject to a
Purchaser Release Certificate delivered prior to the Claims End Date in
respect of which the Review Period has not expired. For the avoidance of
doubt, all Undisputed Amounts will be paid to Purchaser as provided in
Section 1.3(b) above.

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) After disbursement of the Disbursement Amount, the remaining
Escrow Property shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the following: (i) Seller
Parent and Purchaser Parent jointly directing the disbursement of such
remaining Escrow Property or any portion thereof by delivering a Joint
Instruction to the Escrow Agent or (ii) the Escrow Agent receiving a
certified copy of a Judgment awarding such remaining Escrow Property or any
portion thereof to Purchaser Parent or Seller Parent. Upon receipt of such
Joint Instruction or on the 5th Business Day after receipt of such
Judgment, the Escrow Agent shall disburse such remaining Escrow Property or
any portion thereof as required by such Joint Instruction or Judgment, as the
case may be.

  



  

Section 1.4. _Security Procedure For Funds Transfers_. The Escrow
Agent shall confirm each funds transfer instruction received in the name of a
Party by means of the security procedure selected by such Party and
communicated to the Escrow Agent through a signed certificate in the form of
Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 attached hereto, which upon receipt by the Escrow
Agent shall become a part of this Escrow Agreement. Once delivered to the
Escrow Agent, Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 may be revised or rescinded only by a
writing signed by an authorized representative of the Party. Such revisions
or rescissions shall be effective only after actual receipt and
following such period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent
a reasonable opportunity to act on it. If a revised Exhibit B-1 or B-2 or a
rescission of an existing Exhibit B-1 or B-2 is delivered to the Escrow Agent
by an entity that is a successor-in-interest to such Party, such document
shall be accompanied by additional documentation satisfactory to the Escrow
Agent showing that such entity has succeeded to the rights and
responsibilities of the Party under this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

The Parties understand that the Escrow Agent's inability to receive or
confirm funds transfer instructions pursuant to the security procedure
selected by such Party may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds
transfer, and agree that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss
caused by any such delay.

  



  

Section 1.5. _Income Tax Allocation and Reporting_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest
and other income from investment of the Escrow Property shall, as of the end
of each calendar year and to the extent required by the Internal Revenue
Service, be reported as having been earned by Seller Parent, whether or not
such income was disbursed during such calendar year.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) For certain payments made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, the
Escrow Agent may be required to make a "reportable payment" or "withholdable
payment" and in such cases the Escrow Agent shall have the duty to act as a
payor or withholding agent, respectively, that is responsible for any tax
withholding and reporting required under Chapters 3, 4, and 61 of the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Escrow
Agent shall have the sole right to make the determination as to which
payments are "reportable payments" or "withholdable payments." All parties
to this Escrow Agreement shall provide an executed IRS Form W-9 or
appropriate IRS Form W-8 (or, in each case, any successor form) to the Escrow
Agent prior to the date hereof, and shall promptly update any such form to the
extent such form becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect. The Escrow
Agent shall have the right to request from any party to this Escrow Agreement,
or any other person or entity entitled to payment hereunder, any additional
forms, documentation or other information as may be reasonably necessary for
the Escrow Agent to satisfy its reporting and withholding obligations under
the Code. To the extent any such forms to be delivered under this Section
1.5(b) are not provided prior to the date hereof or by the time the related
payment is required to be made or are determined by the Escrow Agent to be
incomplete and/or inaccurate in any respect, the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to withhold (without liability) a portion of any interest or other
income earned on the investment of the Escrow Property or on any such
payments hereunder to the extent withholding is required under Chapters 3, 4,
or 61 of the Code, and shall have no obligation to gross up any such payment.

  



  

(c) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the
payment of any taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of the
Escrow Property, the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such liability to the extent
possible from the Escrow Property. The Parties, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax,
late payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed
against the Escrow Agent on or with respect to the Escrow Property and
the investment thereof unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or
other expense was directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Escrow Agent. The indemnification provided by this Section
1.5(c) is in addition to the indemnification provided in Section 3.1 and
shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and the
termination of this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(d) The Parties hereto acknowledge that, in order to help fight the
funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all
financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies each person or corporation who opens an account and /or enters into
a business relationship. The Parties hereby agree that they shall provide the
Escrow Agent with such information as the Escrow Agent may request including,
but not limited to, each Party's name, physical address, tax identification
number and other information that will assist the Escrow Agent in identifying
and verifying each Party's identity such as organizational documents,
certificates of good standing, licenses to do business, or other pertinent
identifying information.

  



  

Section 1.6. _Termination_.  This Escrow Agreement shall terminate
upon the disbursement of all of the Escrow Property, including any interest
and investment earnings thereon, except that the provisions of Sections
1.5(c), 3.1 and 3.2 hereof shall survive termination and the Escrow Agent is
authorized and directed to disburse the Escrow Property in accordance with
Section 1.3 of this Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE 3 
 PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE ESCROW AGENT

  



  

Section 3.1. _Indemnification_. Seller Parent, and Purchaser Parent
shall jointly and severally , indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow
Agent from and against all loss, liability, cost, damage and expense,
including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses or
other professional fees and expenses which the Escrow Agent may suffer or
incur by reason of any action, claim or proceeding brought against the Escrow
Agent, arising out of or relating in any way to this Escrow Agreement or any
transaction to which this Escrow Agreement relates, unless such loss,
liability, cost, damage or expense shall have been finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the
Escrow Agent. The provisions of this Section 3.1 shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this
Escrow Agreement. As between Seller Parent, on the one hand and Purchaser
Parent, on the other hand, all costs of indemnification of the Escrow Agent
shall be born 50% by Seller Parent and 50% by the Purchaser Parent. If either
the Seller Parent or Purchaser Parent incurs greater than 50% of any such
costs of indemnification, the Seller Parent or Purchaser Parent, as
applicable, will promptly make payment to the other such that each of the
Seller Parent and Purchaser Parent has borne 50% of all amounts which are paid
to the Escrow Agent under this Section 3.1.

  



  

Section 3.2. _Limitation of Liability_. the escrow agent SHALL NOT
be liable, directly or indirectly, for any (i) damages, Losses or expenses
arising out of the services provided hereunder, other than damages, losses or
expenses which have been finally adjudicated to have DIRECTLY resulted from
the escrow agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (ii) special,
Indirect, PUNITIVE, or consequential damages or LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), even if the escrow agent has been
advised of the possibility of such LOSSES OR damages AND REGARDLESS OF THE
FORM OF ACTION.

  



  

Section 3.3. _Resignation or Removal_. The Escrow Agent may resign
by furnishing written notice of its resignation to the Parties, and the
Parties may remove the Escrow Agent by furnishing to the Escrow Agent a joint
written notice of its removal along with payment of all fees and expenses to
which the Escrow Agent is entitled through the date of removal. Such
resignation or removal, as the case may be, shall be effective thirty (30)
calendar days after the delivery of such notice or upon the earlier
appointment of a successor, and the Escrow Agent's sole responsibility
thereafter shall be to safely keep the Escrow Property and to deliver the
same to a successor escrow agent as shall be appointed by the Parties, as
evidenced by a joint written notice filed with the Escrow Agent or in
accordance with a court order. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) calendar days
following the delivery of such notice of resignation or removal, the Escrow
Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such
resulting appointment shall be binding upon the Parties.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 3.4. _Compensation_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
compensation for its services as stated in the fee schedule attached hereto as
Exhibit C, which compensation shall be paid 50% by Purchaser Parent and 50%
by Seller Parent. The fee agreed upon for the services rendered hereunder is
intended as full compensation for the Escrow Agent\'s services as contemplated
by this Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that the
conditions for the disbursement of funds under this Escrow Agreement are not
fulfilled, or the Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in this
Escrow Agreement, or there is any assignment of interest in the
subject matter of this Escrow Agreement, or any material modification hereof,
or if any material controversy arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent is made
a party to any litigation pertaining to this Escrow Agreement or the subject
matter hereof, then the Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such
extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, occasioned by any such delay,
controversy, litigation or event. If any amount due to the Escrow Agent
hereunder is not paid within thirty (30) calendar days of the date due, the
Escrow Agent in its sole discretion may charge interest on such amount up to
the highest rate permitted by applicable law. The Escrow Agent shall have, and
is hereby granted, a prior lien upon the Escrow Property with respect to its
unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights,
superior to the interests of any other persons or entities and is hereby
granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees, non-
reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights from the Escrow
Property.

  



  

Section 3.5. _Disagreements_. If any conflict, disagreement or
dispute arises between, among, or involving any of the parties hereto
concerning the meaning or validity of any provision hereunder or concerning
any other matter relating to this Escrow Agreement, or the Escrow Agent is
in doubt as to the action to be taken hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its
option, retain the Escrow Property until the Escrow Agent (i) receives a
Judgment directing delivery of the Escrow Property, (ii) receives a written
agreement executed by each of the parties involved in such disagreement or
dispute directing delivery of the Escrow Property, in which event the Escrow
Agent shall be authorized to disburse the Escrow Property in accordance with
such final court order, arbitration decision, or agreement, or (iii) files an
interpleader action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and upon the
filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all liability as to the
Escrow Property and shall be entitled to recover attorneys' fees, expenses
and other costs incurred in commencing and maintaining any such interpleader
action. Any such court order or arbitration decision shall be accompanied by
a written instrument of the presenting Party certifying that such court order
or arbitration decision is final, non-appealable and from a court of
competent jurisdiction or from a competent arbitration panel, upon which
instrument the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely without
further investigation. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act on any
such agreement, court order, or arbitration decision without further
question, inquiry, or consent.

association into which the Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with
which it may be consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or
substantially all of its corporate trust business and assets as a whole or

Agency and Custody Account Direction

  

For Cash Balances

  

Wells Fargo Money Market Deposit Accounts

  



  

Direction to use the following Wells Fargo Money Market Deposit Accounts for
Cash Balances for the escrow account or accounts (the "Account") established
under the Escrow Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached.

  



  

You are hereby directed to deposit, as indicated below, or as I shall direct
further in writing from time to time, all cash in the Account in the following
money market deposit account of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association:

  



  

Wells Fargo Money Market Deposit Account (MMDA)

  



  

I understand that amounts on deposit in the MMDA are insured, subject to the
applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC), in the basic FDIC insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor, per
insured bank. This includes principal and accrued interest up to a total
of $250,000.

  



  

I acknowledge that I have full power to direct investments of the Account.

  



  

I understand that I may change this direction at any time and that it shall
continue in effect until revoked or modified by me by written notice to you.

  



    



 



    



  

 _EXHIBIT B-1_

  



  

Purchaser Parent certifies that the names, titles, telephone numbers, e-mail
addresses and specimen signatures set forth in Parts I and II of this Exhibit
B-1 identify the persons authorized to provide direction and initiate or
confirm transactions, including funds transfer instructions, on behalf of
Purchaser Parent, and that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1
is the security procedure selected by Purchaser Parent for use in verifying
that a funds transfer instruction received by the Escrow Agent is that of
Purchaser Parent.

  



  

Purchaser Parent has reviewed each of the security procedures and has
determined that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1 best meets
its requirements; given the size, type and frequency of the instructions it
will issue to the Escrow Agent. By selecting the security procedure specified
in Part III of this Exhibit B-1, Purchaser Parent acknowledges that it has
elected to not use the other security procedures described and agrees to be
bound by any funds transfer instruction, whether or not authorized, issued in
its name and accepted by the Escrow Agent in compliance with the particular
security procedure chosen by Purchaser Parent.

  



  

 _NOTICE_ : The security procedure selected by Purchaser Parent will not be
used to detect errors in the funds transfer instructions given by Purchaser
Parent. If a funds transfer instruction describes the beneficiary of the
payment inconsistently by name and account number, payment may be made on the
basis of the account number even if it identifies a person different from the
named beneficiary. If a funds transfer instruction describes a participating
financial institution inconsistently by name and identification number, the
identification number may be relied upon as the proper identification of the
financial institution. Therefore, it is important that Purchaser Parent
take such steps as it deems prudent to ensure that there are no such
inconsistencies in the funds transfer instructions it sends to the Escrow
Agent.

Agent shall confirm funds transfer instructions by telephone call-back to a

---|---|--- 
   | ¨| CHECK box, if applicable: 
---|---|--- 
   | | If the Escrow Agent is unable to obtain confirmation by telephone
call-back, the Escrow Agent may, at its discretion, confirm by e-mail, as

   | ¨| _ _Option 2. Confirmation by e-mail__. The Escrow Agent shall
confirm funds transfer instructions by e-mail to a person at the e-mail
address specified for such person in Part II of this Exhibit B-1. The person
confirming the funds transfer instruction shall be a person other than the
person from whom the funds transfer instruction was received, unless only one
person is designated in both Parts I and II of this Exhibit B-1. Purchaser
Parent understands the risks associated with communicating sensitive matters,
including time sensitive matters, by e-mail. Purchaser Parent further
acknowledges that instructions and data sent by e-mail may be less
confidential or secure than instructions or data transmitted by other methods.
The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss of the confidentiality of
instructions and data prior to receipt by the Escrow Agent. 
---|---|--- 
   | ¨| CHECK box, if applicable: 
---|---|--- 
  

If the Escrow Agent is unable to obtain confirmation by e-mail, the Escrow
Agent may, at its discretion, confirm by telephone call-back, as described in
Option 1.

  



   | ¨| * _ _Option 3. Delivery of funds transfer instructions by password
protected file transfer system only - no confirmation__. The Escrow Agent

agrees that no further confirmation of funds transfer instructions will be
performed by the Escrow Agent. 
---|---|---

but the Escrow Agent shall confirm funds transfer instructions by ¨
telephone call-back or ¨ e-mail (must check at least one, may check both) to
a person at the telephone number or e-mail address designated on Part II
above. By checking a box in the prior sentence, the party shall be deemed to
have agreed to the terms of such confirmation option as more fully described
in Option 1 and Option 2 above.

 _*The password protected file system has a password that expires every 60
days. If you anticipate having infrequent activity on this account, please
consult with your Escrow Agent before selecting this option._

the security procedure selected by Seller Parent for use in verifying that a
funds transfer instruction received by the Escrow Agent is that of Seller
Parent.

  



  

Seller Parent has reviewed each of the security procedures and has determined
that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-2 best meets its

a funds transfer instruction describes the beneficiary of the payment
