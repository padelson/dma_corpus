the limitation set forth in Article 2.5.2(c), be increased on a CHF-for-
CHF basis by the amount of such shortfall.

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) If, and to the extent, the Net Debt as at the Adjustment Date (as
finally and bindingly determined in accordance with Article 2.5.1) exceeds
CHF 75,135,000, the Preliminary Consideration shall, subject to the
limitation set forth in Article 2.5.2(c), be decreased on a CHF-for-CHF basis
by the amount of such excess.

  

##### 

  

#### (c) **Collar**

  

#### 

  

#### If the aggregate amount of the Net Working Capital and Net Debt
adjustments set forth in Articles 2.5.2(a) and 2.5.2(b) is less than +/-CHF
2,000,000, the Preliminary Consideration shall be neither increased nor
decreased as provided for under Articles 2.5.2(a) and 2.5.2(b). However, if
the aggregate amount of the Net Working Capital and Net Debt adjustments set
forth in Articles 2.5.2(a) and 2.5.2(b) is greater

  

#### 

        
   

  



  

#### than +/- CHF 2,000,000, then the Preliminary Consideration shall be
increased or decreased (as applicable) by the entire amount of the
adjustments (and not just the excess over CHF 2,000,000).

  

#### 

  

### **2.5.3** Payment of the Net Working Capital Adjustment and the Net Debt
Adjustment on the basis of the Final Closing Balance Sheet

  

### ** **

  

Subject to the limitations set forth in Article 2.5.2(c), if the aggregate of
the adjustments under Article 2.5.2 results in a reduction in the Preliminary
Consideration, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such reduction, and if
the aggregate of the adjustments under Article 2.5.2 results in an increase
in the Preliminary Consideration, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of
such increase, in each case in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a bank account designated by the Party receiving payment within five
(5) Business Days after the final and binding determination pursuant to
Article 2.5.1, plus interest accrued thereon between the Closing Date and the
date of payment at the rate set forth in Article 12.3(a).

  



  

## **2.6** Allocation of Purchase Price

  

## ** **

  

#### (a) The Preliminary Consideration shall be allocated in a manner
consistent with _Schedule 2.6(a)_. _Schedule 2.6(a) _reflects the
allocation of the Preliminary Consideration (calculated assuming
a Restructuring Deduction of CHF 42,000,000) among the "Category I Sellers",
"Category II Sellers" and "Category III Sellers" (in each case, as identified
on _Schedule 2.6(a)_).

  

#### 

  

#### (b) A final determination of the amount of the Preliminary Consideration
allocable to the India Sellers (as defined in _Schedule 2.6(a)_) **** shall
be reasonably determined by Seller prior to Closing. If such amount differs
from the amount reflected on _Schedule 2.6(a)_, (i) the amount of
Preliminary Consideration allocated to the Switzerland Sellers (as defined in
_Schedule 2.6(a)_) (in the aggregate) shall be adjusted (upward or downward)
by 50% of such difference, and (ii) the amount of Preliminary Consideration
allocated to the Category III Sellers (in the aggregate) shall be adjusted
(upward or downward) by 50% of such difference.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Except with relation to the India Sellers, the allocation on
_Schedule 2.6(a) _shall be adjusted to reflect the differences between the
items included in the calculation of Net Working Capital and Net Debt (as
determined under Article 2.5) and the amounts for such items reflected on
_Schedule 2.6(a) _based upon the sources of the differences. Adjustments
affecting the items included in the calculation of Net Working Capital and
Net Debt for Category I Sellers and Category II Sellers shall result in
corresponding changes to the allocation to such Sellers on _Schedule
2.6(a)_. Adjustments affecting the items included in the calculation of Net
Working Capital and Net Debt for a Category III Seller will require a
recalculation of Section III of _Schedule 2.6(a) _and

  

#### 

        
   

  



  

#### adjustments that result in a change in the total Net Working Capital or
Net Debt of the Category III Sellers in the aggregate will require a
corresponding change in the "Cash Consideration" reflected on _Schedule
2.6(a) _for the Category III Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, a
difference between the items included in the calculation of Net Working
Capital and Net Debt and the amounts reflected for such items on _Schedule
2.6(a) _may result in an adjustment to the allocation even if such difference
does not result in an adjustment to the Preliminary Consideration pursuant to
Article 2.5. Any adjustments of the Preliminary Consideration that have their
source with the India Sellers shall be allocated (upward or downward)
according to the method described in (d) below.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) The amount, if any, by which the actual amount of the Restructuring
Deduction included in the calculation of Preliminary Consideration is less
than CHF 42,000,000, the corresponding increase in Preliminary Consideration
shall be allocated proportionally to each of (i) the Category I Sellers (ii)
the Category II Sellers (other than the India Sellers), and (iii) the
Category III Sellers (in the aggregate) based upon the allocation of
Preliminary Consideration reflected on _Schedule 2.6(a) _as adjusted
pursuant to Article 2.6(b) and (c).

  

#### 

  

#### (e) Any adjustment to the amount allocated to the "Category III Sellers
(in the aggregate)" shall be allocated among the Category III Sellers by
reference to _Schedule 2.6(a) _by (i) increasing or decreasing the "Initial
Cash Consideration" (as defined in _Schedule 2.6(a)_) **** to reflect such
adjustment, (ii) adjusting the "Net Working Capital" column to reflect any
applicable adjustments, (iii) revising the "%" column, and (iv)
reallocating the revised "Total Consideration." Any adjustment to the amount
allocated to the "Switzerland Sellers (in the aggregate)" shall be allocated
among the Switzerland Sellers as reasonably determined by the Seller.

  

#### 

  

#### (f) Buyer and Seller shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the allocation of the Preliminary Consideration (and adjustments
thereto) provided for in this Article 2.6.

  

#### 

  

#### (g) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and either shall be
required to provide such financial information to the other Party as such
Party may reasonably request in order to be able to verify the calculation
basis for the purchase price allocation, _i.e._ , Net Working Capital, Net
Debt or any other liabilities.

Closing be effected with respect to those TE Assets (together with the

employees, contracts, liabilities and permits (each a **Local Closing** )
shall occur at a month end (or if such month end is not a Business Day, on

Closing Date. In the event that the Local Closing in respect of any such
other TE Assets has not occurred by the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer, within twenty (20) Business Days following
such anniversary, an amount equal to all losses, costs, damages and expenses
suffered or incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates as a result of the inability
of Seller to transfer such other TE Assets, including, without limitation,

Local Adjustment Date, which statement shall be audited by EandY (such
statement, together with an unqualified **** audit opinion from EandY,
except that such opinion may include language to the effect that such
statement has been prepared from separate records of the TE Business, may not
reflect the assets and liabilities as if the TE Business had been operated
separately, and includes certain allocations based on the assumptions and
estimates **** in the TE Statement of Relevant Net Assets, being referred to
as the **Local Closing Balance Sheet **and, upon having become final and

##### (ii) all necessary supporting data for the Local Closing Balance Sheet,
as reasonably requested by Buyer;

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) a determination of the Net Working Capital and the Net Debt as at
the relevant Local Adjustment Date, each calculated by reference to the
aggregate of the respective current assets and current liabilities line items
and financial assets and financial liabilities line items, respectively,
shown on the Local Closing Balance Sheet, as further specified in _Schedule
2.5.1(a)_; provided that all obligations and liabilities owed to or by Buyer
or its Affiliates in connection with the Textile Franchise (but excluding
liabilities which have arisen under normal commercial dealings between Seller
and its Affiliates on the one side and Buyer and its Affiliates on the
other), including obligations and liabilities which have been
incurred between the Closing Date and the relevant Local Closing Date, shall
not be taken into account for determining the Net Working Capital and Net
Debt as at the relevant Local Adjustment Date; and

  

##### 

  

##### (iv) its determination of the adjustments payable pursuant to Article
4.2.6(f), (g), and (h).

  

##### 

  

##### (v) Article 2.5.1 shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ in respect of
the procedure for establishing the Final Local Closing Balance Sheet and the
final and binding determination of the Net Working Capital and Net Debt.

  

##### 

  

#### (f) **Net Working Capital Adjustment**

  

#### 

  

##### (i) If, and to the extent, the Net Working Capital as at the Local
Adjustment Date (as finally and bindingly determined in accordance with
Article 4.2.6(e)) exceeds the Net Working Capital included in the Final
Closing Balance Sheet in relation to the current assets and current
liabilities subject to deferred closings pursuant to this Article 4.2.6, the
Preliminary Consideration shall, subject to subparagraph (h) and (i) below,
be increased on a CHF-for-CHF basis by the amount of such excess.

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) If, and to the extent, the Net Working Capital as at the Local
Adjustment Date (as finally and bindingly determined in accordance with
Article 4.2.6(e)) is less than the Net Working Capital included in the Final
Closing Balance Sheet in relation to the current assets and current
liabilities subject to deferred closings pursuant to this Article 4.2.6, the
Preliminary Consideration shall, subject to subparagraph (h) and (i) below,
be decreased on a CHF-for-CHF basis by the amount of such shortfall.

  



        
   

  



  

#### (g) **Net Debt Adjustment**

  

#### 

  

##### (i) If, and to the extent, the Net Debt as at the Local Adjustment Date
(as finally and bindingly determined in accordance with Article 4.2.6(e)) is
less than the Net Debt included in the Final Closing Balance Sheet in
relation to the financial assets and financial liabilities subject to
deferred closings pursuant to this Article 4.2.6, the Preliminary
Consideration shall, subject to subparagraph (h) and (i) below, be increased
on a CHF-for-CHF basis by the amount of such shortfall.

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) If, and to the extent, the Net Debt as at the Local Adjustment
Date (as finally and bindingly determined in accordance with Article
4.2.6(e)) exceeds the Net Debt included in the Final Closing Balance Sheet in
relation to the financial assets and financial liabilities subject to
deferred closings pursuant to this Article 4.2.6, the Preliminary
Consideration shall, subject to subparagraph (h) and (i) below, be decreased
on a CHF-for-CHF basis by the amount of such excess.

  

##### 

  

#### (h) If the aggregate of the adjustments under Article 4.2.6(f) and (g)
results in a reduction in the Preliminary Consideration, Seller shall pay to
Buyer the amount of such reduction, and if the aggregate of the adjustments
under Article 4.2.6(f) and (g) results in an increase in the Preliminary
Consideration, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such increase, in each
case in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated by the Party receiving payment within five (5) Business
Days after the final and binding determination pursuant to Article 4.2.6(e),
plus interest accrued thereon between the Local Closing Date and the date of
payment at the rate set forth in Article 12.3(a);

  

#### 

  

 _provided, however,_  that the amounts due under this Article 4.2.6(h) shall
not become payable, if, taking into account the aggregate of the adjustments
pursuant to this Article 4.2.6(h) with retroactive effect, the collar set
forth in Article 2.5.2(c) were not to have been exceeded. Any
amount previously paid by a Party on the account of the Net Working Capital
and Net Debt adjustments under Article 2.5.3 which, applying the test set
forth in the preceding sentence, would not have become payable, shall be
repaid to the other Party within five (5) Business Days after the final and
binding determination pursuant to Article 4.2.6(e), plus interest accrued
thereon between the Closing Date and the date of repayment at the rate set
forth in Article 12.3(a).

  



  

#### (i) The Parties shall jointly revisit the above mechanism for the
establishment of the Net Working Capital and Net Debt adjustments in relation
to assets and liabilities transferred to and assumed by Buyer at deferred
Closings pursuant to this Article 4.2.6 to determine whether the procedure
described herein is practicable and

  



        
   

  



  

sensible in light of the particular circumstances and the relevant timing of
such deferred closings. Each Party shall consider in good faith any proposals
made by the other Party with the aim of facilitating the adjustment
procedures in light of the actual circumstances and timing of a deferred
closing, provided such proposed alternatives are economically equivalent to
the adjustments set out herein.

# **6.** Remedies

  

# ** **

  

## **6.1** Remedies of Buyer

  

## ** **

  

### **6.1.1** Sellers Right to Cure and Sellers Liability

  

### ** **

  

With respect to a misrepresentation or a breach of a warranty notified by
Buyer to Seller pursuant to Article 6.1.2, Seller shall have the
right, within a reasonable period of time not exceeding thirty (30) Business
Days after receipt of the Notice of Breach, to put Buyer and|or its
Affiliates in the same position in which it would have been if no
misrepresentation or breach of warranty had occurred. If, and to the extent,
such cure cannot be effected, or is not effected within such time period,
Buyer shall be entitled to claim damages payable to Buyer or, if Buyer so
directs, to the Buyers Affiliates, in the amount which is necessary to
establish the state described in such representation or warranty, including,
without limitation, reasonable costs, fees, disbursements and expenses of
attorneys, experts (including technical consultants and contractors), or
accountants of Buyer and its Affiliates, but excluding lost profits and
punitive damages.

  



  

### **6.1.2** Notice of Breach

  

### ** **

  

#### (a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller a notice in writing describing the
underlying facts of a claim for misrepresentation or breach of warranty in
reasonable detail to the extent then known supported by available
documentation (the **Notice of Breach** ) at the earlier of:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) as soon as reasonably practicable after Buyer having obtained
knowledge of (y) a misrepresentation or breach of warranty pursuant to
Article 5.1 or (z) receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including,
after the Closing Date, the TE Companies, of a written notice of any claim
made or threatened to be made by any third party which Buyer believes is
reasonably likely to give rise to a claim for misrepresentation or breach of
warranty; or

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) in case of a submission to, or a decision or order by, any
competent court, arbitral tribunal or governmental or administrative body
(including, without limitation, tax authorities) which Buyer believes is
reasonably likely to give rise to a claim for misrepresentation or breach of
warranty, as soon as reasonably

  



        
   

  



  

practicable after Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including, after the
Closing Date, the TE Companies, have received any such submission, decision
or order but in any event within such period as will afford Seller a
reasonable opportunity to respond to such submission or to lodge a timely
appeal or other challenge against such decision or order.

  

##### 

  

#### (b) Failure to give the Notice of Breach within the time periods set
forth above shall not exclude Sellers liability hereunder; _provided,
however,_ that Seller shall not be liable for any damage, loss, expense, or
cost to the extent that the same is directly attributable to Buyers failure
to give duly and timely notice within the time periods set forth in this
Article 6.1.2.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) The regime provided for in this Article 6.1.2 shall be in lieu of
and not in addition to Buyers duty to immediately inspect and notify Seller
in accordance with article 201 CO.

  

#### 

  

### **6.1.3** Term of Representations and Warranties

  

### ** **

  

#### The representations and warranties set forth in Article 5.1 shall
survive the Closing Date:

  

#### 

  

#### (a) until the fiftieth (50th) anniversary of the Closing Date or any
longer period as may be permitted under applicable law with respect to
matters covered by Sections 1 of _Schedule 5.1_ (Organization and
Qualification), Section 4 of _Schedule 5.1_ (Due Authorization), Section 5
of _Schedule 5.1_ (No Conflict|Consents), and Section 7 of _Schedule 5.1_
(Assets);

  

#### 

  

#### (b) until the eleventh (11th) anniversary of the Closing Date with
respect to matters covered by Section 26 of _Schedule 5.1_ (Competition Law
Matters);

  

#### 

  

#### (c) until three (3) months after expiry of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to matters covered by Sections 6 and 19 of _Schedule
5.1_ (Taxes|Compliance);

  

#### 

  

#### (d) with regard to the representations and warranties in Section 20 of
_Schedule 5.1_ (Health, Safety and Environment), until the earlier of (x)
the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the date on which a
particular property, facility (including the production sites located on the
Transferred TE Real Property) or business is being put to a use substantially
different from that of the TE Business as conducted at the Closing Date such
that the health, safety and environmental compliance standards for that new
use are materially more stringent than the standards applicable at the
Closing Date (the **Excess Use** ); _provided, however_ , that subpart (y)
hereof shall only affect the survival period set forth herein in respect of
the Excess Use and only in respect of such particular property, business or
facility;

  



        
   

  



  

#### (e) until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date with respect
to matters covered by Section 11 of Schedule 5.1; and

  

#### 

  

#### (f) in case of all other representations and warranties set forth in
_Schedule 5.1_, until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date;

  

#### 

  

 _provided, however_ , that any representation or warranty that would
otherwise terminate in accordance with this Article 6.1.3 will continue to
survive if a Notice of Breach has been duly and timely given under Article
6.1.2 until the related claim for misrepresentation or breach of warranty has
been satisfied or resolved as provided for in Article 14.2; _provided
further, however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers claim (other
than third party claims subject to Article 6.1.5) shall in any event
be precluded unless Buyer initiates arbitration proceedings pursuant to
Article 14.2.2 within twenty-four (24) months of the date of the Notice of
Breach (the **Preclusion Period** ). Such preclusion shall only
become effective if Seller sixty (60) Business Days before the expiration of
the Preclusion Period gives notice in writing (the **Preclusion Notice** )
to Buyer of its imminent expiration. Any delay by Seller in giving the
Preclusion Notice shall cause the Preclusion Period to be extended until the
date on which the full sixty (60) Business Days, calculated from Sellers
actual (delayed) Preclusion Notice, have expired.

  



  

The Parties agree to replace the statute of limitations set forth in article
210 CO by the survival periods set forth in this Article 6.1.3, it
being understood that at the expiry of any such survival periods, as the case
may be, extended by the Preclusion Period, any claim for misrepresentation or
breach of warranty pursuant to this Article 6 shall be deemed null and void (
_verwirkt_ ), without any need for defense or objection on the part of
Seller.

  



  

### **6.1.4** Exclusion of Liability

  

### ** **

  

#### The representations and warranties set forth in Article 5.1 and Schedule
5.1 shall be qualified by those matters and information which have been
Fairly Disclosed in accordance with the letter, including any
written documents annexed to such letter or stored on a CD ROM which
accompanies such letter and which is initialed by the Parties for the
purposes of identification _,_ (i) delivered to Buyer prior to the date of
this Agreement, together with any written documents annexed thereto or stored
on such CD ROM, being in the form set forth in _Schedule 6.1.4_ (the
**Disclosure Letter** ), and (ii) updated at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, it being understood that (x) the delivery of such
update to Buyer shall not affect any of Buyers conditions to Closing under
Article 4.2.2 if such update reflects items that would have caused any one of
the conditions set forth in Article 4.2.2, prior to such update, to have not
been met, and (y) that the delivery of such update shall not affect Sellers
liability for breach of representations reflected in such update, and any
such breach reflected in such update shall not be subject to the Deductible
Amount set forth in Article 11(a). Except as set forth in the previous
sentence with regard to Buyers Closing conditions and Sellers liability for

  



        
   

  



  

#### misrepresentations or breaches reflected in the update to the Disclosure
Letter, the matters and information Fairly Disclosed in the Disclosure Letter
delivered on the date of this Agreement shall operate as a qualification of
Sellers representations and warranties as set forth in Article 5.1 and
_Schedule 5.1_, and Seller shall be under no liability for breaches of such
representations and warranties; _provided, however_ , that neither the
Disclosure Letter nor the update thereto shall have any effect on Sellers
liability for the Excluded Liabilities or for breach of or failure to perform
any provision of this Agreement except, in the case of the Disclosure Letter
delivered on the date of this Agreement, on the representations and
warranties in Article 5.1 and _Schedule 5.1_. For the avoidance of doubt, if
as of the Closing Date, breaches of Sellers representations and warranties
exist, and such breaches result, or are reasonably likely to result, in a
loss to Buyer, its Affiliates and/or the TE Companies that in the aggregate
do not exceed CHF 35,000,000, there shall be no failure of Buyers Closing
conditions in Article 4.2.2(b), but Buyer shall be entitled to assert claims
against Seller with respect to such breaches after the Closing Date. The
exclusion set forth herein shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to, the
exclusions provided for in article 200 CO.

  

#### 

  

### **6.1.5** Third Party Claims

  

### ** **

  

#### (a) In the event of a proceeding involving a claim made by any third
party that could result in a liability of Seller pursuant to Article 6.1 or
an indemnification of Buyer by Seller pursuant to Article 9.1 (an
**Indemnified Claim** ), without prejudice to the validity of the third party
claim or alleged claim in question, the Buyer shall allow, and shall procure
that any of its Affiliates shall allow, Seller and its accountants and
professional advisers to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to such claim and whether and to what extent any amount is payable
in respect of such claim, and for such purpose the Buyer shall, and shall
procure that its Affiliates shall, at Sellers expense, give all such
information, documentation and assistance, including access to premises and
personnel, and the right to examine and copy or photograph any assets,
accounts, documents, books and records, as Seller or its accountants or
professional advisers may reasonably request for such purposes during a
period of not more than twenty (20) Business Days after the date on which
Seller becomes aware of such claim or alleged claim; provided, however, that
Seller and its agents shall not conduct such investigation in a manner that
is materially disruptive to the ability of Buyer or its Affiliates to carry
on its business.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Provided that (x) within thirty (30) Business Days after the date on
which Seller becomes aware of such claim or alleged claim, Seller delivers a
written notice to Buyer requesting that such claim be contested, (y) Seller
acknowledges in such notice its responsibility for such claim if successful,
on the basis of the facts presented by Buyer to Seller, and (z) Seller shall
have agreed, subject to any applicable limitations in Article 6.1 and Article
11, to pay to the Buyer all costs and expenses that the Buyer incurs in
connection with contesting such claim, including, without limitation,

  



        
   

  



  

reasonable attorneys and other advisers and experts fees and
disbursements, then:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) no admission of liability shall be made by or on behalf of the
Buyer or any member of its Affiliates and the claim shall not be compromised,
disposed of or settled and no matter which may affect the outcome of any
dispute or negotiation (including with any taxation authority) in relation to
the claim shall be agreed, in each case without the prior written consent of
Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld;

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) Seller shall, at its own expense, take such action as it shall
deem necessary to avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist, appeal, postpone,
settle, compromise or contest such claim or liability or any adjudication in
respect thereof (including, without limitation, making counterclaims or other
claims against third parties) in the name and on behalf of the Buyer or any
of the Buyers Affiliates concerned, and to conduct any related proceedings,
negotiations or appeals; and

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) the Buyer shall, and will procure that any relevant Affiliate
shall, take all such action and give all such information, documentation and
assistance, including access to premises and personnel, copies of any
relevant correspondence and the right to examine and copy or photograph any
assets, accounts, documents, books and records, for the purpose of avoiding,
disputing, denying, defending, resisting, appealing, postponing, settling,
compromising or contesting any such claim, liability or adjudication as
Seller or its professional advisers reasonably request, and Seller agrees to
keep the Buyer fully informed as to the progress of any such claim and the
defense thereof.

  

##### 

  

#### (c) In the event any of the above conditions (x), (y) and (z) to
Sellers rights under paragraph (b) above is or becomes unsatisfied, (i) the
Buyer may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to, such Indemnified Claim in any manner
reasonably appropriate (and the Buyer need not consult with, or obtain any
consent from, Seller in connection therewith), (ii) Seller will, subject to
any applicable limitations in Article 6.1 and Article 11, reimburse the Buyer
promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against such Indemnified
Claim (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys and other
advisers and experts fees and disbursements), and (iii) Seller will,
subject to any applicable limitations in Article 6.1 and Article 11, remain
responsible for any losses the Buyer may suffer resulting from, arising out
of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Indemnified Claim.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 6.1.5, the procedures
provided for in Article 9.3 shall govern all claims relating to Taxes.

  



        
   

  



  

## **6.2** Remedies of Seller

The provisions of Article 6.1 shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ with respect to
any misrepresentation or breach of warranty by Buyer.

  



  

## **6.3** Exclusive Remedies

  

## ** **

  

The remedies in this Article 6 for misrepresentations and breach of
warranties pursuant to Article 5 and _Schedules 5.1_ and _5.2_  shall be in
lieu of, and not in addition to, the remedies provided for under statutory
law and|or case law. Except for the remedies provided for in Article 9, which

of such agency, marketing and distribution agreements being listed in
_Schedule 7.4.1(b) _and collectively referred to herein as the
**Disclosed Agency Agreements** ).

  

#### 

  

#### (c) During the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, Seller shall accelerate its group-wide code of conduct compliance
program with a specific focus on the TE Business to reinforce the
implementation of such program.

  

#### 

  

### **7.4.2** Additional Actions by the Parties

  

### ** **

  

#### (a) Promptly upon the execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall continue
its review of the Disclosed Agency Agreements, and shall, no later than April
15, 2006, notify Seller of any of such Disclosed Agency Agreements that Buyer
reasonably believes may not fully comply with the Relevant Compliance Rules.
All Disclosed Agency Agreements that are not specifically identified in such
notice as not complying with the Relevant Compliance Rules shall be deemed as
compliant unless Buyer identifies new information prior to the Closing Date
relating to such Disclosed Agency Agreements that causes Buyer, acting
reasonably, to reconsider its initial determination that such agreements were
compliant. In addition, during the time period between the signing of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to review
any new agreements proposed to be entered into by Seller in order to comply
with its obligations under Article 7.4.1(a) (the  **New Agency Agreements**
). As soon as reasonably practicable, Buyer, from time to time, shall notify
Seller of whether Buyer reasonably believes that any proposed New Agency
Agreement does not fully comply with the Relevant Compliance Rules. Buyer
shall also regularly discuss with Seller its views with respect to actions
required in order to ensure that each non-compliant Disclosed Agency
Agreement or New Agency Agreement (each, a **Non-Compliant Agreement**
) fully complies with the Relevant Compliance Rules.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) In the event that Buyer notifies Seller of any Non-Compliant
Agreements pursuant to paragraph (a), Seller shall, or cause its Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable best efforts to renegotiate, modify or take
any other action requested by Buyer with respect to such Non-Compliant
Agreement in order to ensure that such agreement (i) fully complies with the
Relevant Compliance Rules and (ii) is consistent with Buyers reasonable
views regarding the measures to be taken to be compliant with the Relevant
Compliance Rules. Seller agrees to keep the Buyer informed as to the progress
of its efforts and to regularly update the Buyer on the progress of the
satisfaction of its obligations under the preceding sentence.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
shall provide Seller with (i) a written notice of whether, in Buyers
reasonable discretion, any of the Non-

  



        
   

  



  

Compliant Agreements is not, and will not be, as of the Closing Date, in full
compliance with the Relevant Compliance Rules (such agreements being referred
to herein as the **Designated TE Assets** ), (ii) a list of such Designated
TE Assets, and (iii) with respect to each of the Designated TE Assets, a
letter from a reputable law firm in the relevant jurisdiction providing such
firms view that the Designated TE Assets fail to comply with the Relevant
Compliance Rules. The Designated TE Assets shall become Excluded Assets
pursuant to this Agreement and shall not be conveyed by Seller to Buyer at or
after Closing. Provided that Closing occurs, any Non-Compliant Agreements (or
the part relating to the TE Business) shall be terminated by Seller as
promptly as reasonably possible following the Closing Date at no cost or
other liability for Buyer.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Both of the Parties acknowledge that the actions taken in good faith
pursuant to Articles 7.4.1 and 7.4.2 (collectively, the **Compliance
Actions** ) may have a commercial impact on the TE Business. Both of the
Parties further acknowledge and agree that the Purchase Price fully reflects
any impact the Compliance Actions by Seller may have, including, without
limitation, any negative impact on the sales revenue of the TE Business. It
is therefore agreed and understood that, with the exception of Buyers right
to designate Non-Compliant Agreements as Designated TE Assets in accordance
with subparagraph (c) hereof, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any remedy under this Agreement or otherwise, whether based on a
breach of a covenant, representation or warranty or a claim for
indemnification, for damages, to obtain any other reimbursement or
restitution, in respect of such commercial impact of the Compliance Actions,
including, without limitation, any negative impact on the sales revenue of
the TE Business.

  

#### 

  

### **7.4.3** Internal Controls

  

### ** **

  

#### Seller shall, during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, provide Buyer with copies of all correspondence or other
written information received by Seller or its Affiliates from internal or
external auditors or employees identifying or otherwise specifically
referencing any ineffectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting
relating to all or any portion of the TE Business or any TE Company during
the period from January 1, 2005 through the Closing Date, including any
notice or communication regarding the existence of a "material weakness",
"significant deficiency" or "reportable condition" (each within the meaning
of U.S. GAAP), or any similar condition that is reportable under the
generally accepted accounting principles in the jurisdictions relevant to the
TE Companies.

#### 

  

## **8.2** Separation and Know How

Know How retained by the Ciba Group. Seller undertakes not to, and to cause
its Affiliates not to, make any claims against Buyer or any of its Affiliates
based on the use by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than in the

Ciba Groups Know How (including chemical documentation) other than the
Transferred TE Know How to the extent that such Know How was available to or
within the TE Business at the Closing Date or at any time before the Closing
Date. Buyer undertakes not to, and to cause its Affiliates not to, make any
claims against Seller or any of its Affiliates based on the use by Seller or
any of its Affiliates other than in the Textile Franchise of any of the

#### (a) The Parties acknowledge that even after full implementation of all
of the steps set forth in the Carve-out Book and the High Level
Implementation Plan, as amended, through to the Closing Date, the TE Business
will, for a transitional period of time, continue to be dependent on certain
services and supplies to be provided by Seller or its Affiliates for it to be
fully operable. For this purpose, Seller and Buyer will or will cause their
respective Affiliates to, with effect as from the Closing Date, enter into
the ancillary agreements described in _Schedule 8.4(a)_ (the  **TE Ancillary
Agreements** ), for a period of time and at terms and conditions
substantially in accordance with the respective term sheets for such TE
Ancillary Agreements attached hereto as _Schedule 8.4(a)_.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) To the extent Buyer or its designated Affiliates, in accordance with

will or will cause their respective Affiliates to, with effect as from the
Closing Date, enter into the ancillary agreements that are necessary for the
Ciba Group to ensure continuation of its business as conducted immediately
prior to the Closing Date (such agreements the **Ciba Ancillary Agreements**
, and together with the TE Ancillary Agreements and the Excluded Plant Lease
Agreements (as defined below), the **Ancillary Agreements** ), all as
described in _Schedule 8.4(b)_, for a period of time and at terms and
conditions substantially in accordance with the respective term sheets for
such Ciba Ancillary Agreements attached hereto as _Schedule 8.4(b)_.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) With effect as from the Closing Date, the Parties shall enter into
lease agreements governing the Excluded Plants (the **Excluded Plant Lease
Agreements** ), at terms and conditions substantially in accordance with
those set forth in _Schedule 8.4(c)_.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) The Parties hereby agree to negotiate in good faith and in an
expedient manner, following the date hereof, final forms of the Ancillary
Agreements that are consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the
term sheets attached hereto as

  



        
   

  



  

 _Schedules 8.4(b)_ and _8.4(c)_ with respect to each of the Ancillary
Agreements for execution by the Parties, or their designated Affiliates, on
the Closing Date.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) Buyer acknowledges that, upon effectiveness of the Ancillary
Agreements, any service, supply or manufacturing agreement entered into by
Seller or any of its Affiliates and any business unit being part of the TE
Business prior to such effective date shall cease to be effective and be

## ** **

  

#### (a) Any restructuring charges and cash-outs relating to the
restructuring actions under Shape I, Shape II and Shape III, each as and to
the extent identified in _Schedule 8.5(a)_, shall be borne by Seller and
shall not be considered Approved Restructuring Costs as hereinafter defined.
The Parties understand and agree that any severance payments payable to any
of the Transferring Employees, and any associated pension costs or
liabilities, as a result of restructuring actions under Shape I, Shape II and
Shape III, each as and to the extent identified in _Schedule 8.5(a)_, shall
be borne by Seller, regardless of whether such severance payments
become payable on, before or after the Closing Date (all such costs to be
borne by Seller under this Article 8.5(a) being collectively referred
to herein as the **Retained Shape Costs** ). If, and to the extent, Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, including the TE Companies, pay(s), after the Closing
Date, any of the Retained Shape Costs, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for such
payments, plus interest at the rate specified in Article 12.3(a) from the
date of Buyers payment to the date of Sellers reimbursement, within ten
(10) Business Days after any such payment by Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer, with value as
of the same date as such payments are made by Buyer, such payment being equal
to the gross amount of such payments including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the employer social security contributions. In relation to the restructuring
charges and cash-outs made by Seller in implementation of the restructuring
actions under Shape I, Shape II and Shape III, each as and to the extent
identified in _Schedule 8.5(a)_, Seller shall provide Buyer such supporting
information as Buyer may reasonably request in order for Buyer to be able to
verify that Seller has satisfied its obligation hereunder.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, subject to applicable

scope and cost of (i) the restructuring actions under Shape III (other than
those identified in Schedule 8.5(a)) or (ii) other restructuring actions
that, in the case of either (i) or (ii), the Parties mutually agree should be
implemented and paid for by the Seller after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing Date (the **Additional Restructuring Actions** ).
The Parties shall discuss such proposals in good faith with a view to
agreeing the

  



        
   

  



  

timetable for the scope and implementation of such Additional Restructuring
Actions; provided, however, that Seller shall only expend costs with respect
to the Additional Restructuring Actions upon the mutual written agreement of
the Parties regarding the specific amount and timing of the expenditure of
such costs (the **Approved Restructuring Costs** ). If, however, the Parties
do not agree on the timing and expenditure of such costs, no costs on
Additional Restructuring Actions shall be expended by Seller prior to Closing
and there shall be no reduction in the Restructuring Deduction. Except for
the implementation of the Additional Restructuring Actions as mutually agreed
between the Parties pursuant to this Article 8.5(b), it shall be agreed and
understood that any restructuring actions under Shape III (other than those
identified in Schedule 8.5(a)) shall, subject to the Restructuring Deduction,
be the full responsibility of Buyer.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Without prejudice to the allocation of the Retained Shape Costs
pursuant to Article 8.5(a), any Approved Restructuring Costs that, in
accordance with Article 8.5(b), the Parties mutually agree are to be
implemented after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date
shall be paid by Seller and, to the extent actually paid by Seller prior to
the Closing Date, shall reduce the Restructuring Deduction.

  

#### 

  

(d) During the time period between the signing of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of all Approved
Restructuring Costs paid in connection with the Additional Restructuring
Actions. At least ten (10) Business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall provide Buyer with a written statement setting forth detailed financial
information regarding the amount of Approved Restructuring Costs actually
paid by the Seller, together with such supporting documentation as Buyer
shall reasonably request.

Person to be agreed upon (the **Environmental Expert** ) to carry out
the environmental investigations (the **Environmental Investigations** ) at
the sites specified in _Schedule 9.4.1.1_ (the **Identified Sites** )
necessary to establish zero baseline situation reports (the **Baseline
Reports** ) and determine therein Material Contamination, if any, of the
Identified Sites with Dangerous Substances that can reasonably be determined
to exist as of the Closing Date at such sites. All such Material
Contamination identified in such Baseline Reports, together with any other
Material Contamination existing at an Identified Site or emanating or
released therefrom prior to the Closing Date, is hereinafter referred to as
**Material Existing Contamination**. Data collected after the Closing Date
shall not be included in the Baseline Reports unless the Parties agree
otherwise. The scope of the Environmental Investigations shall be determined
by Buyer in cooperation with Seller, including appropriate quality
assurance|quality control requirements; it being understood that the Parties
anticipate that with respect to the Identified Sites set forth in section A
of _Schedule 9.4.1.1_ " _phase 2 investigations_ " (with sampling) will be
carried out, and with respect to the Identified Sites set forth in section
B of _Schedule 9.4.1.1_ " _phase 1 studies_ " (without sampling) will be
carried out. Factual data gathered by the Environmental Expert which meets
such quality assurance/quality control requirements shall be accepted by the
Parties as evidence of the condition of the Identified Sites at the time the
data was collected; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this subparagraph
9.4.1.1 shall be interpreted as precluding the admission/consideration of any

#### (b) The costs and expenses incurred for the Environmental
Investigations, including restoration of each Identified Site to its
condition prior to the commencement of the Environmental Investigations in
the event this Agreement is not consummated for any reason, shall be equally

Environmental Expert or Buyer may require notice to a governmental authority
prior to

  



        
   

  



  

the Closing Date, Seller shall be exclusively responsible for such notice.

Buyer for the costs and expenses of the remedial actions (the **Covered
Remedial Actions** ) incurred at any time following the Closing Date, subject
to Article 9.4.7, in connection with the Material Existing Contamination, if
the remedial actions are required to comply with Environmental Laws as
applicable and in force on or any time following the Closing Date, where
either (x) governmental authorities require such remedial action, or (y)
Buyer has reasonable grounds to believe, after providing notice to and
considering the comments of Seller, that such remedial actions are necessary
to protect the health and safety of exposed or affected persons or to prevent
environmental harm prohibited by Environmental Laws.

  



  

(b) The following procedures shall apply to the Covered Remedial Actions:

  



  

(i) the Covered Remedial Actions shall (x) not establish compliance or
cleanup standards beyond what is legally required under Environmental Laws
applicable and in force on or any time following the Closing Date, as

in the absence of clearly applicable standards, beyond what is reasonably
necessary to protect the health and safety of exposed or affected persons or
to prevent environmental harm prohibited by Environmental Laws; (y) be cost
effective, taking into account the ongoing operation of (and operational
limitations of) the affected facility; and (z) be reasonably proportional to
the effects of the Material Existing Contaminations, consistent with the
legal and other requirements referenced in clause (x) above;

  



  

(ii) with respect to Covered Remedial Actions, Seller and Buyer shall consult
with each other in good faith and generally conduct themselves in a
commercially reasonable manner and in particular comply with the following:

  



  

(1) any Covered Remedial Action to be conducted shall be commenced according
to an action plan established by Buyer in accordance with any applicable
Environmental Laws (the **Remedial Action Plan** ); the Remedial Action Plan
shall identify the planned measures and contain a good faith estimate of the
costs to be incurred. Seller shall have the right to review and comment
on such Remedial Action Plan before its implementation and to propose changes
to the Remedial Action Plan or specific measures provided for therein. Buyer

thereto;

  



        
   

  



  

(2) Buyer shall give Seller the opportunity to be involved in determining the
method and scope of any Covered Remedial Action; _provided, however_ , that
any such involvement shall not prevent the Covered Remedial Action from
being implemented in accordance with Article 9.4.1.2(b)(i) and in compliance
with the Environmental Laws applicable in the respective jurisdiction;

  



  

(3) Buyer shall give Seller reasonable opportunity, by giving reasonable
prior written notice, to attend and participate in any material meetings or
conference calls with the competent authorities with respect to the Covered
Remedial Actions;

  



  

(4) Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of all reports, correspondence,
analytical results and other relevant documentation with respect to the
Covered Remedial Actions; and

  



  

(5) Buyer shall provide Seller a reasonable opportunity of at least twenty-
five (25) Business Days (unless exigent circumstances otherwise require) to
review and comment on drafts of any Remedial Action Plan or other material
submission to governmental authorities or third parties with respect to the
Covered Remedial Actions. Buyer shall take reasonable account of Sellers
comments in relation thereto;

  



  

(iii) subject to the reimbursement of costs and expenses pursuant to the
allocations set forth herein, Buyer shall have the right and obligation,
after reasonable consultation with Seller and without prejudice to its other
rights or obligations hereunder, to take such action as is reasonably
necessary to respond to actual or threatened emergencies at or affecting the
Identified Sites.

  



  

(c) Upon any change in use of any Identified Site of the TE Business, or
divestiture by Buyer of any Identified Site or any asset related thereto to a
third party (including an Affiliate of Buyer), Sellers liability under this
Article 9.4.1.2 shall only continue to the extent such change or divestiture
does not materially adversely affect Sellers position under this Article
9.4.1.2. To the extent of such adverse effect on Sellers position under this
Article 9.4.1.2, Sellers liability hereunder relating to the Identified Site
shall cease to be effective and Buyer shall indemnify Seller and each of its
Affiliates for, and hold each of them harmless against, any liability
resulting thereof.

  



  

(d) In no event shall Seller be liable for costs and expenses for remedial
actions to the extent such actions are required by more stringent standards
under the Environmental Laws as in force at the Closing Date which become
applicable only as a result of a change in use of any Identified Site by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including, as from

  



        
   

  



  

the Closing Date, the TE Companies, to a use substantially different from
that of the TE Business as conducted at the Closing Date.

  



  

(e) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates, including the TE
Companies, not to, conduct, authorize or suffer any testing, sampling,
probing, removal, excavation, digging, plowing or other disturbance of soil
or any subsurface media located at or under the Identified Sites, except (i)
with the prior written approval of Seller (which may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary
for or incidental to any construction, expansion, demolition or refurbishment
works at any of the Identified Sites, (iii) to the extent reasonably
necessary for or incidental to the proper operation of the TE Business, or
(iv) to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable laws.

that the Parties anticipate that with respect to the Leased Sites set forth
in section A of _Schedule 9.4.2_ " _phase 2 investigations_ " (with
sampling) will be carried out, and with respect to the Leased Sites set forth
in section B of _Schedule 9.4.2_ " _phase 1 studies_ " (without sampling)

9.4.2:

  

#### 

  

#### (a) notwithstanding the mutual consultation obligations pursuant to
Article 9.4.1.2(b)(ii), it shall be agreed that Seller shall have full
responsibility in determining the method and scope of the Covered Remedial
Actions, maintain all communications and contacts with relevant agencies with
respect to the Covered Remedial Actions, prepare and make all submissions and
determine the positions to be taken with and in respect of all such relevant
agencies, contract for, oversee, and pay for all activities in respect of the
Covered Remedial Actions, contest or not contest agency actions, and conduct
and defend all litigation relating to the Covered Remedial Actions. In
particular, Seller shall comply with the following:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) any Covered Remedial Action to be conducted shall be commenced
according to a Remedial Action Plan prepared by Seller. Buyer shall have the
right to review and comment on such Remedial Action Plan before its
implementation and to propose changes to the Remedial Action Plan on specific
measures provided for therein. Seller shall take reasonable account of
Buyers comments and proposals in relation thereto;

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) Seller shall give Buyer the opportunity to be involved in
determining the method and scope of any Covered Remedial Action; _provided,
however_ , that any such involvement shall not prevent the Covered Remedial
Action from

  



        
   

  



  

being implemented in compliance with the Environmental Laws applicable in
the respective jurisdiction;

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) Seller shall give Buyer reasonable opportunity, by giving
reasonable prior written notice, to attend and participate in any material
meetings or conference calls with the competent authorities with respect to
the Covered Remedial Actions;

  

##### 

  

##### (iv) Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of all reports,

require) to review and comment on drafts of any Remedial Action Plan or other
material submission to governmental authorities or third parties with respect
to the Covered Remedial Actions. Seller shall take reasonable account of
Buyers comments in relation thereto;

  

##### 

  

#### (b) subject to the reimbursement of costs and expenses pursuant to the
allocations set forth herein, Seller shall have the right and obligation,
after reasonable consultation with Buyer and without prejudice to its other
rights or obligations hereunder, to take such action as is reasonably
necessary to respond to actual or threatened emergencies at or affecting the
Leased Sites;

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Buyer shall, and shall cause any of its Affiliates, including, after
the Closing Date, the TE Companies to grant reasonable access to Seller, any
of its Affiliates and its representatives, employees, agents and contractors
to enter upon the Leased Sites and any building and improvement thereon for

commercially reasonable best efforts to minimize disruption to the business
activities of Buyer or any of its Affiliates in the course of performing the
Covered Remedial Actions; and

  

#### 

  

#### (d) reasonably prior to the expiration of the lease in respect of any of
the Leased Sites, Seller and Buyer shall jointly mandate the Environmental
Expert to carry out environmental investigations at the respective Leased
Site as necessary to establish Baseline Reports and determine therein
Material Contamination, if any, of the respective Leased Site with Dangerous
Substances that can reasonably be determined to have been caused by Buyer
between the Closing Date and the date on which Buyer discontinues its
operation at the respective Leased Site (the **Lease End Date** ). All such
Material Contamination identified in such Baseline Reports, together with any
other Material Contamination caused by Buyer between the Closing Date

  



        
   

  



  

and the Lease End Date, shall be considered Buyer Material Existing
Contamination for purposes of this Article 9.4.2. Data collected after the
Lease End Date shall not be included in the Baseline Reports unless the
Parties agree otherwise. The scope of the Environmental Investigations shall
be determined by Seller in cooperation with Buyer, including appropriate
quality assurance|quality control requirements. Factual data gathered by
the Environmental Expert which meets such quality assurance|quality
control requirements shall be accepted by the Parties as evidence of the
condition of the respective Leased Site at the time the data was collected;
_provided, however,_ that nothing in this subparagraph (d) shall be
interpreted as precluding the admission/consideration of any
additional relevant and material evidence regarding Buyer Material Existing
Contamination. Buyer shall, subject to the terms of this Article 9.4.2, be
liable to Seller for the costs and expenses of the remedial actions incurred
at any time following the Lease End Date in connection with the Buyer
Material Existing Contamination, to the extent provided in the Excluded Plant
Lease Agreements.

  

#### 

  

### **9.4.3** HF Site

  

### ** **

  

#### Seller shall undertake and complete the following at its own cost
(unless specified otherwise herein):

  

#### 

  

#### (a) an upgrade of the buildings at the Basel Site (Klybeck) to comply
with all earthquake protection requirements, as agreed with or ordered by the
authorities ( _Gesundheitsdepartement Basel-Stadt|Kontrollstelle f ur Chemie
und Biosicherheit_) to whom Seller has submitted the proposal attached hereto
as _Schedule 9.4.3(a)_. This upgrade shall be completed within the timeframe
ordered by or agreed with the competent authorities. With respect to
aforementioned earthquake protection requirements and the procedures to be
observed in relation thereto, Article 9.4.2(b) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_
;

  

#### 

  

#### (b) an updated risk assessment of the production unit relating to
hydrogen fluoride in buildings K-90 and K- 650 and related or potentially
affected buildings, operations, equipment and storage facilities (the **HF
Site** ), using the Dutch risk management framework and requirements. The
risk assessment will be completed in accordance with such reasonable protocol
and procedures as Buyer may specify (it being understood that such protocols
and procedures shall not be more stringent than the protocols and procedures
Buyer would apply under its own risk and safety standards and shall not
include any measures designed to optimize production at the HF Site) and will
address all known and reasonably foreseeable risks to life, property and the
environment that may arise from operations, accidents, fires, explosions and
natural disasters (including, without limitation, earthquakes), at, affecting
or emanating from the HF Site, including reasonably foreseeable risks to
pending or proposed uses on

  



        
   

  



  

adjacent or nearby properties, such as the Tivona project. Seller shall
undertake its commercially reasonable best efforts to have this risk
assessment completed prior to Closing and submitted both to Buyer and the
authorities ( _Gesundheitsdepartement Basel-Stadt|Kontrollstelle f ur Chemie
und Biosicherheit_). The costs for the risk assessment will be shared equally
between Seller and Buyer;

  

#### 

  

#### (c) utilizing the results of the risk assessment referred to in Article
9.4.3(b), Seller shall, with the prior written approval of Buyer and
following prior consultation with the relevant authorities: (i) take all
actions necessary to bring the risks presented by the HF Site within
"tolerable" limits in accordance with the Dutch risk management framework
and requirements (it being understood that with respect to
requirements specifically designed to addressing risks resulting from pending
or proposed uses on adjacent or nearby properties, such as the Tivona
project, Seller shall only be required to take the respective actions if,
within the general timeframe ordered by or agreed with the
competent authorities within which the actions to be undertaken hereunder are
to be undertaken, such pending or proposed use is reasonably certain to
be implemented), and (ii) take all such further steps as may be necessary to
satisfy any additional requirements imposed by the aforementioned authorities
as a result of such risk assessment (together the **Risk Management Actions**
). Any necessary governmental authorizations shall be obtained by Seller.
Where the Risk Management Actions involve work on the HF Site, Seller and
Buyer shall coordinate to minimize the impact of the work on ongoing
operations and assure the safety of all workers. Seller shall undertake its
commercially reasonable best efforts to undertake all actions to be
undertaken hereunder within the timeframe ordered by or agreed with the
competent authorities;

  

#### 

  

#### (d) for avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the Parties that
Seller should bear all costs necessary to address the risk management issues
described in clauses (a) through (c) above. Should the authorities require
any actions of Buyer in order to ensure compliance of the HF Site with all
applicable regulations regarding earthquake protection (based on clause (c)
above) or protection against other risks (based on the updated risk
assessment referred to in clauses (b) and (c) above), Seller shall indemnify
Buyer for all costs incurred by Buyer in undertaking such actions.

  

#### 

  

### **9.4.4** Sellers Liability for Off-Site Releases

  

### ** **

  

Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, and Buyers Affiliates,
officers, agents and employees, against and from all claims, liabilities,
losses and expenses suffered or incurred at any time arising from or in
connection with any release, prior to the Closing Date, by or from any part
of the TE Business at any location other than Identified Sites, of any
Dangerous Substance into the environment. For avoidance of doubt, Sellers
liability to Buyer for the

  



        
   

  



  

costs and expenses of remedial actions relating to Identified Sites and
Leased Sites shall be exclusively governed by Articles 9.4.1.2 and 9.4.2,
respectively.

  



  

### **9.4.5** Sellers Liability for Non-compliance

  

### ** **

  

#### (a) Subject to the limitations in this Article 9.4.5, Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, and Buyers Affiliates, officers, agents
and employees, against and from all claims, liabilities, losses and expenses
suffered or incurred at any time as a result of the failure by any part of
the TE Business, as of the Closing Date, to hold or be able to comply with
the terms of any environmental legal obligation, consent,
permit, authorization or license required for the ownership, operation or
conduct of such part of the TE Business. Should any such environmental
compliance issue exist in relation to any site and, prior to Closing, be
disclosed in writing by Seller to Buyer, Seller shall only be liable for
indemnifying Buyer for any losses and expenses suffered or incurred as a
result of such non-compliance that are in excess of CHF 100,000 at that
particular site.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) In the event of failure by any part of the TE Business, as of the
Closing Date, to hold or be able to comply with the terms of any
environmental legal obligation, consent, permit, authorization or license
required for the ownership, operation or conduct of such part of the
TE Business, which was not disclosed in writing by Seller to Buyer prior to
the Closing, Buyer shall immediately inform Seller of such failure, and in
respect of the actions to be undertaken by Buyer to establish compliance,
the procedures set forth in Article 9.4.1.2(b) shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_. In no event shall Seller be liable for indemnifying Buyer for any
increased costs or expenses incurred by Buyer as a direct consequence of
Buyers failure to provide Seller with sufficient time to exercise its rights
under Article 9.4.1.2(b).

  

#### 

  

### **9.4.6** Insurance

  

### ** **

  

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, as of the Closing Date, the TE Business
will not be insured under any insurance policies maintained by Seller or any
of its Affiliates, except (i) in the case of claims made policies (including
those relating to the health, life or property of any personnel), to the
extent that a claim has been reported prior to the Closing Date and
relates to the TE Business and (ii) as otherwise agreed to in writing by
the Parties. From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall have no obligation
of any kind to maintain any form of insurance covering the TE Business;
_provided, however,_ that Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to
permit the TE Business to have the benefit of reasonable uninterrupted
insurance coverage.

  



        
   

  



  

### **9.4.7** Environmental Liability of the Parties

  

### ** **

  

#### (a) Buyer shall reimburse Seller any amount paid by Seller, following
the Closing Date, to third parties or governmental authorities in respect of
the TE Business which are in excess of the liability of Seller allocated
under this Article 9.4; _provided, however,_ that Seller has timely informed
Buyer of such claims and has given Buyer reasonable opportunity to assist
Seller in defending such claims.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Seller shall have no liability to Buyer pursuant to Article 9.4.1.2
relating to Identified Sites after the fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, without prejudice to any claims thereunder notified to Seller
prior to such date. For the avoidance of doubt, this 15-year limitation on
Sellers liability does not apply to Leased Sites (Article 9.4.2) or to
Sellers liabilities pursuant to Articles 9.4.3, 9.4.4 or 9.4.5.

  

#### 

  

### **9.4.8** Reallocation of Liabilities

  

### ** **

  

If any court, tribunal, governmental entity or other legal authority imposes
any liability on either Party pursuant to Environmental Laws or Health and
Safety Laws that is substantially different from the manner in which
the liability is allocated between the Parties pursuant to this Article
9.4, then the Party subject to the increased liability shall be reimbursed by
the other Party to the extent necessary to restore the allocation of
liabilities under this Article 9.4.

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall only be published after
Buyer and Seller shall have consulted and agreed on the contents of such
public announcements or press releases. Nothing in this Agreement shall
restrict or prohibit:

  



  

#### (a) any announcement or disclosure required by law or by any competent
authority or by any competent securities exchange;

carry out their duties (conditional upon any such Person agreeing to keep
such information confidential for

  



        
   

  



  

so long as the disclosing Party is obligated to do so in accordance with this
Article, any other provision of this Agreement or applicable law).

  

#### 

  

## **10.2** Termination of Commitments

  

## ** **

  

#### (a) Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable best
efforts to procure the termination of the commitments, guarantees and similar
undertakings, including any verbal commitments vis-a-vis financial
institutions, all as set forth in _Schedule 10.2_ (the **Undertakings** ),
made or given by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any TE Company)
in favor of the TE Business on or before the Closing Date by either offering
to assume or replace such Undertakings or offering to procure the full
performance of any obligations of the TE Business underlying any such
Undertakings. Buyer shall provide to Seller (i) complete and accurate details
of its commercially reasonable best efforts to procure the termination of the
Undertakings and (ii) confirmation of such full, irrevocable and
unconditional (but subject to Closing) discharge of the Undertakings
of Seller and its Affiliates as have been obtained (other than any TE
Company) no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.
All commercially reasonable costs and expenses arising in connection with
the termination of the Undertakings shall be borne by Buyer (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, any internal costs of Seller).

  

#### 

  

#### (b) At the request of Buyer, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer in procuring the termination of the
Undertakings; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall not be required to make
any payment to any Person, incur any material liability or obligations or
forego any material benefits in order to obtain such termination.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) If any of the Undertakings is not terminated by the Closing Date,
Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts, with the reasonable
assistance of Seller, to obtain with respect to such non-terminated
Undertaking (the **Deferred**   **Undertaking** ) any necessary third party
consent with retroactive effect as of the Closing Date; _provided, however_ ,
that (i) Seller shall not be required to make any payment to any Person,
incur any material liability or obligations or forego any material benefits
in order to obtain such consent, and (ii) Buyer shall not be required to
incur any commercially unreasonable expense to obtain such consent.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Any Deferred Undertaking shall be performed by Buyer on its own
behalf but in the name of Seller (to the extent so permitted by applicable

Undertaking as of the Closing Date as if such Deferred Undertaking had been
transferred to Buyer. Seller shall exercise, or shall procure that any of its
Affiliates exercises, the rights and obligations arising under such Deferred
Undertakings on a fiduciary basis and shall be bound by

  



        
   

  



  

the instructions of Buyer. Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates
for, and hold each of them harmless against, all claims and liabilities
arising out of, or in connection with, the fiduciary performance by Seller or
its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with Buyers non-proper
performance of the Deferred Undertakings.

  

#### 

  

## **10.3** Transfer | Change of Control Clauses of the Transferred TE
Contracts

  

## ** **

  

#### (a) Buyer and Seller will cooperate in seeking the transfer of all
Transferred TE Contracts that relate exclusively or primarily to the TE
Business, it being understood that the contracts primarily relating to the TE
Business can only be transferred if, under the relevant Transferred TE
Contract, a partial transfer is permissible, **** from the Asset Seller
Companies to Buyer or its designated Affiliates, effective as of or as soon
as practicable after the Closing Date. To the extent required, for each
Transferred TE Contract, Seller and Buyer will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to effect transfer of that Transferred TE
Contract to Buyer or its designated Affiliate so that Buyer or its designated
Affiliate is substituted for the Asset Seller Companies under the Transferred
TE Contract and the Asset Seller Companies are, subject to Articles
2.2.2(a)(ii) and 9.1, relieved of all further liabilities and rights relating
to such Transferred TE Contract (except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement).

  

#### 

  

#### (b) In the event that any Transferred TE Contract (but excluding any of
the Transferred TE Contracts that are Key Assets) cannot be transferred in
accordance with Article 10.3(a), with respect thereto, then as of the Closing
Date, this Agreement, to the extent permitted by law and the terms of the
Transferred TE Contract, shall be deemed to effectuate full assignment by the
Asset Seller Companies to Buyer or its designated Affiliates of all of the
Asset Seller Companies benefits and burdens under such Transferred TE
Contract, and Buyer or its designated Affiliates shall be deemed the Asset
Seller Companies agent for purposes of discharging all of the Asset Seller
Companies obligations thereunder except as otherwise provided in Article
10.3(e). The Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take
all necessary steps and actions to provide Buyer or its designated Affiliates
with the benefits of such Transferred TE Contract, and to relieve the Asset
Seller Companies of the performance and other obligations thereunder (subject
to Articles 2.2.2(a)(iii) and 9.1).

  

#### 

  

#### (c) In the event that Seller shall be unable to make the transfer or
assignment of one (1) or more Transferred TE Contracts as described in
Article 10.3(a) and (b) (but excluding any of the Transferred TE Contracts
that are Key Assets), or if such attempted transfer or assignment would give
rise to the exercise of any right of termination, or would otherwise
adversely affect the rights of the Asset Seller Companies or Buyer or its
designated Affiliates under such Transferred TE Contract, or would not assign
all of the Asset Seller Companies rights thereunder at the Closing

  



        
   

  



  

Date, Seller and Buyer shall, from and after the Closing Date, and for a
period of one (1) year from the Closing Date (or such longer period as Buyer
shall, in its reasonable discretion, designate) continue to cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to effect transfer or assignment of such
Transferred TE Contract to provide Buyer or its designated Affiliates with
such rights. In respect of any Transferred TE Contract, until an assignment
in accordance with Article 10.3(a) or (b) to Buyer, or an Affiliate
designated by Buyer, has taken place, Seller shall hold the benefit of the
Transferred TE Contract for Buyer from the Closing Date and in so acting
shall:

  

#### 

  

##### (i) perform all such acts and afford to Buyer such assistance as it may
reasonably require for the purpose of vesting in the Buyer the full
commercial benefit of such contract as from the Closing Date (including,
without limitation, exercising its rights thereunder pursuant to instructions
given by the Buyer);

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) provide without cost to Buyer all assistance reasonably requested
by the Buyer for invoicing products and services delivered by Buyer, its
Affiliates or their assistants to such customers, and collecting any monies
not paid by the customers when due (including, without limitation, initiating
debt collection proceedings and assigning, if requested by Buyer, all or part
of the claims against such customers);

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) receive any payments made after the Closing Date by a third party
under any such contract, record the payment separately in its books and
forward such payments to Buyer within ten (10) Business Days of receipt;

  

##### 

  

##### (iv) deliver to Buyer as soon as possible after receipt any notice or
other document concerning or relating to such contract received by Seller;

  

##### 

  

##### (v) receive any goods delivered to it, pursuant to such contract and
deliver such goods as directed by Buyer; and

  

##### 

  

##### (vi) not, without prior written consent from Buyer, consent to any
modification or amendment of, or terminate such Transferred TE Contract, or
waive, terminate or consent to the termination of any of its rights
thereunder.

  

##### 

  

#### (d) To the extent that Buyer or its designated Affiliates are provided
the benefits of any Transferred TE Contract referred to herein, whether under
Article 10.3(a), (b) or (c), Buyer or its designated Affiliates shall perform
on behalf of the Asset Seller Companies and for the benefit of any third
party the obligations of the Asset Seller Companies thereunder or in
connection therewith. Buyer agrees to discharge, and indemnify Seller and
each of its Affiliates for and hold each of them harmless against, all
liabilities of Seller or its Affiliates relating to such performance
or failure to perform,

  



        
   

  



  

except to the extent attributable to the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of Seller or its Affiliates and in the event of a failure of such
indemnity, Seller and each of its Affiliates shall cease to be obligated
under this Agreement with respect to the Transferred TE Contract which is the
subject of such failure.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) If, at the end of the one (1) year period **** described in clause
(c) or such later date as designated by Buyer (acting reasonably), Seller is
still unable to effect the transfer or assignment of any such Transferred TE
Contract, Seller shall be in breach of its obligations under this Agreement
and Buyer shall be entitled to recover from Seller all losses, costs, damages
and expenses suffered or incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates as a result of
the inability of Seller to effect such transfer or assignment, including,
without limitation, any direct, indirect or consequential costs, losses,
expenses and damages which so result. None of the limitations on or
exclusions of the liability of Seller set forth in Articles 6.1 or 11(a) and
(b) shall apply.

a Party

  

## ** **

  

#### (a) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to procure that any consents, approvals or waivers of any
third party under any contract or agreement to which a TE Company is a Party,
which gives rise to a right of termination upon change of control and which
is material to the TE Business, all as set forth in _Schedule 10.4_, shall
have been obtained on or before the Closing Date.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) In the event that the Parties shall have not been able to obtain any
consent, approval or waiver of any third party under such contracts, but
excluding any such contract that is a Key Asset, Seller and Buyer shall, from
and after the Closing Date, continue to cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all such consents, approvals or waivers required
to transfer such contracts to Buyer or its designated Affiliates.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) To the extent that any such consents or waivers are not obtained,
and until the applicable consent, approval or waiver is obtained, or, if
later, one (1) year after the Closing Date (or such longer period as Buyer,
in its reasonable discretion, shall designate), Article 10.3(c) shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) To the extent that Buyer or its designated Affiliates are provided
the benefits of any contract subject to Article 10.4(c), Buyer or its
designated Affiliates shall perform on behalf of Seller or its Affiliates and
for the benefit of any third party the obligations of Seller or its
Affiliates thereunder or in connection therewith. Buyer agrees to discharge,
and indemnify Seller and each of its Affiliates for and hold each of them
harmless against, all liabilities of each of Seller and its
Affiliates relating to such

  



        
   

  



  

performance or failure to perform, except to the extent attributable to the
gross negligence or wilful misconduct of Seller or its Affiliates, and in the
event of a failure of such indemnity, Seller and each of its Affiliates shall
cease to be obligated under this Agreement with respect to the contract which
is the subject of such failure.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) If, at the end of the one year period described in clause (c) or
such later date as designated by Buyer (acting reasonably), Seller is still
unable to effect the transfer or assignment of any such contract, Seller
shall be in breach of its obligations under this Agreement and Buyer shall be
entitled to recover from Seller all losses, costs, damages and expenses
suffered or incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates as a result of the inability
of Seller to effect such transfer or assignment, including, without
limitation, any direct, indirect or consequential costs, losses, expenses and
damages which so result. None of the limitations on or exclusions of the
liability of Seller set forth in Articles 6.1 or 11(a) and (b) shall apply.

  

#### 

  

## **10.5** Assignment of Trademarks With the Consent of a Third Party Only

#### (a) With respect to the Transferred TE Trademarks which are subject to a
prior right agreement or similar agreement existing at the date of this
Agreement with any third party listed in _Schedule 10.5_. Buyer acknowledges
that such Transferred TE Trademarks cannot be assigned to Buyer, or that the
rights and obligations under such agreements cannot be assigned to Buyer,
unless the third party involved gives its consent. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, Seller and Buyer shall enter into good
faith negotiations with such third parties to obtain such consent

the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall thereafter continue to cooperate and
use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consent that
remains outstanding.

reasonably request, Buyer shall prepare and Seller shall execute such

of the Transferred TE Trademarks, the Transferred TE Domain Names and the
Transferred TE Patents. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
record within a reasonable period of time the transfer of such Trademarks,
domain names and Patents with the competent authorities, unless Buyer has
elected to abandon or withdraw such Trademarks, domain names or Patents. The

territory), Buyer, including the TE Companies, shall be entitled to sell the
Inventory of the TE Business existing as at the Closing Date that is labeled

such approvals of competent government authorities as may be necessary to
change Buyers labeling for each of the products (as identified by a TE

liability against Seller, on an aggregate basis, exceeds CHF 15 million less
any Pre-Closing Liability Amount (the **Deductible Amount** ), whereupon
Sellers liability to Buyer shall be equal to the amount exceeding the
Deductible Amount; _provided, however_ , that (i) Seller shall not be liable
to Buyer for any single claim for damages asserted by Buyer against Seller
under this Agreement for breaches of representations or warranties unless
such claim, on a stand-alone basis, or series of related claims taken
together, exceeds the amount of CHF 250,000 (the **De Minimis Amount** ), and
(ii) the Deductible Amount and De Minimis Amount shall not be applicable to
breaches of Sellers representations or warranties in Sections 1, 4, 5, 6, 7,
19, 20 and 27 of _Schedule 5.1_.

damages under this Agreement for breaches of representations and warranties
shall not exceed **** CHF 100 million **** (the **Cap** );  _provided,
however_ , that the Cap shall not be applicable (i) if, and to the extent,

#### 

  

#### (c) Subject to paragraph (d) below, Sellers liability in respect of any
breach of Sellers obligations under this Agreement shall be excluded or

or is increased as a result of any legislation, regulation, or rule of law
not in force at the Closing Date or the withdrawal after the Closing Date of
any concession previously made by any relevant authority or as a result of
any change made or introduced on or after the Closing Date in any
legislation, regulation, or rule of law of any relevant authority, whether or
not such change or withdrawal purports to be effective retrospectively in
whole or in part.

  

##### 

  

#### (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the apparent contrary, (i) the
limitations on Sellers liability set forth in this Article 11(a) and (b)

Seller shall be responsible for and will pay any VAT (or equivalent Tax)
levied in connection with this Agreement, subject to the conditions below:

  



  

#### (a) Seller, using its best efforts, shall cooperate with Buyer to ensure
that the sale and transfer of the TE Shares and the Transferred TE Assets or
any part thereof under this Agreement is not treated as either a taxable
supply of goods or services or otherwise taxable for the purposes of VAT, or
that VAT may be settled by filing a notification instead of paying VAT in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the respective

  



        
   

  



  

TE Shares or the Transferred TE Assets are situated, in particular where such
sale and transfer is regarded, for purposes of the applicable VAT
legislation, as a transfer of all or part of the assets of a business as a
going concern. Seller shall, if requested by Buyer, appeal any determination
of the competent VAT authority that such sale and transfer is taxable if the
VAT at issue exceeds CHF 100,000.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) If, notwithstanding such efforts, any competent VAT authority
determines within the applicable limitation period that VAT is chargeable in
respect of the supply of all or any of the TE Shares or the Transferred TE
Assets or part thereof under this Agreement, and Seller is assessed to VAT in
relation to the transaction(s), Seller will, within ten (10) Business Days of
being notified by the VAT authority of such a decision, issue a valid VAT
invoice (or other such appropriate documentation) to Buyer in connection with
the transaction such as will allow Buyer to pay the Seller the consideration
inclusive of VAT and to validly recover the VAT incurred.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to procure that any TE Companies
shall leave any VAT group, insofar as they are members to such a group, as at
the Closing Date.

  

#### 

  

### **12.1.2** Other Taxes

contemplated under this Agreement shall be shared equally between the
Parties.

Returns.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Buyer shall be responsible for the timely preparation and filing of
all Tax Returns of or with respect to the TE Companies and the Transferred TE
Assets required to be filed after Closing Date. With respect to any such Tax

deliver to Seller for its review and comments a copy of such Tax Return along
with a determination of the portion of the amount of Taxes reflected on such
Tax Return that are attributable to the period (or portion thereof) ending on
or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall cooperate fully and make changes to
such Tax

  



        
   

  



  

Return and determinations to reflect reasonable comments received from
Seller. No later than five (5) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return,
Seller shall pay to Buyer the Taxes shown as due on such finalized Tax Return
that are attributable to the period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date (reduced by the portion, if any, of such Taxes reflected in
Net Working Capital and Net Debt and thus subject to the adjustments set
forth in Article 2.5). Upon receipt thereof Buyer shall cause the Tax Return
to be filed and the Taxes shown due on such Tax Return to be paid.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) For purposes of Article 9.3 and this Article 12, (i) with respect to
periods beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing
Date, the amount of Tax attributable to the period ending on the Closing Date
shall equal the amount (determined by an interim closing of the books as of
the Closing Date except for Taxes based on capital or the value of any
assets, which shall be prorated on a daily basis) of Tax which would have
been due with respect to the period covered by such Tax Return if such
taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date (for the avoidance of
doubt, such Tax calculations shall not include any benefit to the Seller
restructuring expenses economically borne by the Buyer) and (ii) any Tax
measured by net income, gross income, receipts, operations, assets or capital
shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the net income, gross
income, receipts, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such
Tax is measured, regardless of whether any other rights (including the right
to do business) for another taxable period are obtained by the payment
of such Tax.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably and timely requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns and any audit or proceedings with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such filing, audit or
proceedings and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to

hereunder. Without limiting the forgoing, Seller shall make available to
Buyer the Tax work papers and information (excluding privileged Tax advice
and sensitive information regarding the non-TE Segment of Seller) of the TE
Business and companies of the Ciba Group (including factual
information regarding inter-company transactions, transfer pricing and
royalty payments) and access to Sellers personnel knowledgeable about such
information. All requests for such information shall be addressed to the Ciba
Group headquarters tax department. Each Party agrees to retain all of its
books with respect to Taxes pertinent to the TE Business relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiry of the
statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) relating to Taxes and
penalty proceedings of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by, and
comply with, all record retention agreements entered into with any tax
authority.

  



        
   

  



  

#### (e) Prior to Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer information,
including a summary document, containing a full description of the transfer
pricing practices and methodologies for all relevant jurisdictions of the TE
Business in sufficient detail to allow Seller to assume the administration of
the Tax function and the record-keeping required for Tax purposes. Such
description shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

Closing Date without the written consent of Seller. Seller shall not be
liable for any portion of any settlement of any contest relating to such
Taxes without their written consent.

Affiliates arrangements other than this Agreement or any agreement
contemplated hereunder).

as at the date thereof, based on the method of presentation
described therein.

  



  

(b) There are no liabilities (actual or contingent) attributable to the TE
Business (such business as of September 30, 2005, based on the method of
presentation described in the TE Statement of Relevant Net Assets) **** of the
type required to be reflected as liabilities on a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP other than the liabilities which are reflected on

derived from the Ciba Groups consolidated financial management information
(as opposed to a bottom-

  



        
   

  



  

up collection of a country- and/or site specific-financial data), and, on
this basis, materially reflects, on an EBIT-level, at cost and prior to
stand-alone adjustments, the effects on the TE Business (for the period
ending September 30, 2005, based on the method of presentation described in
the TE Income and Expense Statement) of all assets, liabilities and employees

prior to the date of this Agreement. For purposes of evaluating such
consistency, account shall be taken of, (i) the method of presentation and
the assumptions used for the TE Statement of Relevant Net Assets and the TE
Income and Expense Statement for the period ending September 30, 2005 and
(ii) any of the additional adjustments to be made to properly reflect the
scope, the nature and the assumptions of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement, which adjustments may include (without limitation):

  



  

(A) any changes to the transaction structure ( _e.g.,_ an asset instead of a
share transfer);

  



  

(B) any changes to the assets being transferred to Buyer ( _e.g._ ,
excluding the Excluded Plants or any assets relating thereto, or extension

(C) any changes to the Tangible Property;

  



  

(D) any changes in assumptions for pension and benefit plans;

  



  

(E) any changes in the definition of Net Working Capital and Net Debt not
reflected in the TE Statement of Relevant Net Assets;

  



  

(F) any impact on standard product cost ( _e.g._ , depreciation) a
consequence of the impairment recorded as per December 31, 2005 of the TE
Segments long-lived assets and goodwill;

  



  

(G) any changes to tolling, supply and other Ancillary Agreements and the IT
Service Agreement; or

  



        
   

  



  

(H) any changes in assumptions used and final headcount and cost of Group
Services employees and services to be transferred to the Buyer as a result of

respect of the TE Business any revised financial forecast or budget for the
2006 fiscal year.

after the Closing Date, a Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(b) subject to the restructuring actions under Shape I, II, and III, as
identified in _Schedule 8.5(a)_, the Additional Restructuring Actions and

 ** **

  

 **5.** No Conflict | Consents

  



  

(a) The execution of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the
