objections in dispute may be submitted by Parent or the Representative for
resolution to a "big four" accounting firm to be selected jointly by the
Representative and Parent within the five days following the last day of such
15-day period or, if the Representative and Parent are unable to mutually
agree within such five-day period, such accounting firm shall be Ernst and
Young (so long as neither party has, at the time of the dispute, any
significant business relationship with Ernst and Young) (such accounting firm,

customary engagement letter with the Referee; (ii) Parent and the
Representative shall furnish to the Referee such workpapers and other
documents and information relating to such objections as the Referee may

present to the Referee any material relating to the determination of the
matters in dispute and to discuss such determination with the Referee; (iii)
to the extent that a value has been assigned to any objection that remains in
dispute, the Referee shall not assign a value to such objection that is
greater than the greatest value for such objection claimed by either Parent
or the Representative or less than the smallest value for such objection
claimed by either Parent or the Representative; (iv) the determination by the
Referee of Final Net Debt and Final Working Capital, as set forth in a
written notice delivered to both Parent and the Representative by the
Referee, shall be made in accordance with this Agreement and shall be binding
and conclusive on the parties and shall constitute an arbitral award that is
final, binding and unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a
court having jurisdiction thereof; and (v) 50% of the fees and expenses of
the Referee shall be paid by Parent and the remaining 50% of the fees and
expenses of the Referee shall be deducted from the Contingent Payment
Amount.

 (a) If the Final Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the absolute value of the Final Adjustment Amount shall be deducted from the Contingent Payment Amount. 

   

 (b) If the Final Adjustment Amount is a positive number (the " _Parent Final Balance Sheet Adjustment Payment Amount_ "), then Parent shall immediately tender payment, in immediately available funds, to (i) the persons who were holders of Accuro Common Stock and Accuro Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Second Effective Time the consideration to be received with respect to such shares in accordance with the terms of _Sections 2.7(a)(ii)(C)_ and  _2.7(a)(iv)(C)_ , as the case may be, and (ii) the Payroll Agent, the aggregate amounts payable to holders of Options and Unauthorized Options pursuant to _Sections 2.9(b)(C)_,  _2.9(c)(C)_ , _2.9(d)(C)_ and _2.9(e)(C)_ , as the case may be (and Parent shall direct the Payroll Agent to promptly pay such amounts in immediately available funds to the persons who were holders of Options and Unauthorized Options immediately prior to the Second Effective Time). 

   

 (c) If subsequent to the payment of any amounts pursuant to _Section 2.14(a) _or  _Section 2.14(b)_, but not later than the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent is required to pay any Company Transaction Costs or Debt that should have been but was not included in the calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount, it shall deliver a written notice (a " _Post-Adjustment Statement_ ") to the Representative that sets forth the nature and amount of 

    ##### 

  

    

such Company Transaction Costs or Debt, as applicable. If within 15 days
following delivery of a Post-Adjustment Statement to the Representative, the
Representative has not delivered to Parent written notice (the " _Post-
Adjustment Objection Notice_ ") of its objections to the Post-
Adjustment Statement (such Post-Adjustment Objection Notice must contain a
statement describing in reasonable detail the basis of such objections), then
(i) the amounts in the Post-Adjustment Statement shall be deemed final and
conclusive and (ii) Parent shall be entitled to deduct such amounts from
the Contingent Payment Amount and the Contingent Payment Amount shall be
reduced accordingly. If the Representative delivers a Post-Adjustment
Objection Notice within such 15-day period, then Parent and the
Representative shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections, for a
period not to exceed 15 days from the date of delivery of the Post-Adjustment
Objection Notice. If at the end of the 15-day period there are any objections
that remain in dispute, then the remaining objections in dispute may be
submitted by Parent or the Representative for resolution to the Referee.
The Referee shall determine the amounts of the items set forth in the Post-

dispute are submitted to it. If any remaining objections are submitted to the
Referee for resolution, (i) Parent and the Representative shall enter into a
customary engagement letter with the Referee; (ii) Parent and the
Representative shall furnish to the Referee such workpapers and other
documents and information relating to such objections as the Referee may
reasonably request and are available to that party or its Subsidiaries (or
its independent public accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity
to present to the Referee any material relating to the determination of the
matters in dispute and to discuss such determination with the Referee; (iii)
to the extent that a value has been assigned to any objection that remains in
dispute, the Referee shall not assign a value to such objection that is
greater than the greatest value for such objection claimed by either Parent or
the Representative or less than the smallest value for such objection claimed
by either Parent or the Representative; (iv) the determination by the Referee
of the final amounts of the items set forth in the Post-Adjustment Statement,
as set forth in a written notice delivered to both Parent and
the Representative by the Referee, shall be made in accordance with this
Agreement and shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon
which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof;
and (v) 50% of the fees and expenses of the Referee shall be paid by Parent
and the remaining 50% of the fees and expenses of the Referee shall be
deducted from the Contingent Payment Amount. 

   

 (d) If prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company is required to make an "earn-out" payment pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of March 26, 2007 by and among The Woodmoor Group, Inc., Accuro and the other persons party thereto (the " _Woodmoor Performance Payment_ "), then the amount of such Woodmoor Performance Payment (as finally determined) shall be deducted from the Contingent Payment Amount and the Contingent Payment Amount shall be reduced accordingly. Whether or not the Woodmoor Performance Payment is required to be paid by the Company, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection therewith shall be deducted from the Contingent Payment Amount and the Contingent Payment Amount shall be reduced accordingly. The Representative shall have the right to make all decisions regarding and give directions concerning the Woodmoor Performance Payment, including preparing all reports, statements and calculations in connection with the determination of the Woodmoor Performance Payment and controlling all discussions with any other Person in connection with the Woodmoor Performance Payment (including in any dispute resolution 

    ##### 

  

    

process). Each of Parent and the Company agree to cooperate with the
Representative with respect to any matter concerning the Woodmoor Performance
Payment and to provide the Representative with prompt notice of all
correspondence, inquiries and requests that it receives in connection with
the Woodmoor Performance Payment. Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, consent to the entry of a judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Woodmoor Performance Payment, without the
prior written consent of the Representative. 

   

 (e) Subject to _Section 10.1(a)_, the right of Parent to deduct amounts from the Contingent Payment Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent in the event that (i) the Final Adjustment Amount results in an adjustment in Parents favor (ii) the Company is required to pay any Company Transaction Costs or Debt not included in the calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount or (iii) the Company is required to pay the Woodmoor Performance Payment. In each case, such right to deduct shall terminate on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (subject to any pending proceedings or claims pursuant to this _Section 2.14_) and shall be subject to the procedures and requirements of this _Section 2.14_. 

   

 (f) Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 2.14_, Parent shall have no right to deduct any amounts from the Contingent Payment Amount.

The right to receive payment pursuant to this _Section 2.15_ shall not be transferable by any Contingent Payment Recipient. Parent may pay the Contingent Payment Amount at its election, in whole or in part, (x) by wire transfer of immediately available funds or (y) in shares of Parent Common Stock, which shares shall be valued on the basis of the average of the closing prices for the Parent Common Stock, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, for the 15 trading days ending on and including the trading day that is two trading days immediately prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date. Parent shall not issue such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.15_ except in compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350(i). As a condition to the issuance of any shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.15_, Parent shall represent and warrant to the applicable Securityholders that such shares are duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are not subject to, or issued in violation of, any preemptive rights. 

  

 2.16. _Illustrative Calculation of Consideration_. For the avoidance of doubt,  _Company Disclosure Schedule 2.16_ sets forth an example, based on the assumptions stated therein, of the amounts to which Securityholders will receive at the Closing pursuant to this  _Article II_.

each of its Subsidiaries and all other information with respect to their
respective businesses, together with the opportunity, at the sole cost and
expense of the Company, to make copies of such books, records and other
documents and to discuss the business of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
with such directors, officers and counsel for Parent as the Company may
reasonably request for the purposes of familiarizing itself with Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
not have access to personnel records of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other information that in Parents good faith opinion the
disclosure of which could subject Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to risk
of liability. In addition, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or
representatives shall contact any personnel or any customers or suppliers
of Parent or its Subsidiaries regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the express prior written consent of the Chief Executive
Officer or Chief Financial Officer of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably

Agreement shall remain subject in all respects to the Company
Confidentiality Agreement until the Closing. 

   

 5.3. _Notification of Certain Matters_.

No such notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the parties or the conditions to their respective obligations hereunder. 

  

 5.4. _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall take such action as may be necessary so that for a 12 month period following the Closing Date, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain after the Closing in the employ of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be provided employee benefits, plans and programs (including but not limited to incentive compensation, life insurance, welfare, 401(k), salary continuation and fringe benefits but excluding any equity-based compensation arrangements) which are no less favorable than those made available to similarly situated employees of Parent. For purposes of eligibility to participate in all benefits provided by Parent to such employees (and for purposes of vesting in any 401(k) benefits provided by Parent to such employees), the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be credited with their years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and any predecessors thereof to the extent that such service is taken into account under the similar Employee Benefit Plan of Company and its Subsidiaries. The eligibility of any employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries to participate in any welfare benefit plan or program of Parent shall not be subject to any exclusions for any pre-existing conditions if such individual has met the participation requirements of similar benefit plans and programs of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Amounts paid before the Second Effective Time by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any health plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall, after the Second Effective Time, be taken into account in applying deductible and annual out-of-pocket limits applicable under the health plans of Parent provided as of the Second Effective Time to the same 

    ##### 

  

    

extent as if such amounts had been paid under such health plans of Parent.
Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4(a) _shall create any rights in any
employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment
for any specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever. Except
as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to or shall be interpreted to prevent the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from
making future changes in the terms and conditions of employment
(including the compensation) of any officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing Date, to the extent an employees right to receive any payments and/or benefits that may, separately or in the aggregate, constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and the applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder, the Company shall request each such employee to waive such employees right and, to the extent that such consent is obtained, shall submit such payments and/or benefits to the stockholders of the Company for a vote, meeting the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the applicable rulings and regulations thereunder. The Company shall forward to Parent prior to such submission to such stockholders copies of all documents prepared by the Company in connection with this _Section 5.4(b)_. If the Company shall not have obtained the consent of an employee, as contemplated by the first sentence of this _Section 5.4(b)_, the Closing Cash Merger Consideration or, to the extent not a reduction to the Closing Cash Merger Consideration, Working Capital shall be reduced by an amount equal to 40% of the amount of any "parachute payment," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(5)(B), to be paid to the employee (the amount of such aggregate reduction, the " _280G Reduction Amount_ "). 

   

 (c) After the Second Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan, the Company or Parent may amend, modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan in existence prior to the Closing. No provision of this _Section 5.4_ will create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter, and nothing in this _Section 5.4_ is intended to interfere with Parents or Accuros right from and after the Closing Date to terminate the employment or provision of services by any director, employee, independent contractor or consultant. 

   

 (d) If requested by Parent at least five business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the Closing, any Employee Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Board of Directors of the Company of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (e) On or after the Closing Date, if Parent, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall terminate the employment of any of the persons set forth on _Schedule 5.4(e)_ 

    ##### 

  

    

hereto or any such person remains employed by Parent, the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries for the period following the Closing Date set forth opposite
such Persons name on  _Schedule 5.4(e)_, Parent shall pay such person the
amount set forth opposite such persons name on _Schedule 5.4(e)_. 

   

 5.5. _Post-Closing Access to Information_. From and after the Closing, the Representative may, at its option, prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all income Tax Returns for the Company (but not the Subsidiaries of the Company) the liability with respect to which is payable by the Securityholders (" _Flow-Through Returns_ ") for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and Parent shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all such Flow-Through Returns prior to filing. Parent shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to), during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, make available and provide the Representative and its representatives (including, without limitation, counsel and independent auditors) with reasonable access to all information, files, documents and records (written and computer) necessary for the preparation of the Flow-Through Returns. 

  

 5.6. _Indemnification of Officers, Managers, Directors, Employees and Agents_. 

  

 (a) All rights to indemnification, advance of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Second Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former managers, directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_") as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or regulations (or comparable organizational documents) shall survive following the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of six years, and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries to comply with and honor the foregoing obligations. 

   

 (b) Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such certificates of incorporation and regulations in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who at and at any time prior to the Closing were managers, directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) For a period of six years after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Third Merger Surviving Company to, maintain directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance covering the DandO Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing directors and officers liability insurance or fiduciary liability insurance policies on terms no less advantageous to such DandO Indemnified Persons than such existing insurance; _provided_ , _however_ that in no event will Parent or the Third Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the Third Surviving Corporation will obtain that amount of directors and officers insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. 

    ##### 

  

  

 (d) If Parent or the Third Merger Surviving Company or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to the extent not assumed by operation of law, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Third Merger Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.6_. 

   

 (e) The provisions of this _Section 5.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each person entitled to indemnification under this _Section 5.6_ and such persons heirs, legatees, representatives, successors and assigns, it being expressly agreed that such persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.6_. 

   

 5.7. _Debt Financing_. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain the Debt Commitment Letter in full force and effect, and not amend, terminate or waive any provisions under such Debt Commitment Letter which amendment, termination or waiver would adversely affect the availability of the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, and (ii) comply, to the extent within Parents control, with all of the covenants of Parent in the Debt Commitment Letter and take all actions, to the extent within Parents control, necessary or desirable to cause all of the conditions to the funding of the financing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied as promptly as practicable following the date hereof and in coordination with the satisfaction of the other closing conditions set forth herein, including obtaining any opinions of legal counsel required by the Lender thereunder and, to the extent within Parents control, assure that there is no breach or default or event of default under any of its existing financing agreements, (iii) accept any changes in the terms and conditions of the proposed financing contemplated in the "market flex" provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or fee letter related thereto, (iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and (v) consummate the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing. Parent agrees to notify the Company following its receipt of notification by any financing source under the Debt Commitment Letter that it does not intend to provide or asserts its inability or refusal to provide any financing described in the Debt Commitment Letter. If funding of the indebtedness contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter becomes unavailable for any reason, Parent will use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing on terms that are no less favorable to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or fee letter related thereto including, for the avoidance of doubt, the "market flex" (an " _Alternative Financing_ "). Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of any material adverse developments relating to the proposed debt financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to satisfy the closing conditions to the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing) that are within its control. Parent acknowledges that receipt of the Debt Financing or any other financing is not a condition to the Closing.

 _7.2(f_ ) and the delivery of the officers certificate referenced in
_Section 7.2(a)_ and  _Section 7.2(b)_ would have been satisfied if the

certificate to the Company certifying that Parent would have waived such
conditions) and (z) the proceeds of the Debt Financing and, if applicable,
the Alternative Debt Financing, shall be unavailable on the date of such
termination (regardless of whether or not Parent complied with Section 5.7)

Business Days of such termination by the Company, a fee of $15,000,000 in cash
(the " _Financing Failure Termination Fee_ "), which Financing Failure
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company or any
other Person against Parent with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby in the event of a Debt Financing
Failure. In the event Parent pays the Company the Financing Failure
Termination Fee subject and pursuant to the terms and conditions of this

Subject to  _Section 10.1(b)_, from and after the Closing, except for claims for fraud (other than equitable fraud) based upon the representations and warranties made by the Company or Parent (in the case of Parent, including the First Merger Subsidiary and the Second Merger Subsidiary) expressly set forth in this Agreement, and in respect of willful and malicious breaches of covenants and other agreements in this Agreement, no party to this Agreement, or third-party beneficiary hereof, shall assert any claim (whether in law or in equity) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Solely with respect to any claim by Parent (including the First Merger Subsidiary and the Second Merger Subsidiary) described in the preceding sentence, each Signing Seller will be responsible for such Signing Sellers pro rata share of any damages of Parent (determined on the basis of the value received by such Signing Seller of the aggregate Closing Per Share Merger Consideration received by all Signing Sellers at the Closing). The parties further agree that any claim permitted by the second and third sentences of this _Section 10.1(a)_ that is not asserted in a lawsuit filed within the applicable statute of limitations shall be barred, and that nothing in this _Section 10.1(a)_ shall be deemed to extend or waive any applicable statute of limitations.

    #####

 10.3. _Waiver of Compliance_. Any failure of Parent, the First Merger Subsidiary or the Second Merger Subsidiary on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition contained herein may be waived only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound by such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any other failure. 

  

 10.4. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Applicable Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Governmental Authority making such determination is authorized and instructed to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in order that the transactions contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 10.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (which term shall be deemed to include the exhibits and schedules hereto and the other certificates, documents and instruments delivered hereunder), the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto and supersede all prior agreements, letters of intent and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreements.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, whether by operation of law or otherwise; provided that, Parent may collaterally assign this Agreement to the Lender or any provider of Alternative Financing so long as Parent remains liable under the terms of this Agreement. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void. 

  

 10.14. _Rules of Construction_. 

  

 (a) Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been represented by independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same upon the advice of said independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not be construed against any party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any party that drafts it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived. 

   

 (b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, that such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, or that such items are material to the Company, Parent, the First Merger Subsidiary or the Second Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_, respectively, merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, as an exception to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, with respect to such other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto. 

   

 (c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of such Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be disregarded in construing the language contained therein. The words " _this Agreement_ ," " _herein_ ," " _hereby_ ," " _hereunder_ " and " _hereof_ " and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words " _this Section_ ," " _this subsection_ " and words of similar import, refer only to the Sections or subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word " _including_ " (in its various forms) means " _including, without limitation_." Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include any other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise expressly requires. Unless the context otherwise requires, all defined terms contained herein shall include the singular and plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such defined terms. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to a specific time shall refer to New York City time. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the parties hereto covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in part (either as an increase or a reduction), more than once in the calculation of (including any component of) the Estimated Net Debt, Estimated Working Capital, Final Adjustment Amount, Final Net Debt, Final Working Capital, or any other calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion (either as an increase or a reduction) would be to cause such amount to be over- or under-counted for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 10.15. _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO GENERAL LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY LAWS AND ANY OTHER PROVISIONS SET FORTH HEREIN THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE GOVERNED BY THE TLLCA). 

  

 10.16. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 10.16_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. 

   ##### 

  

  

 10.17. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_. 

  

 (a) The parties hereto submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any such state or Federal court, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims may be heard and determined exclusively in such Delaware court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such claim shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any claim relating to this Agreement or any related matter against any other Person not a party hereto or its assets or properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 

   

 (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter in any state or Federal court located in the State of Delaware and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any such court. 

   

 10.18. _Equitable Remedies_. The parties agree that money damages or other remedy at law would not be a sufficient or adequate remedy for any breach or violation of, or default under, this Agreement by them and that in addition to all other remedies available to them, each of them shall be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to an injunction restraining such breach, violation, or default or threatened breach, violation, or default and to any other equitable relief, including specific performance, without bond or other security being required;  _provided_ that the Company and Accuro agree that specific performance shall not be available to compel Parent, the First Merger Subsidiary or the Second Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Second Merger and the Third Merger or the other actions to be taken as part of the Closing if Parent is unable to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing (provided that for the avoidance of doubt, specific performance and other equitable relief shall be available to the Company to compel Parent to comply with its obligations under _Section 5.7_ ). 

  

ARTICLE XI 
 THE REPRESENTATIVE 

  

By their execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company, Parent, the
First Merger Subsidiary, the Second Merger Subsidiary and the Representative
hereby agree as follows: 

   

 11.1. _Authorization of the Representative_. The Representative hereby is appointed, authorized and empowered to act as the agent of the Securityholders in connection with, and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and in connection with the activities to be performed on behalf of the Securityholders under this Agreement, for the purposes and with the powers and authority hereinafter set forth in this _Article XI_, which shall include the full power and authority: 

  

 (a) to take such actions and to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation 

    ##### 

  

    

of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as the Representative, in
its reasonable discretion, may deem necessary or desirable to give effect to
the intentions of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; 

   

 (b) as the Representative of the Securityholders, to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Securityholders and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement and each other Transaction Document and, in connection therewith, to (i) resolve all questions, disputes, conflicts and controversies concerning the determination of any amounts pursuant to _Article II_ ; (ii) employ such agents, consultants and professionals, to delegate authority to its agents, to take such actions and to execute such documents on behalf of the Securityholders in connection with _Article II_ as the Representative, in its reasonable discretion, deems to be in the best interest of the Securityholders; (iii) assert or institute any claim, action, proceeding or investigation; (iv) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any claim, action, proceeding or investigation initiated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other Person, against the Representative, and receive process on behalf of any or all Securityholders in any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and compromise or settle on such terms as the Representative shall determine to be appropriate, give receipts, releases and discharges on behalf of all of the Securityholders with respect to any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation; (v) file any proofs, debts, claims and petitions as the Representative may deem advisable or necessary; (vi) settle or compromise any claims asserted under _Article II_; (vii) assume, on behalf of all of the Securityholders, the defense of any claim that is the basis of any claim asserted under _Article II_; and (viii) file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or award rendered in any of the foregoing claims, actions, proceedings or investigations, it being understood that the Representative shall not have any obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have liability for any failure to take such any action; 

   

 (c) to waive or refrain from enforcing any right of the Securityholders or any of them and/or of the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; and 

   

 (d) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all action that the Representative, in its sole and absolute direction, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the activities described in paragraphs (a) through (c) above and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. 

  

Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon the
communications of the Representative relating to the foregoing as the
communications of the Securityholders. None of Parent or its Subsidiaries (a)
need be concerned with the authority of the Representative to act on behalf
of all Securityholders hereunder, or (b) shall be held liable or accountable
in any manner for any act or omission of the Representative in such
capacity. 

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the Representative may not enter into or grant
any waivers or consents described in 

    ##### 

  

    

 _Section 11.1(a)_ unless such waivers or consents shall affect each
Securityholder similarly and to the same relative extent, and (ii) any such
waiver or consent that does not affect any Securityholder similarly and to
the same relative extent as it affects other Securityholders must be executed
by such Securityholder to be binding on such Securityholder. 

  

The grant of authority provided for in this _Section 11.1_ is coupled with an
interest and is being granted, in part, as an inducement to the Company,
Parent, the First Merger Subsidiary and the Second Merger Subsidiary to enter
into this Agreement and shall be irrevocable and survive the death,
incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Securityholder and shall be
binding on any successor thereto. 

  

The Representative may be changed at any time and from time to time by the
written action of Securityholders holding (or that held immediately prior to
the First Effective Time) more than fifty percent (50%) of the Common Units
and Series A Preferred Units, taken as a whole, and shall become effective
upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent. Except
as provided in the foregoing sentence, in the event that for any reason the
most recent Representative shall no longer be serving in such capacity,
including, without limitation, as a result of the death, resignation or
incapacity of the Representative, the outgoing Representative shall appoint
a successor Representative, and if the outgoing Representative fails or is
unable to appoint a successor, then the Securityholders holding (or that held
immediately prior to the First Effective Time) more than fifty percent (50%)
of the Common Units and Series A Preferred Units, taken as a whole, shall
appoint such successor, such that at all times there will be a Representative
with the authority provided hereunder. Any change in the Representative
pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall become effective upon delivery of
written notice of such change to Parent. 

   

 11.2. _Compensation; Exculpation; Indemnity_. 

  

 (a) The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation for the performance of its service hereunder. 

   

 (b) In dealing with this Agreement and any instruments, agreements or documents relating thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Representative hereunder or thereunder, (i) the Representative shall not assume any, and shall incur no, responsibility whatsoever to any Securityholder by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, unless by the Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct, and (ii) the Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the Representative to liability to any Securityholder unless by the Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. Except as set forth in the previous sentence, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Representative, in its role as Representative, shall have no liability whatsoever to the Company, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Each Securityholder, severally, shall indemnify the Representative up to, but not exceeding, an amount equal to the aggregate portion of the amounts received by such Person under  _Article II_ of this Agreement, which indemnification shall be paid by such Securityholder  _pro rata_ in accordance with the portion of the aggregate amounts received by such Person under  _Article II_ of this Agreement, against all damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the amount of any judgment against it, of any nature whatsoever, arising out of or in connection with any claim or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of the Representative hereunder, under the other Transaction Documents or otherwise, except for such damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the amount of any judgment against or settlement by the Representative due solely to the Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct, including the willful breach of this Agreement. The foregoing indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to which the Representative may be entitled apart from the provisions hereof. In the event of any indemnification under this _Section 11.2(c)_, each Securityholder shall promptly deliver to the Representative full payment of his, her or its ratable share of such indemnification claim. 

   

 (d) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Each Securityholder, severally, shall reimburse the Representative for all of the Representatives reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses, which reimbursement shall be paid by such Securityholder _pro rata_ in accordance with the portion of the aggregate amounts received by such Person under _Article II_ of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, under no circumstances shall a Securityholders indemnification and reimbursement obligations pursuant to _Sections 11.2(c)_ and _11.2(e)_ exceed the aggregate amount received by such Person under _Article II_ of this Agreement.
