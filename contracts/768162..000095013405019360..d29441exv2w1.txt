<PAGE>

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

      THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("AGREEMENT") is made and entered into
as of October 18, 2005, by and among HOSHIZAKI AMERICA, INC., a Georgia
corporation ("PARENT") and LANCER CORPORATION, a Texas corporation (the
"COMPANY"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
EXHIBIT A, attached hereto and incorporated herein.

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, Parent and the Company intend to effect a merger of a designee of
Parent to be formed as a corporation under the laws of the State of Texas
("MERGER SUB") with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and
the Texas Business Corporation Act (the "MERGER"). Upon consummation of the
Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent.

      WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and the Company have
approved this Agreement and the Merger.

      WHEREAS, to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
certain Company stockholders are executing voting and support agreements in
favor of Parent (the "VOTING AGREEMENTS") whereby they have agreed to vote their
shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises,
representations and warranties set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the
parties agree as follows:

SECTION 1. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

      1.1 MERGER OF MERGER SUB INTO THE COMPANY. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION").

      1.2 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the Texas Business
Corporation Act (the "TBCA").

      1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices
of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP, 600 Peachtree Street, N.E., Suite
2400, Atlanta, Georgia 30308, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be designated by Parent
(the "CLOSING DATE") after the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions
set forth in Sections 6 and 7 shall have been so satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable
requirements of the TBCA (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") shall be duly executed by
the Company and concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the
Closing delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Texas for filing.
The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas or such
other date and time as Parent and the Company may mutually agree and include in
the Certificate of Merger (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

      1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS. Unless otherwise
determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

            (a) the Certificate of Merger shall include such amendments,
schedules or supplements as may be required under the TBCA to provide that the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

Corporation from and after the Effective Time shall be, or be the same as, the
Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be Lancer Corporation;

            (b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time; and

            (c) the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

      1.5 CONVERSION OF SHARES; CONVERSION OF OPTIONS.

            (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder
of the Company:

                  (i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the
Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the treasury
of the Company) shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor;

                  (ii) except as provided in clause "(i)" above and except for
Dissenting Shares, each share of Company Common Stock then outstanding shall be
converted into the right to receive $22.00 in cash per share, without any
interest thereon (the "PRICE PER SHARE"); and

                  (iii) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per
share, of Merger Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of
Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

            (b) Schedule 2.3(b) sets forth all Company Options held by any
Person as of the date of this Agreement. All of such Company Options have
vested, or prior to or at the Effective Time will vest, in the holders thereof,
in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Company Option Plans. In
connection with the Merger, at the Effective Time each Company Option shall be
converted into the right to receive, as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) (A) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option,
multiplied by (B) an amount equal to the remainder of (1) the Price Per Share,
less (2) the exercise price per share of such Company Option, as set forth on
Schedule 2.3(b), less (ii) the amount of all applicable withholding taxes, if
any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Prior to the Closing
Date, (a) the Company shall take all necessary or appropriate action to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.5(b) and ensure that from and after
the Effective Time no Person (other than Parent) shall have any rights with
respect to the capital stock or equity of the Company, including without
limitation obtaining a release from each holder of Company Options substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, and (b) the Company shall terminate
the Company Option Plans to be effective as of the Effective Time and the
Surviving Corporation shall not assume any liabilities under the Company Option
Plans.

      1.6 CLOSING OF THE COMPANY'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time: (a)
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights as Company stockholders, except as provided herein or by
applicable Legal Requirement; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares
of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously
representing any shares of Company Common Stock (a "COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATE")
is presented to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

      1.7 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

            (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select The Bank of
New York, N.A. to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "EXCHANGE AGENT").
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent in trust (pending the Effective Time) for the benefit of the holders of
Company Stock Certificates immediately available funds in an amount not less
than the amount necessary to make the payments for the shares of the Company
Common Stock contemplated by Section 1.5(a)(ii) (such amount, the "EXCHANGE
FUND").

            (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent will mail to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates (i)
a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of
Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock
Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for the aggregate Price
Per Share relating thereto. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the
Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal
and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or
Parent, (1) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to
receive from the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the aggregate Price Per Share relating thereto, and (2) the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.7, each Company Stock Certificate shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive the aggregate Price Per Share relating thereto as contemplated by
Section 1.5(a)(ii). If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of the aggregate Price Per Share relating thereto, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an
appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company
Stock Certificate.

            (c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the date on
which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered
their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the
aggregate Price Per Share relating thereto.

            (d) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder
of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of any Legal Requirement. To
the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

            (e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with
respect to any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to any Governmental Body
pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement.

      1.8 APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Notwithstanding Section 1.5 hereof, shares of the
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded
such holder's right to appraisal for such shares in accordance with Article 5.12
of the TBCA (and who has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his, her or its
right to such appraisal) ("DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be converted into a
right to receive cash pursuant to Section 1.5, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by the TBCA. If after the Effective
Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or
its right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive cash

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

as provided in Section 1.5, without interest thereon. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company under Article 5.12
of the TBCA for appraisal of shares of the Company Common Stock, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any determination of fair value or any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

      1.9 FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the
Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company
and otherwise) to take such action.

SECTION 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      The Company represents and warrants to Parent as of the date hereof that,
except for the exceptions or qualifications as are disclosed in writing in the
disclosure schedules supplied by the Company to Parent of even date herewith
(the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES"), which disclosure shall provide an
exception to or otherwise qualify those representations and warranties of the
Company contained in the section of this Agreement corresponding to the Schedule
where such disclosure appears (for the avoidance of doubt, if any section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule discloses an item or information in such a way as to
make its relevance to the disclosure required by another section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule clearly apparent based solely on the substance and
particularity of such disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the matter
shall be deemed to have been disclosed in such other section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate
cross-reference to such other section) and, with respect to the representations
and warranties other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2.3 below, except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed prior
to the date of this Agreement:

      2.1 DUE ORGANIZATION; SUBSIDIARIES. Each of the Acquired Companies (as
defined below) is a company duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and has all
necessary power and authority: (i) to conduct its business in the manner in
which its business is currently being conducted; (ii) to own, operate, hold
under lease and use its assets as, and in the place where, its assets are
currently owned, operated or held and used; and (iii) to perform its obligations
under all Contracts by which it is bound. Each of the Acquired Companies is
qualified to do business as a foreign Entity, and is in good standing, under the
laws of all jurisdictions where the nature of its business requires such
qualification. The Company has Delivered to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of (i) the certificate or articles, as the case may be, of incorporation,
bylaws and other charter or organizational documents of each of the Acquired
Companies, including all amendments thereto and (ii) the minutes and other
records of the meetings and other proceedings (including any actions taken by
written consent or otherwise without a meeting) of the equity holders of each of
the Acquired Companies, the board of directors or managers of each of the
Acquired Companies and all committees of the board of directors or managers of
each of the Acquired Companies (the items described in (i), and (ii) above,
collectively, the "COMPANY CONSTITUENT DOCUMENTS"). The Company Constituent
Documents are in full force and effect on the date hereof. The Company has no
Subsidiaries, except for the Entities identified in Schedule 2.1. (The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the
"ACQUIRED COMPANIES"). Except as identified on Schedule 2.1, none of the
Acquired Companies has any equity interest or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or
similar interest in, any Entity, other than the Company's interest in its
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.1, none of the Acquired
Companies has, at any time, been a general partner of, or has otherwise been
liable for any of the debts or other obligations of, any other Entity.

      2.2 AUTHORITY; BINDING NATURE OF AGREEMENT. The Company has the absolute
and unrestricted right, power and authority to enter into and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company (at a
meeting duly called and held) has unanimously (a) determined that the Merger is
advisable and fair and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (b) authorized

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

                  (ix) any Contract or other agreement, commitment or discussion
with respect to the sale, transfer or divestiture of all or any material portion
of the assets or equity interests of any Acquired Company.

            (b) Each Acquired Company Contract is valid and in full force and

            (d) To the Company's Knowledge, no event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time)
could reasonably be expected to (i) give any Person the right to declare a
default or exercise any remedy under any Material Contract; (ii) give any person
the right to receive or require a significant rebate, significant chargeback,
significant penalty or significant change in delivery schedule under any
Material Contract; (iii) give any Person the right to accelerate the maturity or
performance of any Material Contract; or (iv) give any Person the right to
cancel, terminate or modify any Company Material Contract in each case, in a
manner that could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

      2.8 SALE OF PRODUCTS; PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. Each product sold or
licensed by any of the Acquired Companies to any Person conformed and complied
in all respects with the terms and requirements of any applicable warranty or
other Contract and with all applicable Legal Requirements at the time it was
sold except to the extent that any nonconformance or noncompliance could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect on the
Acquired Companies.

      2.9 LIABILITIES. None of the Acquired Companies has any accrued,
contingent or other liabilities of any nature, either matured or unmatured
(whether or not required to be reflected in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and whether due or to

                                      -12-

due), except for: (a) liabilities identified as such in the "LIABILITIES" column
of the Company Balance Sheet; and (b) normal and recurring liabilities that have
been incurred by the Acquired Companies since the Company Balance Sheet Date in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices which have
not resulted in any material increase in the Company's liabilities from those
disclosed or provided for in the Company Balance Sheet or in the related notes.

      2.10 COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. Each of the Acquired Companies
is, and at all times since December 31, 2001 has been, in material compliance
with all applicable Legal Requirements. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.10,
since December 31, 2001, none of the Acquired Companies has received any notice
or other communication from any Governmental Body regarding any actual or
possible violation of, or failure to comply with, any Legal Requirement.

      2.11 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS. Each of the Acquired Companies holds all
material Governmental Authorizations necessary to enable such Acquired Company
to conduct its business in the manner in which such business is currently being
conducted and as proposed to be conducted. All such Governmental Authorizations
are valid and in full force and effect. Each Acquired Company is, and at all
times since December 31, 2001 has been, in compliance with the terms and
requirements of such Governmental Authorizations except where the failure to
comply with such terms and requirements has not had, and could not reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Companies.
Except as set forth on Schedule 2.11, since December 31, 2001, none of the

      2.12 TAX MATTERS. All Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of
any of the Acquired Companies with any Governmental Body with respect to any

RETURNS") (a) have been or will be filed on or before the applicable due date
(including any allowable extensions of such due date), and (b) have been, or
will be when filed, prepared in all material respects in compliance with all
applicable Legal Requirements. No claim has ever been made by a Governmental
Authority in a jurisdiction in which an Acquired Company does not file Tax
Returns that such Acquired Company is or may be subject to taxation by such
jurisdiction. Schedule 2.12 lists each jurisdiction in which each Acquired
Company files a Tax Return. All amounts shown on the Acquired Company Returns to
be due on or before the Closing Date have been or will be paid on or before the
Closing Date. The Company Financial Statements fully accrue all actual and
contingent liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods through the dates
thereof in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There are
no unsatisfied liabilities for material Taxes (including liabilities for
interest, additions to tax and penalties thereon and related expenses) with
respect to any notice of deficiency or similar document received by any Acquired
Company with respect to any material Tax (other than liabilities for Taxes
asserted under any such notice of deficiency or similar document which are being
contested in good faith by the Acquired Companies and with respect to which
adequate reserves for payment have been established). There are no liens for
material Taxes upon any of the assets of any of the Acquired Companies except
liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable. No extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any of the Acquired Company Returns has been
granted (by the Company or any other Person), and no such extension or waiver
has been requested from any Acquired Company other than an extension resulting
from the filing of a Tax Return after its due date in the ordinary course of
business. No claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the Company's
Knowledge, has been threatened against or with respect to any Acquired Company
in respect of any material Tax. None of the Acquired Companies has entered into
or become bound by any agreement or consent pursuant to Section 341(f) of the
Code. None of the Acquired Companies has been, and none of the Acquired
Companies will be, required to include any adjustment in taxable income for any
tax period (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 481 or 263A of the Code or
any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws as a result of
transactions or events occurring, or accounting methods employed, prior to the
Closing. There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
employee or independent contractor or former employee or independent contractor
of any of the Acquired Companies that, considered individually or considered
collectively with any other such Contracts, will, or could reasonably be
expected to, give rise

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount that would not be fully
deductible as a result of Section 280G or Section 162(m) of the Code. There is
no agreement, plan, arrangement or Contract whereby the Company would be
obligated to pay any excise taxes due from any employee of the Company. None of
the Acquired Companies is a party to any Contract to compensate any individual

Companies is, or has ever been, a party to or bound by any tax indemnity
agreement, tax sharing agreement, tax allocation agreement or similar Contract,
including any obligation arising by reason of Treasury Regulations Section

agreement, tax allocation agreement or similar Contract. None of the Acquired
Companies have made any distribution of stock of any "CONTROLLED CORPORATION,"
as that term is defined by Section 355(a)(1) of the Code. Schedule 2.12 lists
(i) all of the Tax positions taken on the Acquired Company Returns for which the
Company did not have "substantial authority" within the meaning of Section 6662,
and (ii) any "reportable transaction" or "listed transaction" within the meaning
of Section 6662A(d) of the Code that the Company has participated in prior to
the Closing Date.

      2.13 EMPLOYEE AND LABOR MATTERS; BENEFIT PLANS.

            (a) Schedule 2.13(a) lists all employee pension benefit plans (as
defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,

3(1) of ERISA), and all other bonus, Stock Option Plan, stock purchase,
incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental retirement, severance,
perquisites, fringe benefits and other similar benefit plans, programs or

identification of those which contain change of control provisions or pending
change of control provisions), written or otherwise, as amended, modified or
supplemented, for the benefit of, or relating to, any domestic former or current
employee, officer, director, independent contractor or consultant (or any of
their beneficiaries) of any Acquired Company or any other Entity (whether or not
incorporated) which is a member of a controlled group which includes any of the
Acquired Companies or which is under common control with any of the Acquired
Companies within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or
Section 4001(a) (14) or (b) of ERISA, as well as each plan with respect to which
any of the Acquired Companies could incur liability under Title IV of ERISA or

Company has Delivered to Parent copies of (i) each such written Company Employee
Plan (or a written description of any Company Employee Plan which is not
written) and all related trust agreements, insurance and other contracts
(including policies), summary plan descriptions, summaries of material
modifications, registration statements (including all attachments), prospectuses
and communications distributed to plan participants, (ii) the three most recent
annual reports on Form 5500 series, with accompanying financial statements,
schedules and attachments, filed with respect to each Company Employee Plan
required to make such a filing, (iii) the most recent actuarial valuation for
each Company Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, (iv) the latest reports

Employee Plan for which the filings described in (ii), (iii) or (iv) above are
not required under ERISA.

            (b)(i) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides
retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person (other than
continuation coverage to the extent required by any Legal Requirement, whether
pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 or
otherwise), and none of the Company Employee Plans is a "multiemployer plan" as
such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" as such term is defined in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA, or a
"voluntary employee beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code; (ii) no party in interest or disqualified person (as
defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) has at any time
engaged in a transaction with respect to any Company

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

Employee Plan which could subject any of the Acquired Companies, directly or
indirectly, to a material tax, penalty or other material liability for
prohibited transactions under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; (iii) no
fiduciary of any Company Employee Plan has breached any of the responsibilities
or obligations imposed upon fiduciaries under Title I of ERISA, which breach
could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect on any of
the Acquired Companies; (iv) all Company Employee Plans have been established
and maintained substantially in accordance with their terms and have operated in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements, and
may by their terms be amended and/or terminated at any time subject to
applicable Legal Requirements and the terms of each Company Employee Plan, and
each of the Acquired Companies has performed all material obligations required
to be performed by them under, and are not in any material respect in default
under or in violation of, any Company Employee Plan, and none of the Acquired
Companies has any Knowledge of any default or violation by any other Person with
respect to, any of the Company Employee Plans; (v) each Company Employee Plan
which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is the
subject of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
(or comparable letter, such as an opinion or notification letter as to the form
of plan adopted by one or more Acquired Companies), and, to the Company's
Knowledge, nothing has occurred which may reasonably be expected to impair such
determination; (vi) all contributions required to be made with respect to any
Company Employee Plan pursuant to Section 412 of the Code, or the terms of the
Company Employee Plan or any collective bargaining agreement, have been made on
or before their due dates (including any extensions thereof); (vii) with respect
to each Company Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the 30-day notice
requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) has
occurred for which there is any material outstanding liability to any Acquired
Company nor would the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the execution of this Agreement) constitute a reportable event for
which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived; and (viii) none of the
Acquired Companies has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any liability
under Title IV of ERISA including, without limitation, any material liability
arising out of or resulting from an event described in Section 4062, 4063 or
4041 of ERISA (other than liability for premium payments to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course). Except as could not
reasonably be expected to result in material liability to any of the Acquired
Companies, no action, claim, suit, lien, litigation, proceeding, arbitral
action, governmental audit, inquiry or investigation relating to any Company
Employee Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) is pending or, to the
Company's Knowledge, is threatened. With respect to each Company Employee Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA,
all claims incurred by the Acquired Companies are (i) insured pursuant to a
contract of insurance whereby the insurance company bears any risk of loss with
respect to such claims, (ii) covered under a contract with a health maintenance
organization (an "HMO") pursuant to which the HMO bears the liability for claims
or (iii) reflected as a liability or accrued for on the Company Financial
Statements.

            (c) No Company Employee Plan is or ever has been subject to Title IV
of ERISA, and no Acquired Company nor any other Entity (whether or not
incorporated) which is a member of a controlled group which includes any of the
Acquired Companies or which is under common control with any of the Acquired
Companies within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) of the Code or
Section 4001(a)(14) or (b) of ERISA has ever sponsored, contributed to, or had
any other liability or potential liability with respect to any plan that is or
was ever subject to Title IV of ERISA.

            (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.13(d), (i) none of the
Acquired Companies has during the last five (5) years maintained an employee
stock ownership plan (within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code) or
any other Company Employee Plan that invests in Company capital stock; (ii)
since December 31, 2001, none of the Acquired Companies has proposed or agreed
to any increase in benefits under any Company Employee Plan (or the creation of
new benefits) or change in employee coverage which could materially increase the
expense of maintaining any Company Employee Plan; (iii) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in an increase in
the amount of compensation or benefits or accelerate the vesting or timing of
payment of any benefits or compensation payable in respect of any employee; (iv)
no person will be entitled to any severance benefits under the terms of any
Company Employee Plan as a result of the consummation of

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (v) none of the Acquired
Companies will be denied an income tax deduction pursuant to Section 162(m) or
280G of the Code.

            (e) Each employee pension benefit plans all employee welfare benefit
plans, and all other bonus, Stock Option Plan, stock purchase, incentive,
deferred compensation, supplemental retirement, severance, perquisites, fringe
benefits and other similar benefit plans, programs or arrangements (including a
specific identification of those which contain change of control provisions or
pending change of control provisions), and any employment, executive
compensation or severance agreements (including a specific identification of
those which contain change of control provisions or pending change of control
provisions), written or otherwise, as amended, modified or supplemented, for the
benefit of, or relating to, any foreign former or current employee, officer,
director, independent contractor or consultant (or any of their beneficiaries)
of any Acquired Company or any other Entity (whether or not incorporated)
covering non-U.S. employees (a "COMPANY INTERNATIONAL PLAN") has been maintained
in substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all applicable Legal Requirements (including any special provisions
relating to registered or qualified plans where such Company International Plan
was intended to so qualify) and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable regulatory authorities. The fair market value of the assets of each
funded Company International Plan, if any, (or the liability of each funded
Company International Plan funded through insurance) is sufficient to procure or
provide for the benefits accrued thereunder through the Effective Time according
to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to the Company International Plan.

            (f) The fiduciary liability insurance policies in effect covering
the fiduciaries of the Company Employee Plans (including the Acquired Companies)
and Company International Plans are set forth on Schedule 2.13(f).

            (g)(i) There are no controversies pending or, to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened, between any of the Acquired Companies and any of their
respective employees, which controversies have had, or could reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect on the Acquired Companies; (ii) none of the Acquired Companies is in
breach of any material collective bargaining agreement or other labor union
contract applicable to persons employed by any of the Acquired Companies. To the
Company's Knowledge, there are no activities or proceedings of any labor unions
to organize employees, or any strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, or
threats thereof, by or with respect to any employees (foreign or domestic) of
any of the Acquired Companies which could reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired
Companies. The Company is not obligated to make any payments or provide any
benefits to any Person under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act of 1988, as amended, or similar state law. With respect to the Acquired
Companies and their current and former employees, there has been no "mass
layoff" or "plant closing" during the prior six months.

            (h) Schedule 2.13(h) identifies each Company Employee Plan that is
or has ever been a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning
of Section 409A of the Code and associated Treasury Department guidance,
including IRS Notice 2005-1. Each such nonqualified deferred compensation plan
has (i) since January 1, 2005, satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3)
and (4) of Section 409A(a) of the Code, and been operated in accordance with
such requirements, and (ii) since October 3, 2004, not been "materially
modified" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and associated Treasury
Department guidance, including IRS Notice 2005-1, Q&A 18.

            (i) The Acquired Companies are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Legal Requirements respecting employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, including, without
limitation, wages and hours, labor relations, employment discrimination,
disability rights or benefits, equal opportunity, plant closure or mass layoff
issues, affirmative action, leaves of absence, occupational health and safety,
workers compensation and unemployment insurance. None of the Acquired Companies
has engaged or is engaging in any unfair labor practice. No unfair labor
practice or labor charge, inquiry, investigation, proceeding or complaint is
pending or, to the Company's

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

Knowledge, threatened with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
before the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or any other Governmental Authority.

            (j) No "leased employee," as that term is defined in Section 414(n)
of the Code, performs services for the Acquired Companies. All persons to whom
the Acquired Companies have made payments for the performance of services during
the three-year period ending on the Closing Date have been properly classified
as employees or non-employees for purposes of federal income and employment tax
withholding and coverage under any of the Company Employee Plans.

      2.14 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Each of the Acquired Companies is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws,
which compliance includes the possession by each of the Acquired Companies of
all permits and other Governmental Authorizations required under applicable
Environmental Laws, and compliance with the terms and conditions thereof. None
of the Acquired Companies has received any notice or other communication (in
writing or otherwise), whether from a Governmental Body, citizens group,
employee or otherwise, that alleges that any of the Acquired Companies is not in
compliance with any Environmental Law, and, to the Company's Knowledge, there
are no circumstances that may prevent or interfere with the compliance by any of
the Acquired Companies with any Environmental Law in the future. Except as to
the Company, to the Company's Knowledge, no current or prior owner of any
property leased or controlled by any of the Acquired Companies has received any
notice or other communication (in writing or otherwise), whether from a
Governmental Body, citizens group, employee or otherwise, that alleges that such
current or prior owner or any of the Acquired Companies is not in compliance
with any Environmental Law. To the Company's Knowledge, all property that is or
has been leased to, controlled by or used by the Acquired Companies, and all
surface water, groundwater and soil associated with or adjacent to such property
is in clean and healthful condition and is free of any material environmental
contamination of any nature and none of the Acquired Companies has any liability
for any clean-up or remediation under any Environmental Law or the exposure of
any individual to Materials of Environmental Concern. All property that is
leased to, controlled by or used by any of the Acquired Companies is free of any
asbestos or asbestos-containing material.

      2.15 REAL PROPERTY.

            (a) Schedule 2.15(a) sets forth a true, correct and complete list of
all real property owned by any Acquired Company (the "OWNED REAL PROPERTY"). The
Acquired Companies have good and marketable title to each of the Owned Real
Properties, free and clear of all liens, charges and encumbrances other than
liens, charges and encumbrances which do not materially interfere with the
Company's use and enjoyment of the Owned Real Properties or materially detract
from or diminish the value thereof. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.15(a),
there are no purchase options, rights of first refusal or similar rights
outstanding with respect to any of the Owned Real Properties. No Acquired
Company has received notice of any pending, and to the Company's Knowledge there
is no threatened, condemnation with respect to any of the Owned Real Properties.
The Company has Delivered to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all
leases pursuant to which any Acquired Company leases all or a portion of any
Owned Real Property to a third party. Each such lease is valid, binding and in
full force and effect. No termination event or condition or uncured default of a
material nature on the part of any Acquired Company or, to the Company's
Knowledge, the tenant thereunder exists under any such lease.

            (b) Schedule 2.15(b) sets forth a true, correct and complete list of
all leases, subleases and other agreements under which any Acquired Company uses
or occupies or has the right to use or occupy, now or in the future, any real
property (the "REAL PROPERTY LEASES"). The Company has Delivered to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of all Real Property Leases (including all
modifications, amendments, supplements, waivers and side letters thereto). Each
Real Property Lease is valid, binding and in full force and effect, all rent and
other sums and charges payable by any Acquired Company as tenants thereunder are
current. No termination event or condition or uncured default of a material
nature on the party of any Acquired Company or, to the Company's Knowledge, the
landlord thereunder exists under any Real Property Lease. Each Acquired Company
has a good and valid leasehold interest in each parcel of real property leased
by it free and clear of all mortgages, pledges, liens, encumbrances and security
interests, except (i) those reflected or reserved against in the current Company
Financial

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

Statements, (ii) Taxes and general and special assessments not in default and
payable without penalty and interest, and (iii) other liens, mortgages, pledges,
encumbrances and security interests which do not materially interfere with any
Acquired Company's use and enjoyment of such real property or materially detract
from or diminish the value thereof. No Acquired Company has received notice of
any pending, nor is there to Company's Knowledge any threatened, condemnation
with respect to any property leased pursuant to any of the Real Property Leases.

      2.16 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS; ORDERS. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.16,
There is no pending Legal Proceeding and, to the Company's Knowledge, no Person
has threatened to commence any Legal Proceeding, that involves any of the
Acquired Companies or any of the assets owned or used by any of the Acquired
Companies. There is no order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree to which any
of the Acquired Companies, or any of the assets owned or used by any of the
Acquired Companies, is subject.

necessary to adopt this Agreement and otherwise approve the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      2.18 NON-CONTRAVENTION; CONSENTS. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.18,

business of any of the Acquired Companies or to any of the assets owned or used
by any of the Acquired Companies, except where the contravention of, conflict
with or violation of, any such terms or requirements could not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired
Companies; or

            (d) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of,
or result in a default under, any provision of any Material Contract, or give
any Person the right to (i) declare a default or exercise any remedy under any
Material Contract, (ii) a rebate, chargeback, penalty or change in delivery
schedule under any Material Contract, (iii) accelerate the maturity or

term of any Material Contract, except in each case where the contravention of,
conflict with, or violation or breach of any such provision could not,

Acquired Companies.

      Except as may be required by the TBCA, the HSR Act and any foreign
antitrust law, none of the Acquired Companies was, is or will be required to
make any filing with or give any notice to, or obtain any Consent from, any
Person in connection with (x) the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement, or (y) the consummation of the Merger or any of the other

to the disclosure required by another section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule

injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.

fact or circumstance, or such event, condition, fact or circumstance had
occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement; and (ii)
any material breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company that, in each

the Company shall, and neither Parent nor the Company shall permit any of their
respective affiliates, Subsidiaries or Representatives to, make any disclosure
regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this

the other party shall have been advised in writing by its outside legal counsel
that such disclosure is required by any applicable Legal Requirement; provided,
however, that no such consultation or agreement shall be required by either
party if, prior to the date of such release or public statement, the Company
shall have withheld, withdrawn, modified or refrained from making its
recommendation in favor of adoption of this Agreement in compliance with Section
5.2(c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the parties
to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that any party to this Agreement (and
any employee, shareholder, representative or other agent of any party hereto)

treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement (the "TRANSACTION") and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) that are provided to the party relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure; provided however that such disclosure may not be
made to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable Legal
Requirement; provided further that (i) the "tax treatment" of the Transaction
means the purported or claimed Tax treatment of the Transaction, and (ii) the
"tax structure" of the Transaction means any fact that may be relevant to
understanding the purported or claimed Tax treatment of the Transaction. The
preceding sentence is intended to cause the Transaction to be treated as not
having been offered under conditions of confidentiality for purposes of Section
1.6011-4(b)(3) (or any successor provision) of the Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 6011 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,

that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

subsequent to the date on which Parent sends Company written notice of such
inaccuracy or breach; or

            (g) by the Company if (i) any of Parent's representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of
this Agreement, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the

inaccuracy or breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.1(g) on account of such inaccuracy or breach until 20 days
subsequent to the date on which Company sends Parent written notice of such
