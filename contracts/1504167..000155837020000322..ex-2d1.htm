 \t\t\tAGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTHIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this
"Agreement") is made and entered into as of January 28, 2020, by and among
BIOPHARMX CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), BITI MERGER SUB,
INC., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and TIMBER PHARMACEUTICALS LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined
in Exhibit A. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tRECITALS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tA. Parent and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with this
Agreement, the DGCL, and the DLLCA. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger
Sub will cease to exist and the Company will become a wholly-owned, limited
liability company subsidiary of Parent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tB. The Parties intend that the Merger constitute a transaction
described in Section 351(a) of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tC. The Parent Board has (i) determined that the Contemplated
Transactions are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Parent and
its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions, including the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock to the members of the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and (iii) determined to recommend, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, that the stockholders of Parent vote
to approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to the members of the
Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tD. The Merger Sub Board has (i) determined that the
Contemplated Transactions are fair to, advisable, and in the best interests of
Merger Sub and its sole stockholder, (ii) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions and (iii) determined to recommend,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, that
the stockholder of Merger Sub vote to adopt this Agreement and thereby approve
the Contemplated Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tE. The Company Managers have (i) determined that the
Contemplated Transactions are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of
the Company and its members, (ii) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions and (iii) determined to recommend,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, that
the members of the Company vote to adopt this Agreement and thereby approve
the Contemplated Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tF. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the Company's willingness to
enter into this Agreement, all of the officers and directors of Parent (who
are listed on Section A of the Company Disclosure Schedule (solely in their
capacity as stockholders of Parent)) are executing support agreements in favor
of the Company in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Parent Stockholder Support Agreement"), pursuant to which such Persons have,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and herein, agreed to
vote all shares of Parent Common Stock of which they are the beneficial owner
(as defined by Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) in favor of the Parent
Stockholder Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tG. It is expected that on the date that Parent holds the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting, the holders of membership interests in the Company
sufficient to adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger as required
under the DLLCA and the Company's Organizational Documents will execute and
deliver an action by written consent adopting this Agreement in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, in order to obtain the Required Company

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1 DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving limited liability
company in the Merger (the "Surviving Entity"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects

promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the second Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.4 Certificate of Formation; Directors, Managers and Officers.
At the Effective Time: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) the Certificate of Formation of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Formation
of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) the limited liability company agreement of the Company as

liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended
as provided by the DLLCA and such limited liability company agreement and as
provided herein; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) the certificate of incorporation of Parent shall be

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) the directors and officers of Parent, each to hold office

shall be designated by the Company, and as set forth in Section 5.11;

  \t\t\t-2-  \t\t

  

Company as set forth in Section 5.11, after giving effect to the provisions of
Section 5.11, or such other persons as shall be mutually agreed upon by Parent
and the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.5 Conversion of Shares and Membership Interests. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
member of the Company or stockholder of Parent; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) The Company Preferred Equity outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
a number of shares of a class of newly issued Parent Preferred Stock which
shall not be convertible to Parent Common Stock but which shall have economic
terms which are substantially the same as the economic terms of the Company
Preferred Equity currently outstanding. The Parties shall negotiate in good
faith prior to filing the Form S-4 with the SEC for the form of Certificate of
Designations with respect to the Parent Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant
to this paragraph. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) The Company Common Equity, together with the Company VARs
specified by the Company pursuant to Exhibit C annexed hereto, outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock and/or options
or warrants to purchase Parent Common Stock equal in the aggregate to the
Timber Allocation Number (the "Merger Consideration"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Exhibit C annexed hereto describes how the Merger
Consideration is to be allocated among shares of stock, options and warrants
of the Parent and among the Company Equity holders including, if elected by
the Company prior to Closing, holders of the Company VARs of the Company
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (with the treatment of
vesting and any such repurchase options or risks of forfeiture, also described
in Exhibit C). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
in connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Equity who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon delivery by
such holder of a Stock Registration Form in accordance with Section 1.7(b) and
any accompanying documents as required therein, be paid in cash the dollar
amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by
multiplying such fraction by the Parent Closing Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) All shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and exchanged for 100% of the membership interests of
the Surviving Entity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the outstanding Units of Company Equity or shares of Parent Common Stock
shall have been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares
or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares
or other like change, the Timber Allocation Number shall, to the extent
necessary, be equitably adjusted to reflect such change to the extent
necessary to provide the holders of Company Equity and Parent Common Stock
with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares or other like change; provided, however,
that nothing herein will be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take
any action with respect to Company Equity or Parent Common Stock,
respectively, that is prohibited or not expressly permitted by the terms of
this Agreement. \t\t

Time: (a) all Company Equity outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be treated in accordance with Exhibit C and all holders of Company
Equity that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as equity holders of the Company; and (b) the
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all Company
Equity outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further
transfer of any such Company Equity shall be made on such transfer books after
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate (if any)
previously representing any Company Equity outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving
Entity, such Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided
in Exhibit C. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.7 Issuance of Certificates. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall deposit
with its transfer agent (the "Exchange Agent"): (i) certificates or evidence
of book-entry shares representing the Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 1.5(a) and Exhibit C and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu
of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(b). The Parent Common
Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any
dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such
shares, are referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund." \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Parties shall cause
the holders of Company Equity listed on Exhibit C to deliver to the Exchange
Agent a completed and executed Stock Registration Form in the form of Exhibit
D. Upon delivery of each Stock Registration Form to the Exchange Agent (A)
the holder of such Company Equity shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate or certificates or book-entry shares representing the
Merger Consideration (in a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock) that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section
1.5(a) and Exhibit C (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5(b)). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t1.8 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is determined by the Surviving Entity to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Entity with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property
of the Company, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Entity shall
be fully authorized, and shall use their and its commercially reasonable
efforts (in the name of the Company, in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of
the Surviving Entity and otherwise) to take such action. \t\t

or required to be contributed to, by the Company or any Company ERISA
Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employee, director, officer
or independent contractor of the Company or under which the Company has any
actual or contingent liability (including, without limitation, as to the
result of it being treated as a single employer under Code Section 414 with
any other person). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) As applicable with respect to each material Benefit Plan,
the Company has made available to Parent, true and complete copies of (i) each

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Each Benefit Plan has been maintained, operated and

Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Each Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and which is intended to
meet the qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code has received
a determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS to the effect that such
plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and the related trust is
exempt from federal income Taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code,
respectively, and nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the qualification of such Benefit Plan or the tax
exempt status of the related trust. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate
maintains, contributes to, is required to contribute to, or has any actual or
contingent liability with respect to, (i) any "employee pension benefit plan"

(within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA), (iii) any "multiple employer
plan" (within the meaning of Section 413 of the Code) or (iv) any "multiple

 \t\t\t(g) Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate, nor to
the Knowledge of the Company, any fiduciary, trustee or administrator of any
Benefit Plan, has engaged in, or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will engage in, any transaction with respect to
any Benefit Plan which would subject any such Benefit Plan, the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or Company ERISA Affiliates or Parent to a material Tax,
material penalty or material liability for a "prohibited transaction" under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) No Benefit Plan provides death, medical, dental, vision,
life insurance or other welfare benefits beyond termination of service or
retirement other than coverage mandated by Law. Section 2.17(h) of

 \t\t

obligations to existing and previously terminated employees and service

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Neither the execution of, nor the performance of the

becoming due to any current or former employee, director, officer, or

result in the acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of any

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Neither the execution of, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or when combined
with the occurrence of any other event, including without limitation, a
termination of employment) will result in the receipt or retention by any
person who is a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Code Section
280G) of any payment or benefit that is or could be characterized as an excess
"parachute payment" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G), determined
without regard to the application of Code Section 280G(b)(5). \t\t

 \t\t

been and can never be less than the fair market value of the underlying
Company membership interest as of the grant date of such Company Option. Each
Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the
meaning of Code Section 409A) complies and has at all times been in
documentary and operational compliance with Code Section 409A and IRS
regulations issued thereunder, except as would not be reasonably expected to
result in material liability to the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

of the Company, any union organizing activity. \t\t

accurate and complete copies of all registration statements, proxy statements,
Certifications (as defined below) and other statements, reports, schedules,
forms and other documents filed by Parent with the SEC since January 31, 2016
(the "Parent SEC Documents"), other than such documents that can be obtained
on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. All material statements, reports,
schedules, forms and other documents required to have been filed by Parent or
its officers with the SEC have been so filed on a timely basis. As of the time
it was filed with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), each of the
Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act or the

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-23-  \t\t

  

Exchange Act (as the case may be) and, as of the time they were filed, none of
the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The certifications and statements
required by (i) Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act and (ii) 18 U.S.C. §1350
(Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) relating to the Parent SEC Documents
(collectively, the "Certifications") are accurate and complete and comply as
to form and content with all applicable Laws. As used in this Section 3.7, the
term "file" and variations thereof shall be broadly construed to include any
manner in which a document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise
made available to the SEC. Except as set forth in Section 3.7 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, the Parent has never been and is not currently an issuer
as such term is described in Rule 144(i) of the Securities Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The financial statements (including any related notes)
contained or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Documents: (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial
statements or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, except as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, and except that the unaudited financial
statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments none of which are material) applied on a consistent basis
unless otherwise noted therein throughout the periods indicated; and (iii)
fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of Parent and
its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the results of
operations and cash flows of Parent for the periods covered thereby. Other
than as expressly disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the
date hereof, there has been no material change in Parent's or its
Subsidiaries' accounting methods or principles that would be required to be
disclosed in Parent's financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The books
of account and other financial records of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
are true and complete in all material respects. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable current listing and governance rules and regulations of the NYSE
American Exchange and has not received any written notice that it is not in
compliance with all current listing and governance rules and regulations of
NYSE American Exchange, except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Parent maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and to provide reasonable
assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that
receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the Parent Board and (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parent's
assets that could have a material effect on Parent's financial statements.
Parent has evaluated the effectiveness of Parent's internal control over
financial reporting as of January 31, 2019, and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q (or any amendment thereto) its conclusions
about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of
the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting, to Parent's auditors and audit
committee (and made available to the Company a summary of the significant
aspects of such disclosure) (A) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses, if any, in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any known fraud that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parent's internal control over financial reporting. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Parent maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
Parent in the periodic reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time
periods, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to
Parent's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the Certifications. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.8 Absence of Changes. Except as set forth on Section 3.8 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, between the date of the Parent Balance Sheet
and the date of this Agreement, the Parent has conducted its business only in
the Ordinary Course of Business (except for the execution and performance of
this Agreement and the discussions, negotiations and transactions related
thereto) and there has not been any (a) Parent Material Adverse Effect or (b)
action, event or occurrence that would have required the consent of Parent
pursuant to Section 4.2(b) had such action, event or occurrence taken place
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.9 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. As of the date hereof,
Parent does not have any Liability, individually or in the aggregate, of a
type required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet or disclosed in
the footnotes thereto under GAAP except for: (a) Liabilities disclosed,
reflected or reserved against in the Parent Balance Sheet; (b) Liabilities
that have been incurred by Parent since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet
in the Ordinary Course of Business and which are not in excess of $10,000; (c)
Liabilities for performance of obligations of Parent under Parent Contracts;
(d) Liabilities incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions; (e)
Liabilities which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to Parent; and (f) Liabilities described in Section
3.9 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.10 Title to Assets. The Parent owns, and has good and valid
title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold
interests in, all tangible properties or tangible assets and equipment used or
held for use in its business or operations or purported to be owned by it,
including: (a) all assets reflected on the Parent Balance Sheet; and (b) all
other assets reflected in the books and records of the Parent as being owned
by the Parent. All of such assets are owned or, in the case of leased assets,
leased by the Parent free and clear of any Encumbrances, other than Permitted
Encumbrances. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.11 Real Property; Leasehold. Parent does not own any real

complete list of all real properties with respect to which Parent directly or
indirectly holds a valid leasehold interest as well as any other real estate
that is in the possession of or leased by Parent, and (b) copies of all leases
under which any such real property is possessed (the "Parent Real Estate
Leases"), each of which is in full force and effect, with no existing material
default thereunder. Parent's use and operation of each such leased property
conforms to all applicable Laws in all material respects, and Parent has
exclusive possession of each such leased property and has not granted any
occupancy rights to tenants or licensees with respect to such leased property.
In addition, each such leased property is free and clear of all Encumbrances
other than Permitted Encumbrances. Parent has not received written notice from
its landlords or any Governmental Body that: (i) relates to violations of
building, zoning, safety or fire ordinances or regulations; (ii) claims any
defect or deficiency with respect to any of such properties; or (iii) requests
the performance of any repairs, alterations or other work to such
properties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.12 Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Parent owns, or has the legal and valid right to use,
as currently being used by the Parent, all Parent IP Rights, and with respect
to Parent IP Rights that are owned by the Parent, has the right to bring
actions for the infringement of such Parent IP Rights, in each case except
subject to the terms of the license agreements set forth on Section 3.12(c) of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule for any failure to own, have such rights to
use, or have such rights to bring actions for infringement. \t\t

registered Copyrights, and registered Trademarks (including domain names) and
all applications for any of the foregoing, (ii) to the Knowledge of the
Parent, all Parent IP Rights that are exclusively licensed to the Parent that

owner(s) of record (and, in the case of domain names, the registrar),
jurisdiction of application and/or registration, the application and/or
registration number, the date of application and/or registration, and the
status of application and/or registration. To the Knowledge of the Parent,
each item of Parent IP Rights that is Parent Registered IP is and at all times
has been filed and maintained in compliance with all applicable Law and all
filings, payments, and other actions required to be made or taken to maintain
such item of Parent Registered IP in full force and effect have been made by
the applicable deadline. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Section 3.12(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
accurately identifies (i) all material Parent Contracts pursuant to which

software that (1) is so licensed solely in executable or object code form
pursuant to a non-exclusive, internal use software license and other
Intellectual Property associated with such software and (2) is not
incorporated into, or material to the development, manufacturing, or
distribution of, any of the Parent's products or services, (B) any
Intellectual Property licensed ancillary to the purchase or use of equipment,
reagents or other materials and (C) any confidential information provided
under confidentiality agreements), and (ii) whether the license or licenses
granted to the Parent are exclusive or non-exclusive. For purposes of greater
certainty, the term "license" in this Section 3.12(c) and in Section 3.12(d)
includes any license, sublicense, covenant, non-assert, consent, release or
waiver. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Section 3.12(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
accurately identifies each material Parent Contract pursuant to which the
Parent has granted any license under, or any right (whether or not currently
exercisable) or interest in, any Parent IP Rights to any Person (other than
any Parent IP Rights non-exclusively licensed to suppliers or service
providers for the sole purpose of enabling such suppliers or service providers
to provide services for the Parent's benefit). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(e) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, the Parent is not bound by, and no Parent IP Rights are
subject to, any Parent Contract containing any covenant or other provision, or
any judicial, administrative or arbitral order, judgment, award, order,
decree, injunction, settlement or stipulation, that in any way limits or
restricts the ability of the Parent to use, exploit, assert, enforce, sell,
transfer or dispose of any such Parent IP Rights anywhere in the world, in
each case, in a manner that would materially limit the business of the Parent
as currently conducted or planned to be conducted. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Except as identified in Section 3.12(f) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, the Parent is the sole and unrestricted legal and
beneficial owner of all right, title, and interest to and in Parent IP Rights
(other than (i) Parent IP Rights exclusively and non-exclusively licensed to
the Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, as identified in Section 3.12(c) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, (ii) any non-customized software that (A) is
licensed to the Parent solely in executable or object code form pursuant to a
non-exclusive, internal use software license and other Intellectual Property
associated with such software and (B) is not incorporated into, or material to
the development, manufacturing, or distribution of, any of the Parent's or any
of its Subsidiaries' products or services and (iii) any Intellectual Property
licensed ancillary to the purchase or use of equipment, reagents or other
materials), in each case, free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Each Person who is or was an employee or contractor of the
Parent and who is or was involved in the creation or development of any Parent
IP Rights has signed a valid, enforceable agreement containing an assignment
of such Intellectual Property to the Parent and confidentiality provisions
protecting confidential information of the Parent and Parent has no reason to
believe that any such Person is unwilling to provide Parent with cooperation
as may reasonably be required to complete or prosecute all Parent IP
Rights. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) No current nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, former member,
officer, director, or employee of the Parent has any claim, right (whether or
not currently exercisable), or interest to or in any Parent IP Rights
purported to be owned by the Parent. To the Knowledge of the Parent, no
employee of the Parent is (a) bound by or otherwise subject to any Contract
restricting him or her from performing his or her duties for the Parent or (b)
in breach of any Contract with any former employer or other Person concerning
Parent IP Rights purported to be owned by the Parent or confidentiality
provisions protecting Trade Secrets and confidential information comprising
Parent IP Rights purported to be owned by the Parent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Except as identified in Section 3.12(f)(iii) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, no Parent IP Rights were developed, in whole or in part
(A) pursuant to or in connection with the development of any professional,
technical or industry standard, (B) under contract with or using the resources
of any Governmental Body, academic institution or other entity that would
subject any Parent IP Rights to the rights of any Governmental Body, academic
institution or other entity or (C) under any grants or other funding
arrangements with third parties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) The Parent has taken all commercially reasonable and
appropriate steps to protect and maintain the Parent IP Rights, including to
preserve the confidentiality of all proprietary information that the Parent
holds, or purports to hold, as a material Trade Secret. Any disclosure by the
Parent of Trade Secrets to any third party has been pursuant to the terms of a
written agreement with such Person or is otherwise lawful. Parent has
implemented and maintained a reasonable security plan consistent with industry
practices of companies offering similar products or services. Parent has not
experienced any breach of security or otherwise unauthorized access by third
parties to the confidential information in Parent's possession, custody or
control \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v) The Parent has not assigned or otherwise transferred ownership
of, or agreed to assign or otherwise transfer ownership of, any Parent IP
Rights owned or purported to be owned by or exclusively licensed to the Parent
to any other Person. As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in
Section 3.12(f)(v) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Parent has not sold
or otherwise transferred (other than standard licenses or rights to use
granted to customers, suppliers or service providers in the Ordinary Course of
Business) any of the Parent IP Rights to any third party, and there exists no
obligation by the Parent to assign or otherwise transfer any of the Parent IP
Rights to any third party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi) To the Knowledge of the Parent, (i) the Parent IP Rights are
valid and enforceable and (ii) constitute all Intellectual Property necessary
for the Parent to conduct its business as currently conducted and planned to
be conducted. Parent has not misrepresented, or failed to disclose, any facts
or circumstances in any application for any Parent IP Rights that would
constitute fraud with respect to such application. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) To the Knowledge of the Parent, the manufacture, marketing,
license, sale or intended use of any product or technology currently licensed
or sold or under development by the Parent does not violate any license or
agreement between the Parent or its Subsidiaries and any third party, and does
not infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property right of any third
party. Parent has not been sued in any action, suit or proceeding, or received
any written communications alleging that any Parent IP Rights or product or
past activity has violated or would violate any Intellectual Property rights
of any third party and to the Parent's knowledge a valid claim for such
action, suit or proceeding does not exist. No Parent IP Rights are subject to
any proceeding,

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-27-  \t\t

  

order, judgment, settlement agreement, stipulation or right that restricts in
any manner the use, transfer, or licensing thereof by Parent, or which may
affect the validity, use or enforceability of any such Parent IP Rights. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) To the Knowledge of the Parent, no third party is
infringing upon any Parent IP Rights or violating any license or agreement
between the Parent and such third party, and the Parent have not sent any
written communication to or asserted or threatened in writing any action or
claim against any Person involving or relating to any Parent IP Rights \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) There is no current or pending Legal Proceeding
(including, but not limited to, opposition, interference, inter partes review,
or other proceeding in any patent or other government office) contesting the
validity, ownership or right to use, sell, license or dispose of any Parent IP
Rights or products or technologies, nor has the Parent received any written
notice asserting or suggesting that any such Parent IP Rights, or the Parent's
right to use, sell, license or dispose of any such Parent IP Rights or
products or technologies conflicts with or infringes or misappropriates or
will conflict with or infringe or misappropriate the rights of any other
Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Except as set forth in the Contracts listed on Section
3.12(j) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and except for Parent Contracts
entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business, (i) the Parent is not bound
by any Contract to indemnify, defend, hold harmless, or reimburse any other
Person with respect to any Intellectual Property infringement,
misappropriation, or similar claim, in each case, that would reasonably be
expected to be material to the Parent or its business, and (ii) the Parent has
never assumed, or agreed to discharge or otherwise take responsibility for,
any existing or potential liability of another Person for infringement,
misappropriation, or violation of any Intellectual Property right, which
assumption, agreement or responsibility is material and remains in force as of
the date of this Agreement. \t\t

accurate and complete copies of all Contracts to which Parent is a party or by
which it is bound of the type described in the foregoing clauses (i)-(xiii)
(any such Contract, a "Parent Material Contract"). There are no Parent
Material Contracts that are not in written form. Parent has not nor, to
Parent's Knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, has any other party to a
Parent Material Contract, breached, violated or defaulted under, or received
notice that it breached, violated or defaulted under, any of the terms or
conditions of any Parent Material Contract in such manner as would permit any
other party to cancel or terminate any such Parent Material Contract, or would
permit any other party to seek damages which would reasonably be expected to
be material to Parent or its business. As to Parent, as of the date of this
Agreement, each Parent Material Contract is valid, binding, enforceable and in
full force and effect, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. No Person is
renegotiating, or has a right pursuant to the terms of any Parent Material

 \t\t

any other similar Law administered or promulgated by the FDA or other Drug
Regulatory Agency, except

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-29-  \t\t

  

for any noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate, which would
not be material to Parent. No investigation, claim, suit, proceeding, audit or
other action by any Governmental Body is pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent. There is no agreement, judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding upon Parent which (i) has or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially
impairing any business practice of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, any
acquisition of material property by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the
conduct of business by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted (ii) is reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on Parent's
ability to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation under this
Agreement, or (iii) is reasonably likely to have the effect of preventing,
delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering with the Contemplated
Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

Parent Permits. No Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened, which seeks to revoke, limit, suspend, or materially modify any
Parent Permit. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) There are no proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened with respect to an alleged material violation by Parent of
the FDCA, FDA regulations adopted thereunder, the Controlled Substance Act or
any other similar Law administered or promulgated by any Drug Regulatory
Agency. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Parent and each Subsidiary holds all required Governmental
Authorizations issuable by any Drug Regulatory Agency necessary or material to
the conduct of the business of the Company or such Subsidiary as currently
conducted, and, as applicable, the development, clinical testing,
manufacturing, marketing, distribution and importation or exportation, as
currently conducted, of any of its products or product candidates
(collectively, the "Parent Products") (collectively, the "Parent Regulatory
Permits") and no such Parent Regulatory Permit has been (i) revoked,
withdrawn, suspended, cancelled or terminated or (ii) modified in any adverse
manner. Parent and each Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects
with the Parent Regulatory Permits and has not received any written notice or
other written communication, or to the Knowledge of Parent and each
Subsidiary, any other communication from any Drug Regulatory Agency regarding
(A) any material violation of or failure to comply materially with any term or
requirement of any Parent Regulatory Permit or (B) any revocation, withdrawal,
suspension, cancellation, termination or material modification of any Parent
Regulatory Permit. Parent has made available to Company all information
relating to the Parent Products and the development, clinical testing,
manufacturing, importation and exportation of the Parent Products, including
complete copies of the following (to the extent there are any): (x) copies of
all investigational new drug applications (INDs) submitted to the FDA, and all
supplements to and amendments of such INDs; new drug applications; adverse
event reports; clinical study reports and material study data; inspection
reports, notices of adverse findings, warning letters, filings and letters and
other material written correspondence to and from any Drug Regulatory Agency;

letters, filings, correspondence and meeting minutes with any other
Governmental Body. Parent and each Subsidiary has complied in all material
respects with the ICH E9 Guidance for Industry: Statistical Principles for
Clinical Trials in the management of the clinical data that have been
presented to the Parent. To the Knowledge of Parent and each Subsidiary, there
are no facts that would be reasonably likely to result in any warning,
untitled or notice of violation letter or Form FDA-483 from the FDA. Neither
Parent nor any Subsidiary is aware of any studies, tests or trials the results
of which Parent or any Subsidiary believes reasonably call into question (i)

to review such notice and may request additional information or documents as

Company Material Agreement or proposed amendment to a Company Material
Agreement if Parent does not respond to the Company by the end of such three
(3) Business Day period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.3 Access and Investigation. Subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which the Parties agree will continue in full force
following the date of this Agreement, during the Pre-Closing Period, upon
reasonable notice, Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, shall and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Party's Representatives to: (a) provide the other Party and such other Party's
Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to such
Party's Representatives, personnel, property and assets and to all existing
books, records, Tax Returns, work papers and other documents and information
relating to such Party; (b) provide the other Party and such other Party's

information regarding such Party as the other Party may reasonably request;
(c) permit the other Party's officers and other employees to meet, upon
reasonable notice and during normal business hours, with the chief financial
officer and other officers and managers of such Party responsible for such
Party's financial statements and the internal controls of such Party to
discuss such matters as the other Party may deem necessary or appropriate and;
(d) make available to the other Party copies of unaudited financial
statements, material operating and financial reports prepared for senior
management or the board of directors or managers of such Party, and any
material notice, report or other document filed with or sent to or received
from any Governmental Body in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.
Any investigation conducted by either Parent or the Company pursuant to this
Section 4.3 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the conduct of the business of the other Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may restrict the foregoing
access to the extent that any Law applicable to such Party requires such Party
to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information or as may
be necessary to preserve the attorney-client privilege under any circumstances
in which such privilege may be jeopardized by such disclosure or access. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.4 Parent Non-Solicitation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Parent agrees that, during the Pre-Closing Period, neither
it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall it or any of its Subsidiaries
authorize any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage, induce, discuss, negotiate or facilitate the
communication, making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry or take any action that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (ii) furnish any non-
public information regarding Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person
in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry; (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-41-  \t\t

  

(subject to Section 5.3); (v) execute or enter into any letter of intent or
any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition
Transaction; or (vi) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 4.4 and
subject to compliance with this Section 4.4, prior to obtaining the Required
Parent Stockholder Vote, Parent may furnish non-public information regarding
Parent and its Subsidiaries to, and enter into discussions or negotiations
with, any Person in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by
such Person which the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with Parent's outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Offer
(and is not withdrawn) if: (A) neither Parent nor any of its Representatives
shall have breached this Section 4.4 in any material respect, (B) the Parent
Board concludes in good faith based on the advice of outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board under applicable Law; (C) Parent
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
provisions (including nondisclosure provisions, use restrictions, non-
solicitation provisions and no hire provisions) at least as favorable to
Parent as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; and (D)
substantially contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information
to such Person, Parent furnishes such nonpublic information to the Company (to
the extent such information has not been previously furnished by Parent to the
Company). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any Representative of Parent
(whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Parent)
takes any action that, if taken by Parent, would constitute a breach of this
Section 4.4, the taking of such action by such Representative shall be deemed
to constitute a breach of this Section 4.4 by Parent for purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may, as set forth in Section
5.3 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, continue to solicit potential bidders
who might have an interest in acquiring its \'01 and its \'04 programs
provided that Parent receives from any potential bidder a confidentiality
agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent keeps the
Company fully informed of the status of all such negotiations, including but
not limited to advising the Company orally (and promptly thereafter in
writing) of any proposal for the purchase of any such interest in its '01
and/or '04 programs (including the identity of any person making or
submitting a proposal for the acquisition of any such interest and the terms
of such a proposal, as well as any material modifications of any such
proposal), and no contract for the sale of the assets related to the '01
and/or '04 programs may be entered into nor consummated without the written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If Parent or any Representative of Parent receives an
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry at any time during the Pre-Closing
Period, then Parent shall promptly (and in no event later than two Business
Day after Parent becomes aware of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry) advise the Company orally (and promptly thereafter in writing) of
such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of
the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry, and the material terms thereof). Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed with respect to the status and material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and any material modification or
proposed material modification thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Parent shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any Person that
relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry as of the date of
this Agreement and request the destruction or return of any nonpublic
information of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries provided to such
Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.5 Company Non-Solicitation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Company agrees that, during the Pre-Closing Period,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall it or any of its
Subsidiaries authorize any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly:
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce, discuss, negotiate or
facilitate the communication,

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-42-  \t\t

  

making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry or take any action that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (ii) furnish any non-public
information regarding the Company to any Person in connection with or in
response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (iii) engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal (subject to Section 5.2); (v) execute or enter into any
letter of intent or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Transaction; or (vi) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Section
4.5 and subject to compliance with this Section 4.5, prior to obtaining the
Required Company Member Vote, the Company may furnish non-public information
regarding the Company to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, any
Person in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such Person
which the Company Managers determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Company's outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Offer (and is
not withdrawn) if: (A) neither the Company nor any of its Representatives
shall have breached this Section 4.5 in any material respect, (B) the Company
Managers conclude in good faith based on the advice of outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the Company Managers under applicable Law; (C)
the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement
containing provisions (including nondisclosure provisions, use restrictions,
non-solicitation provisions and no hire provisions) at least as favorable to
the Company as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; and (D)
substantially contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information
to such Person, the Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to
the extent such information has not been previously furnished by the Company
to Parent). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any Representative of the Company
(whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company) takes any action that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a
breach of this Section 4.5, the taking of such action by such Representative
shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 4.5 by the Company for
purposes of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If the Company or any Representative of the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry at any time during the
Pre-Closing Period, then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later
than one Business Day after the Company becomes aware of such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) advise Parent orally and in writing of such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the
Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,
and the material terms thereof). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status and material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and any material modification or proposed
material modification thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any
Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry as of
the date of this Agreement and request the destruction or return of any
nonpublic information of the Company provided to such Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.6 Notification of Certain Matters. (a) During the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company shall promptly notify Parent (and, if in writing, furnish
copies of) if any of the following occurs: (i) any notice or other
communication is received from any Person alleging that the Consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with any of the Contemplated
Transactions; (ii) any Legal Proceeding against or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company is commenced, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any

aware of any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement; or (iv) the failure of the Company to comply with any covenant or
obligation of the Company; in each case that could reasonably be expected to

7

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-43-  \t\t

  

and 8, as applicable, impossible or materially less likely. No notification

affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of the
Company contained in this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule for
purposes of Sections 6, 7 and 8, as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall promptly notify

alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with any of the Contemplated Transactions; (ii) any Legal Proceeding against

any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement; or (iv) the
failure of Parent to comply with any covenant or obligation of Parent; in each

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.1 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Parties shall prepare, and Parent shall cause to be filed with
the SEC, the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. Parent represents, covenants and agrees that the
Proxy Statement, including any pro forma financial statements included therein
(and the letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy included
therewith) will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The Company represents, covenants and agrees
that the information provided by the Company to Parent for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement (including the Company Financials) will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make such information not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no covenant, representation or
warranty with respect to statements made in the Proxy Statement (and the
letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy included
therewith), if any, based on information provided by the Company or any of its
Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. The Company and its legal
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC (at least three (3) business days prior to the
filing thereof), and on the response to any comments of the SEC on the Proxy
Statement, prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC, to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff and to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC. Each
of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to Parent's stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Each Party shall promptly furnish to the other Party all information
concerning such Party and such Party's Affiliates and such Party's
stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with
any action contemplated by this Section 5.1. If Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company become aware of any event or information that, pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, should be disclosed in an amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement, as the case may
be, then such Party, as the case

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-44-  \t\t

  

may be, shall promptly inform the other Parties thereof and shall cooperate
with such other Parties in filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC
and, if appropriate, in mailing such amendment or supplement to the Parent
stockholders. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and
provide, and require its Representatives to provide, Parent and its
Representatives, with all true, correct and complete information regarding the
Company that is required by Law to be included in the Registration Statement
or reasonably requested by Parent to be included in the Registration
Statement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a consent letter of the
Company's independent accounting firm that is customary in scope and substance
for consent letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.2 Company Member Written Consent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) On or prior to the date of the Parent Stockholders'
Meeting, the Company shall obtain the approval by written consent from Company
members sufficient for the Required Company Member Vote in lieu of a meeting
pursuant to Section 12-302 of the DLLCA, for purposes of adopting and
approving this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. Under no
circumstances shall the Company assert that any other approval or consent is
necessary by its members to approve this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Company agrees that: (i) the Company Managers shall
recommend that the Company's members vote to adopt and approve this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions and shall use reasonable best efforts to
solicit such approval within the time set forth in Section 5.2(a) (the
recommendation of the Company Managers that the Company's members vote to
adopt and approve this Agreement being referred to as the "Company Managers
Recommendation"); and (ii) the Company Managers Recommendation shall not be
withdrawn or modified (and the Company Managers shall not publicly propose to
withdraw or modify the Company Managers Recommendation) in a manner adverse to
Parent, and no resolution by the Company Managers or any committee thereof to
withdraw or modify the Company Managers Recommendation in a manner adverse to
Parent or to adopt, approve or recommend (or publicly propose to adopt,
approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal shall be adopted or proposed
(the actions set forth in the foregoing clause (ii), collectively, a "Company
Managers Adverse Recommendation Change"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 5.2(b), and subject to compliance with Section 4.5 and Section 5.2, if
at any time prior to the approval of the Required Parent Stockholder Matters
by the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, the Company receives a bona fide
written Superior Offer, the Company Managers may make a Company Managers
Adverse Recommendation Change if, but only if, following the receipt of and on
account of such Superior Offer, (i) the Company Managers determine in good
faith, based on the advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make a Company Managers Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii)
the Company has, and has caused its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel to, during the Company Notice Period (as defined below), negotiate
with Parent in good faith (if Parent so desires) to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Offer, and (iii) if after Parent shall have
delivered to the Company a written offer to alter the terms or conditions of
this Agreement during the Company Notice Period, the Company Managers shall
have determined in good faith, based on the advice of its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the Company
Managers Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (after taking into account such
alterations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement); provided that
Parent receives written notice from the Company confirming that the Company
Managers have determined to change their recommendation at least four Business
Days in advance of such Company Managers Adverse Recommendation Change, (the
"Company Notice Period"), which notice shall

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-45-  \t\t

  

include written copies of any relevant proposed transaction agreements with
any party making a potential Superior Offer. In the event of any material
amendment to any Superior Offer, the Company shall be required to provide
Parent with notice of such material amendment and the Company Notice Period
shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two Business Days
remain in the Company Notice Period following such notification during which
the Parties shall comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.3(c)
and the Company Managers shall not make a Company Managers Adverse
Recommendation Change prior to the end of such Company Notice Period as so
extended. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.3 Parent Stockholders' Meeting. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Parent shall take all action necessary under applicable Law
to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Parent Common
Stock to consider and vote to (i) approve the issuance of the shares of Parent
Common Stock to the members of the Company pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (the "Share Issuance Proposal"), (ii) approve the change of the
corporate name of Parent (the "Name Change Proposal"), (iii) approve the
reverse stock split of the Company (the "Reverse Stock Split Proposal"), (iv)
approve, if required, (a) the terms of the Parent Preferred Stock to be issued
to the current holders of the preferred membership interests of the Company
and (b) the issuance of Parent Common Stock underlying the warrants, if any,
being issued to any financing sources related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (v) approve such other matters as are determined to be
required to complete the Closing (collectively, the "Parent Stockholder
Matters" and such meeting, the "Parent Stockholders' Meeting"). The Parent
Stockholders' Meeting shall be held as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent
shall take reasonable measures to ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Parent Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance
with all applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if on the date of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, or a date
preceding the date on which the Parent Stockholders' Meeting is scheduled,
Parent reasonably believes that (i) it will not receive proxies sufficient to
obtain the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, whether or not a quorum would be
present or (ii) it will not have sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
represented (whether in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, Parent shall
postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of, the Parent Stockholders' Meeting as long as the date of the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than an
aggregate of 60 calendar days in connection with any postponements or
adjournments. Parent agrees that in connection with the reverse stock split,
it will obtain the consent of the Company prior to (a) fixing any range for
the reverse split to be approved by Parent's shareholders and (b) setting a
final reverse stock split ratio to be effected by the Parent. Parent shall
retain, and be responsible for the fees and expenses of, a nationally-
recognized proxy solicitor, to be retained for the purpose of the solicitation
of votes at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting and any postponements or
adjournments thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Parent agrees that, subject to Section 5(c): (i) the Parent
Board shall recommend that the holders of Parent Common Stock vote to approve
the Parent Stockholder Matters, (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Parent Board recommends that Parent's
stockholders vote to approve the Parent Stockholder Matters (the
recommendation of the Parent Board being referred to as the "Parent Board
Recommendation"); and (iii) the Parent Board Recommendation shall not be
withheld, amended, withdrawn or modified (and the Parent Board shall not
publicly propose to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the Parent Board
Recommendation) in a manner adverse to the Company (the actions set forth in
the foregoing clause (iii), collectively, a "Parent Board Adverse
Recommendation Change"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 5.3(b), and subject to compliance with Section 4.4 and Section 5.3, if
at any time prior to the approval of the Required Parent Stockholder Matters
by the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, Parent receives a bona fide written
Superior Offer,

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-46-  \t\t

  

the Parent Board may make a Parent Board Adverse Recommendation Change if, but
only if, following the receipt of and on account of such Superior Offer, (i)
the Parent Board determines in good faith, based on the advice of its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to make a Parent Board Adverse Recommendation
Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (ii) Parent has, and has caused its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel to, during the Parent Notice Period (as defined
below), negotiate with the Company in good faith (if the Company so desires)
to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Offer, and (iii) if
after the Company shall have delivered to Parent a written offer to alter the
terms or conditions of this Agreement during the Parent Notice Period, the
Parent Board shall have determined in good faith, based on the advice of its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify
the Parent Board Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (after taking into account such
alterations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement); provided that the
Company receives written notice from Parent confirming that the Parent Board
has determined to change its recommendation at least four Business Days in
advance of such Parent Board Adverse Recommendation Change, (the "Parent
Notice Period"), which notice shall include written copies of any relevant
proposed transaction agreements with any party making a potential Superior
Offer. In the event of any material amendment to any Superior Offer, Parent
shall be required to provide the Company with notice of such material
amendment and the Parent Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to
ensure that at least two Business Days remain in the Parent Notice Period
following such notification during which the Parties shall comply again with
the requirements of this Section 5.3(c) and the Parent Board shall not make a
Parent Board Adverse Recommendation Change prior to the end of such Parent
Notice Period as so extended. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent
or the Parent Board from (i) complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or (iii) otherwise making any disclosure to
the Parent stockholders; provided however, that in the case of the foregoing
clause (iii) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to make such disclosure would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law, including its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, further, that any such
disclosures (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed to be a change of the Parent Board Recommendation unless
the Parent Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Parent Board Recommendation
(i) in such communication or (ii) within three Business Days after being
requested in writing to do so by the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.4 Regulatory Approvals. Each Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to file or otherwise submit, as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, all applications, notices, reports and other documents
reasonably required to be filed by such Party with or otherwise submitted by
such Party to any Governmental Body with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by
any such Governmental Body. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.5 Employee Benefits. For purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate, and level of benefits under the benefit plans, programs,
contracts or arrangements of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing, the Surviving Entity) providing benefits to any
Continuing Employee after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Plans"), each
employee who continues to be employed by the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing ("Continuing
Employees") shall be credited with his or her years of service with Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of each Post-
Closing Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to a Continuing Employee, Parent shall cause

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-47-  \t\t

  

all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such Post-Closing Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents except to the extent such conditions would not have
been waived or satisfied under the employee benefit plan whose coverage is
being replaced under the Post-Closing Plan, and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by a Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of such plan
year in which coverage is replaced with coverage under a Post-Closing Plan to
be taken into account under such Post-Closing Plan with respect to the plan
year in which participation in such Post-Closing Plan begins for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
such plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Post-
Closing Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of
the date on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the Surviving
Entity shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director, manager, officer, fiduciary or agent of Parent or the
Company, respectively (the "DandO Indemnified Parties"), against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements (collectively, "Costs"),
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the DandO Indemnified Party is or
was a director, manager, officer, fiduciary or agent of Parent or of the
Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
in each case, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. Each DandO
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each
of Parent and the Surviving Entity, jointly and severally, upon receipt by
Parent or the Surviving Entity from the DandO Indemnified Party of a request
therefor; provided that any such person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to Parent, to the extent then required by the DGCL, to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to indemnification. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The provisions of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Parent with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors and officers of Parent that are
presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent
shall not be amended, modified or repealed for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were officers or
directors of Parent. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Entity shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity to so contain, provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors and officers as those presently
set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) From and after the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Entity
shall fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company to its
DandO Indemnified Parties as of immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to any
indemnification provisions under the Company's Organizational Documents and
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and such DandO
Indemnified Parties, with respect to claims arising out of matters occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) Parent shall fulfill and honor in
all respects the obligations of Parent to its DandO Indemnified Parties as of
immediately prior to the Closing pursuant to any indemnification provisions
under Parent's Organizational Documents and pursuant to any indemnification
agreements between Parent and such DandO Indemnified Parties, with respect to
claims arising out of matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-48-  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, with an effective date
as of the Closing Date, on commercially available terms and conditions and
with coverage limits customary for U.S. public companies similarly situated to
Parent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) From and after the Effective Time, Surviving Entity shall
pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that are incurred by
the persons referred to in this Section 5.6 in connection with their
successful enforcement of the rights provided to such persons in this Section
5.6. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The provisions of this Section 5.6 are intended to be in
addition to the rights otherwise available to the current and former officers
and directors of Parent and the Company by Law, charter, statute, bylaw or
agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) In the event Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.6. Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to perform
all of the obligations of the Surviving Entity under this Section 5.6. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.7 Additional Agreements. The Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be taken all actions necessary to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Party to this Agreement: (a) shall make all filings and other
submissions (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and
given by such Party in connection with the Contemplated Transactions; (b)
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) reasonably
required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or Contract, or
otherwise) by such Party in connection with the Contemplated Transactions or
for such Contract to remain in full force and effect; (c) shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to lift any injunction prohibiting, or any
other legal bar to, the Contemplated Transactions; and (d) shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent to the
consummation of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8 Disclosure. Without limiting any Party's obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement, no Party shall, and no Party shall permit any
of its Subsidiaries or any Representative of such Party to, issue any press
release or make any disclosure (to any customers or employees of such Party,
to the public or otherwise) regarding the Contemplated Transactions unless:
(a) the other Party shall have approved such press release or disclosure in
writing, such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed; or (b) such disclosure is requested by a Governmental Body or such
Party shall have determined in good faith that such disclosure is required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service
and, to the extent practicable, before such press release or disclosure is
issued or made, such Party shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
advise the other Party of, and consult with the other Party regarding, the
text of such press release or disclosure; provided, however, that Parent may
make any public statement in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are consistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by the
Company or Parent in compliance with this Section 5.8. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.9 Listing. At all times prior to Closing, Parent shall
maintain its listing on the NYSE American Market. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, (a) to the extent required by the rules and
regulations of the NYSE American Market, to prepare and submit to the NYSE
American Market a notification form for the listing of the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Contemplated Transactions,
and to cause such shares to be approved for listing (subject to official
notice of issuance); and (b) to the extent required

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-49-  \t\t

  

by the NYSE American Market Rule 101, to file an initial listing application
for the Parent Common Stock on the NYSE American Market (the "NYSE Listing
Application") and to cause such the NYSE Listing Application to be
conditionally approved prior to the Effective Time. The Parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate with respect to compliance with
the NYSE rules and regulations. Parent agrees to pay all the NYSE fees
associated with the NYSE Listing Application. The Company will cooperate with
Parent as reasonably requested by Parent with respect to the NYSE Listing
Application and promptly furnish to Parent all information concerning the
Company and its members that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this Section 5.9. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.10 Tax Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) For United States federal income Tax purposes, the Parties
intend that the Merger constitute a transaction described in Section 351(a) of
the Code (the "Intended Tax Treatment"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take any action or cause
any action to be taken which action would reasonably be expected to prevent
the Merger from qualifying, for the Intended Tax Treatment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.11 Directors and Officers. The Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts and take all necessary action so that immediately after the
Effective Time, (a) the Parent Board is comprised of up to seven (7) members
designated by the Company and (b) the Persons listed in Exhibit E under the
heading "Officers" are elected or appointed, as applicable, to the positions
of officers of Parent and the Surviving Entity, as set forth therein, to serve
in such positions effective as of the Effective Time until successors are duly
appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law. If any Person
listed in Exhibit E is unable or unwilling to serve as an officer of Parent or
the Surviving Entity, as set forth therein, as of the Effective Time, the
Parties shall mutually agree upon a successor. The Persons listed in Exhibit E
under the heading "Board Designees" shall be the Company's designees pursuant
to clause (a) of this Section 5.11 (which list may be changed by the Company
at any time prior to the Closing by written notice to Parent). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.12 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Laws) to cause any acquisitions of Parent Common
Stock and any options to purchase Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, by each individual who is reasonably expected to
become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act. At least thirty (30) days prior to the Anticipated Closing
Date, the Company shall furnish the following information to Parent for each
individual who, immediately after the Effective Time, will become subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to Parent: (a) the number of shares of Company Equity owned by such individual
and expected to be exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger, and (b) the number of other derivative securities (if any) with
respect to Company Equity owned by such individual and expected to be
converted into shares of Parent Common Stock or derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.13 Cooperation. Each Party shall cooperate reasonably with the
other Party and shall provide the other Party with such assistance as may be
reasonably requested for the purpose of facilitating the performance by each
Party of its respective obligations under this Agreement and to enable the
combined entity to continue to meet its obligations following the Effective
Time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.14 Allocation Certificate. The Company will prepare and deliver
to Parent at least ten days prior to the Anticipated Closing Date a
certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent to update Exhibit C so as to set forth (as of
immediately prior to the Effective

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-50-  \t\t

  

Time) (a) each holder of Company membership interests, (b) such holder's name
and address; (c) the number and type of Company Equity held; and (d) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to such holder pursuant
to this Agreement in respect of the Company Equity held by such holder as of

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.15 Company Financial Statements. As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company will furnish to
Parent audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2019, for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement (the
"Company Audited Financial Statements"), and for each interim period completed
prior to Closing that would be required to be included in the Registration
Statement or any periodic report due prior to the Closing if the Company were
subject to the periodic reporting requirements under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (the "Company Interim Financial Statements"). Each of the Company
Audited Financial Statements and the Company Interim Financial Statements will
be suitable for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement and prepared in accordance with GAAP as applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except in each case as described in the
notes thereto) and on that basis will present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position and the results of operations, changes in
members' equity, and cash flows of the Company as of the dates of and for the
periods referred to in the Company Audited Financial Statements or the Company
Interim Financial Statements, as the case may be. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.16 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Contemplated Transactions, each of the Company, the Company
Managers, Parent and the Parent Board, as applicable, shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Contemplated
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the Contemplated Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.17 Calculation of Parent Net Cash. At least ten (10) days prior
to the Anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall deliver the Parent Net Cash
Schedule to the Company. Upon the reasonable request of the Company, Parent
shall make the work papers and back-up materials used or useful in preparing
the Parent Net Cash Schedule available to the Company. Within three (3)
Business Days after Parent delivers the Parent Net Cash Schedule to the
Company (the "Parent Net Cash Response Date"), subject to the terms and
definitions of this Agreement, the Company will have the right to dispute any
part of such Parent Net Cash Schedule by delivering a written notice to that
effect to Parent (a "Company Dispute Notice"). Any Company Dispute Notice
shall identify in reasonable detail the nature of any proposed revisions to
the calculation of Parent Net Cash set forth in the Parent Net Cash Schedule.
If on or prior to the Parent Net Cash Response Date, (i) the Company notifies
Parent in writing that it has no objections to the Parent Net Cash Schedule or
(ii) the Company fails to deliver a Company Dispute Notice, then Parent Net
Cash as set forth in the Parent Net Cash Schedule shall be deemed to have been
finally determined for purposes of this Agreement and to represent the Parent
Net Cash at the Anticipated Closing Date for purposes of this Agreement. If
the Company delivers a Company Dispute Notice on or prior to the Parent Net
Cash Response Date, then members of senior management of Parent and the
Company shall promptly meet in person or telephonically at mutually agreed
upon times and attempt in good faith to resolve the disputed item(s) and
negotiate an agreed-upon determination of Parent Net Cash, which agreed upon
Parent Net Cash amount shall be deemed to have been finally determined for
purposes of this Agreement and to represent the Parent Net Cash at the
Anticipated Closing Date for purposes of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.18 Parent Lease Obligations. Parent represents that its current
aggregate obligations under the Real Estate Lease do not exceed $1,500,000.
Parent shall use reasonable efforts from and after the date hereof (a) to
terminate, assign or sublease the Real Estate Lease, such that it shall no
longer have any obligation under the Lease (or such liabilities shall be
materially reduced), and (b) to satisfy all of its liabilities (including any
liabilities

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-51-  \t\t

  

created by any "Black Scholes" fundamental transaction provisions contained in
any outstanding warrants of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) other than
Permitted Liabilities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.19 Funding Condition. The Company shall use reasonable efforts
from and after the date hereof to arrange for and thereafter consummate the
Timber Funding and satisfy the funding condition in Section 7.4, and Parent
shall use reasonable efforts to provide information to potential financing
providers and otherwise to assist the Company in such efforts to secure
financing so as to satisfy such funding conditions. \t\t

 \t\t\t10.9 Cooperation. Each Party agrees to cooperate fully with the
other Party and to execute and deliver such further documents, certificates,
agreements and instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably
requested by the other Party to evidence or reflect the Contemplated
Transactions and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified. In the event
such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence,
the Parties agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve,

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-60-  \t\t

  

to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
invalid or unenforceable term or provision. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.11 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties
agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any Party does
not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breaches such provisions.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such order or injunction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than
the Parties and the DandO Indemnified Parties to the extent of their respective
rights pursuant to Section 5.6) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include masculine and feminine genders. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiating
and drafting of this Agreement and agree that any rule of construction to the
effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party shall
not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and
"including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The use of the word "or" shall not be exclusive. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement,
respectively. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Any reference to legislation or to any provision of any
legislation shall include any modification, amendment, re-enactment thereof,

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) The Parties agree that each of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections and
subsections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Agreement. The disclosures in any section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule shall qualify other sections and subsections in this Agreement to the
extent it is readily apparent on its face from a reading of the disclosure
that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections and
subsections. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Each of "delivered" or "made available" means, with
respect to any documentation, that prior to 11:59 p.m. (San Francisco time) on
the date that is two calendar days prior to the date of this Agreement (i) a
copy of such material has been posted to and made available by a Party to the
other Party and its Representatives in the electronic data room maintained by
such disclosing Party or (ii) such material is disclosed in the Parent SEC
Documents publicly made available on the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering
Analysis and Retrieval system. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) Whenever the last day for the exercise of any privilege or
the discharge of any duty hereunder shall fall upon a Saturday, Sunday, or any
date on which banks in San Francisco, California are authorized or obligated
by Law to be closed, the Party having such privilege or duty may exercise such
privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding day which is a regular
Business Day. \t\t
